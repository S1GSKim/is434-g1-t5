2021-02-26 21:34:07+00:00,30,"In late September, before covid-19 swept through southern Illinois like a prairie fire, before nearly every single resident of a nursing home in Du Quoin was infected, before the disease pushed Perry County’s rural health-care system to the breaking point, confidence was in the air.

The county clerk, Beth Lipe, realized the pandemic wasn’t causing any rush for absentee ballots. Of 9,300 applications she mailed out, she got back fewer than 1,000 requests, about the same as any other year.

The staff of the St. Nicholas Brewing Co. on a Friday afternoon set up 10 tables for their evening food and bar service next door in the parking lot of the Du Quoin State Bank. As usual, fewer than half their customers showed up in masks.

Fairview Rehabilitation and Healthcare, on East Jackson Street, had yet to see a single case of covid-19, six months into the pandemic. “I had escaped it,” said the home’s owner, Scott Stout. “We hoped and we prayed.” That month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded the nursing home a $19,000 incentive grant recognizing its superior infection-control procedures, one of thousands of such grants across the nation.

Elsewhere in the United States, the death toll passed 200,000. But up at the north end of Washington Street, the nurses at Marshall Browning Hospital, a 25-bed “critical access” facility, were beginning to exhale because there had been so few signs of the illness since a brief flurry in the spring.

“We had a really long grace period,” said Amy Blakemore, the medical-surgical nurse manager at the hospital. “I’m going to attribute it to sheer dumb luck that we kept our numbers as low as we did as long as we did.”

Du Quoin’s experience with covid-19 this past fall was typical of hundreds of small towns across the United States. Alarm when the pandemic began gave way to a mixture of complacency, denial and resistance to public health measures as the disease seemed for so long to be passing rural America by.

“We’re prone to that make-believe way of thinking,” Blakemore said. “It’s not going to happen here. It’s a city thing.”

But when it became real, spreading across the Midwest, filling hospitals to capacity, many nursing homes found that good infection control on paper was no match for an insidiously contagious virus. The inspection system for American nursing homes left them ill-equipped to deal with the novel coronavirus and, in far too many cases, blind to the threat. At the moment of crisis, a lack of hospital space forced nursing home staffers to take on the burden of covid-19 care — an obligation many shouldered with heroic dedication, but lacked proper equipment and training to fulfill.

What happened at the Fairview Rehabilitation and Healthcare center, where the coronavirus infected 42 residents and killed a quarter of them, was not an exception. Resthaven Nursing and Rehabilitation in Lake Charles, La., had no cases in September, October or November, then nearly 100 in three weeks in December. Elderwood in Hamburg, N.Y., had none through early December, and then 48 in the month that followed. Windber Woods in Paint, Pa., had none through late November, then 45 over the next six weeks. Parke View Rehabilitation and Care Center in Burley Falls, Idaho, had three cases in all of last year, and 24 this year.

Each of those nursing homes received incentive grants from HHS in the fall for good infection control, ranging from $34,000 to $69,000.

In Perry County, there had been just one death all spring, a 58-year-old long-haul trucker who was joking with nurses when he showed up at the emergency room. A few hours later, he was on a ventilator, and not long after that, he died.

Health-care workers and nursing home staffers and administrators understood the need for vigilance. Du Quoin Mayor Guy Alongi urged residents to adhere to national and state guidelines. The Perry County fair was canceled for the first time since 1856, then the late-summer Du Quoin State Fair was, too.

But Perry County, about 80 miles southeast of St. Louis, is a deeply conservative place. President Donald Trump received 72 percent of the 2020 vote there, and a steady diet of contrarian attacks on mask-wearing and social distancing on TV and in social media, in the name of liberty, had an effect.

Alongi, whose family has run a restaurant in Du Quoin since 1933, said residents had asked him to somehow countermand an Oct. 19 order by Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) reimposing a ban on indoor seating at dining establishments.

That the disease had not made a real appearance there, that it was still an abstraction, sharpened residents’ skepticism.

But November’s eruption illuminated a deeper, underlying small-town problem. Marshall Browning Hospital has no intensive care nurses. The nearest ICU is 25 miles away, at Memorial Hospital of Carbondale, and when that filled up, patients were looking at a two- or three-hour ambulance ride to the nearest ICU. After the Carbondale hospital was out of space, as it would be in November, the best options were in Missouri, Indiana or Kentucky.

During quiet month, warning signs

In Collinsville, a suburb of St. Louis on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River, Edythe Walston was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. It was Sept. 15.

Divorced when her three children were still small, she had a long career as an administrative assistant at the Peabody Coal Co., followed by a few years as a laboratory administrator in St. Louis.

Walston lived alone in the old family house in Collinsville, tending to her vegetable garden, caring for her cats and volunteering at the local pet rescue organization. She had been a conscientious newspaper reader all her life, but by now she was 85, suffering from heart disease and showing signs of mild dementia. All summer, she had been having recurring bouts of pneumonia, and in September it flared up again.

The hospital stabilized her and, with the pandemic putting pressure on all the hospitals in the St. Louis metropolitan area, sent her by cab to a local nursing home two days later.

Walston’s daughter, Vicki Short, drove up as soon as she could from her home near Carbondale. Short, who is 52, had been living in Madison, Wis., but moved back with her wife, Jess, to Illinois so she could be closer to her mother.

Walston was too feeble to go home, but Short was deeply disturbed by the conditions she found at the nursing home. “It felt like a warehouse,” she said. Worse, her mother had been hurt in a fall the day after she was admitted. Short resolved to find a place closer to where she and Jess lived.

On Sept. 26, an ambulance took her to the Fairview nursing home, a one-story brick building in Du Quoin across the street from a company that manufactures commercial holiday decor. There, about a 90-minute drive from the St. Louis metropolitan area where Walston had lived and worked, Short hoped the staff would have the time to do what they could to make her mother’s life as meaningful as possible. As she was about to be wheeled in, Short gave her a hug. It was their last.

Walston was placed in a two-week quarantine. A coronavirus test came back negative. In a small town in the heart of the country, she and her daughter were outsiders.

On the surface, October was another quiet month. Fairview kept the virus at bay and federal regulators awarded it another incentive grant for quality infection control, this time for $48,000.

But all along there had been warning signs, some more obvious than others. A nursing home about 13 miles away, also operated by Stout’s company, had 46 confirmed cases and three deaths during an outbreak in August. Stout said he and the staff at his firm, WLC Management, ran through many scenarios to think through how to avoid a repeat occurrence.

Handling a pandemic was a dire responsibility. Stout said he was frustrated by the constantly changing advice from federal and state health agencies. “You got to juggle all these guidelines,” he said. “I told everybody, ‘Give us the playbook. Tell me exactly what we need to do, and we’ll do it.' ”

Stout, 49, studied to be a mortician before he went into the nursing home business, and also owns a bar-and-grill. WLC operates 11 nursing homes and one assisted-living center in southern Illinois, and they get high marks from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that regulates nursing homes. Fairview has four stars, out of a possible five.

Yet a deeper dive into the reports compiled on every nursing home in the United States shows that in 2019, Fairview rehabilitation patients were 20 percent more likely than the average to return to the hospital for treatment, and were more than four times as likely to be treated with antipsychotic medications. Long-stay residents were almost twice as likely to require emergency room visits, and three times as likely to have urinary tract infections.

Stout said these figures are misleading: “They don’t give you the full picture.""

Blakemore, the nurse manager at Marshall Browning Hospital, said she believes that nursing home residents in her part of the state are generally in worse health than elsewhere to start with, because this is the sort of rural community where families “turn themselves inside out” to care for the elderly at home as long as possible. “By the time families are ready to concede this is more than they can do,” she said, “those residents are really on the downhill slide.”

Optimism prevailed, but virus crept in

Throughout October and into November, Vicki and Jess Short went to Fairview and visited with Walston as best they could, sitting outside a window on a bench and using a baby monitor to talk. Walston was getting confused, and Vicki Short could see that the edema she suffered in her legs was getting worse because they weren’t properly propped up. “We just tried to keep her spirits up,” Vicki Short said. “It sucked.”

Some of the staffers were thoughtful and caring, she said, but others seemed to show “a lack of empathy or compassion, or they’re all just horribly burned out.”

On Oct. 11, state health officials held a Zoom call with local officeholders in southern Illinois, telling them the positivity rate for coronavirus tests in their region was growing fast, reaching 7.3 percent.

It had an effect. “Finally the ball-peen hammer hit the head and knocked some sense into it,” said Alongi, the Du Quoin mayor, “and people masked up.”

[How government incentives shaped the nursing home business — and left it vulnerable to a pandemic]

Three days later, the Perry County Board of Health renewed a discussion from summer about priorities for spending an $800,000 contact-tracing grant from the state.

November was calm to start with. Election Day came and went. Perry County turnout was strong, and in person, and Trump clobbered Joe Biden throughout most of southern Illinois.

While voters were at the polls Nov. 3, Fairview tested all of its staffers for the coronavirus. Two days later, the results came back: all negative. The nursing home, locked down since spring, sent out a text message to families (which Short shared with The Post): “The positivity rate continues to climb in our region. We are monitoring it daily and will adjust our testing schedule as required. We are working on plans to reopen for visits and will notify you as soon as this is allowed.”

The optimism turned out to be misplaced.

Staff tests were stepped up to twice a week. On Nov. 12 came word that one employee had tested positive. A text message assured families, “We will continue to test twice a week, Tuesday and Friday, until we have two weeks of negative testing. Until further notice, all dining and activities will be done in the resident rooms.”

But there was no stopping it.

“All it needed was that one little crack to get in there,” Blakemore said. “And then it was like gasoline on a brush fire.”

Five residents tested positive on the 13th, the first since the pandemic began, according to Fairview’s text messages. Nine more were added on the 17th, four more on the 19th, plus four employees. As symptoms began to show, staffers created an isolation wing for the ill, but the virus stayed ahead of them. In that first week, Fairview reported 18 resident cases to CMS, 22 more the next week, a total of 42 by early December.

All but a very few residents, in other words, showed signs of the coronavirus. Eventually, at least 11 would die of the disease.

“I was at Fairview when the breakout happened,” Stout said. “We were heartbroken because we hoped it wouldn’t get in the building. But the virus started spreading so quick.” His staff followed proper procedures when moving residents, he said. “We put a face mask on them and we gowned them up.”

After that first text message from Fairview about a positive test result, Vicki Short said, “we’re thinking, okay, she’s in a room alone, she’s asymptomatic, she’s got a fighting chance here.”

But as the next few days went by, Short learned her mother had picked up a cough. Short couldn’t visit because of the lockdown, so she couldn’t see what was happening.

Her mother was lethargic and had trouble getting her words out when Short called her. A coronavirus test on Nov. 23 came back positive. A health coordinator called Short a day later: Her mother was in trouble. There was no room at Marshall Browning Hospital. Walston was turning blue from a lack of oxygen. Another call: A bed had just opened up at the hospital.

Blakemore had the “hard conversation” with Short when her mother was admitted. “I just remember telling her that we were going to take good care of her and keep her comfortable,” Blakemore said. “Her mom was really, really sick. I remember it being really sad. It’s just a really heartbreaking thing to know there’s nothing you can do for them.”

Edythe Walston died at 6:12 the next morning.

“Mom was very strong-willed, like people of her generation,” Short said. To see her go that way, cut off and alone, no hugs or kisses, has left a hole, for her and Jess both.

“It’s amazing how life throws things at you, and you go down a path you didn’t intend. Love is love. We didn’t plan on losing Mom so quickly. We’re kind of like an open book and the chapter hasn’t been written yet.”

[Task force says nursing homes need more aid. Critics say industry should step up.]

‘A sense of failure’

All these weeks, Blakemore, 52, had been managing the nursing staff of about 40 at the hospital. Covid-19 victims “would come to our ER and we couldn’t get them transferred anywhere, because all the ICU beds were full,” she said. “You’re asking us to do ICU stuff, and we’re [medical-surgical] nurses. We did a lot of education on the fly. There’s no evidence-based practice for this, so we were making it up as we went along. Everybody in rural health care was probably in the same boat.”

The advantage of a small town, she said, is that everybody knows everybody, and a lot of people pulled together to try to get through the crisis. At the two nursing homes in Du Quoin (the other one is also a WLC property, next door to Fairview and also stricken by the virus), staff knew they’d have to care in place for patients who would normally be sent to the hospital. There were calls back and forth, asking for advice, asking for help. Blakemore sent hospital nurses to the nursing homes to assist in setting up intravenous lines.

“It was just an intense time,” she said. “The numbers at our nursing homes were very sadly so high. We had kept it out so long. It was almost a sense of failure when it got there. It was a team effort to dig out of that hole.”

She could sense that her staff was starting to dread coming to work, afraid of doing the wrong thing. “These are good-hearted people,” said Blakemore. “They were worried they wouldn’t be up to the challenge of it. It took a lot of coaching and almost mom-cheerleading: ‘We’re going to get through this together. It’s not going to be easy.’ ”

Anand Patel, a physician who had experience in ICUs, was a “godsend,” she said, helping the staff work their way through the challenges.

On her way home, she’d sometimes stop off at Walmart and be shocked to see so many customers without masks. “You don’t understand,” she’d think. “This is a whole different animal. You think you’ve got a handle on it, and then it explodes like a nuclear bomb.”

When the month began, Perry County, population 20,000, had experienced fewer than 500 coronavirus cases over seven months, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. By Nov. 12, when word came of the first positive test at Fairview, the county had 653 cases. By the end of the month, 1,238. By the end of January, 2,940, or nearly 15 percent of the county’s residents. That’s almost double the percentage of New York City’s caseload. Fifty-six have died.

The hospital stepped up its efforts to communicate with the town through its Facebook page, emphasizing masks, hand-washing and social distancing. “There are just some people you cannot convince,” said Pam Logan, who runs the page. And, she added, they won’t listen until someone in their family gets seriously ill.

Blakemore’s great-grandmother, Ella McMurtrie, was the first formally trained nurse at a community hospital in Sparta, Ill. During the 1918 flu pandemic, she knocked on doors, asking residents about symptoms, urging them to wear masks, to stay home. She visited the homes of Black families who either wouldn’t, or more likely couldn’t, be treated at the hospital.

“I guess door-to-door is what you did before Facebook,” Blakemore said.

She keeps a portrait of McMurtrie on her wall. “Judging me. Every time I get frustrated, I look up at her, and I go, ‘Okay, fine. Okay, fine, Gram.’ ”

[Nursing homes say they ‘treat in place.’ Then came covid-19.]

Stout said he doesn’t know what else his staff at Fairview could have done. “This virus, I don’t think anybody really knows how it spreads,” he said. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the virus is primarily spread through airborne droplets.)

He’s angry at the criticism nursing homes have received. “I haven’t been in a real festive mood. I care about my staff, my team members. I care about my residents. The sad thing, everybody wants to talk negative about long-term care. We get up every day and fight the good fight. We’ve stayed on top of it. But all everybody wants to do is come in and scrutinize us.”

The people who work for him can’t cut themselves off from the community, he said. They still have to go to the store, and they can’t help mingling there with people who don’t wear masks. They can’t eliminate the risk of exposure. By the end of the outbreak, 18 staffers had tested positive.

And unlike other kinds of businesses, a nursing home can’t shut down. “My staff never got a break,” he said. “This isn’t an easy job. You couldn’t go to your house and hide and sit at your computer and look out the window.”

He said he is proud of the way his staff responded. “You think I haven’t asked myself a million times what I could have done different? You think I haven’t had sleepless nights? Everybody makes mistakes, but we’ve been doing everything we could think of doing.”

Barbara Stevenson, the administrator of the Perry County Health Department, said she thought the staff at Fairview and other local nursing homes did as well as they could, given the realities they were facing: close quarters in the facilities and a high positivity rate in the city and county. Residents at high risk because of their underlying health are going to have a high death rate, she said.

“These are things you honestly can’t fix,” she said. “I guess if we had found a strategy that helped, I definitely would have been asking for it.”

Vicki and Jess Short both came down with covid-19 in December, just as the outbreak was waning in Perry County, but have slowly recovered. Vicki is grieving and angry. Grieving at the way her mother, stubborn and self-sufficient all her life, spent her last confusing, unhappy days. Angry because she believes she wasn’t getting a full picture from Fairview as to what was happening. “We couldn’t get any answers. How do they do infection control? Just to not even have that transparency is scary and awful.”

Angry, too, because it seemed that state and national health officials had done little through the 10 months of the pandemic to get a better handle on nursing home practices. “They basically throw their hands up and say, ‘It’s very contagious. It’s a tragedy.’ It’s a very piecemeal, hodgepodge, ridiculous system, especially in rural counties. What are you guys doing to learn from the tragedy that happened to my mom?”

A consultant with the Illinois Department of Public Health, Deborah Burdsall, said the nursing homes that have had the best results in keeping the coronavirus out were those that jumped into high gear at the first sign of infection. The pandemic, she said, “had driven home the need for comprehensive infection prevention and control in long-term care facilities, and it will happen.”

Stout is angry because he says he needs more staff, but it’s nearly impossible to hire anyone. He estimates that 35 percent of his 650 employees companywide left in 2020. He blames enhanced unemployment insurance. “This day and age, the government’s gone too easy on handouts, and no one wants to work,” he said.

“I wish somebody in the Biden administration would call me and ask me about my work, day in and day out,” he said. “Every day of our lives. We are dedicated.”

At the St. Nicholas Brewing Co., diners are seated inside now that the positivity rate has declined, at widely spaced tables. General manager Abby Ancell, who pioneered farm-to-table dining in Du Quoin, is especially proud of the fish tacos. People still show up without masks; the restaurant has a stash by the door for patrons to wear while they walk to their tables. Some roll their eyes. Others turn on their heels and walk out. “Small-town southern Illinois, you never know what you’re going to get,” Ancell said.

“A lot of people think it’s over,” said Dan Eaves, the head of Marshall Browning Hospital. “We still have churches that are allowing people to come without masks. It’s very disappointing.”

Blakemore is wary. “We could easily have another November if we don’t maintain the caution and follow the guidelines and listen to the science,” she said. Du Quoin can’t go back to the reckless and complacent way things were last summer, she said, “where everybody says, let’s take a big, deep breath, let’s go about our lives, let’s rip our masks off, or go on a vacation, or let’s have a prom, or let’s have a party, or let’s have a wedding with 400 guests. Getting people to understand that it’s not time yet — that’s the biggest challenge.”

And if people don’t listen, and the disease erupts again even as vaccinations are starting?

We don’t actually know how many people have died of complications from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus that likely arrived in the United States at some point last year. There are a lot of reasons for that, including the uncertainty around when the virus actually arrived.

We don’t know how many people may have died of covid-19 without the disease having been confirmed. We can compare the death toll with prior years and see that the United States recorded hundreds of thousands more deaths in 2020 than in 2019, but at this point we’re talking about a scale at which individual tragedies become blurry. To historians, the difference between 500,500 deaths and 499,500 deaths is a subtle one in the “a million deaths is a statistic” sense. In human terms, those 1,000 deaths are 1,000 people vanished from the Earth sooner than would otherwise have happened.

It’s also unclear how many deaths have occurred because the data we have are necessarily out of date, playing catch-up as deaths occur each day or are tallied from deaths in the past. Virginia, for example, is still logging deaths that occurred during the holidays. As the pandemic emerged, there was no real-time central clearinghouse of data on coronavirus deaths, leading media outlets to generate their own varying counts. Those are usually not in sync.

But even if we knew with certainty that the country’s 500,000th coronavirus death occurred this week, it’s a scale that’s simply beyond our ability to apprehend. We are able to distinguish visually the difference between 5,000, 50,000 and 500,000, but conceptually everything in the multi-thousands tends to blur together. That’s more true at the scale of trillions, a figure nearly incomprehensibly large. But it’s also true to some extent at the scale we’re discussing now.

One way to consider what 500,000 deaths mean is to put it in a scale we’re familiar with: time. As I write, it is about 11 a.m. on Feb. 23, 2021. If each of those deaths were to occur at one-second intervals beginning right now, the 500,000th death wouldn’t occur for more than a week. It takes hours simply to tally the deaths that occurred through the spring of last year. Put in seconds, the toll is agonizingly slow.

The graphic above uses estimated demographic data based on the number of deaths by race and ethnicity at the state level, as well as national gender data. The number of deaths each day in each state is accurate as reported by the COVID Tracking Project.

Even when sped up, it’s grueling. If you show 10 deaths per second, you’re still not going to reach the 500,000th death for more than 13 hours.

This perspective is more useful, I think, than comparisons to other disasters and mass-casualty events like wars. Far more Americans have died of covid-19 than died in World War II, but World War II is barely apprehensible in itself.

There’s another way to look at it, as well: visually. We’re used to seeing abstract representations of the death toll through graphs or, as the New York Times showed on Sunday, as individual dots on a graph. But we can also approximate the toll by substituting each death with an image of a person.

The visualization below will display slightly fewer than 500,000 images, all taken from the artificial-intelligence image generating system at thispersondoesnotexist.com. These people don’t exist, but we’ve blurred the images anyway to reduce the likelihood that they resemble actual people.

It’s enough people that the visualization will likely strain your computer or phone. It will take a while to load, during which time your browser will likely not be responsive. This is not ideal but, in a way, it reinforces the point: The scale is remarkable.

Three days after a woman received a double-lung transplant at a Michigan hospital last fall, she became seriously ill. She had difficulty breathing and a high fever, and her lung scans showed pneumonia — all symptoms of a severe case of covid-19. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight When a nasal swab test for the virus came back negative, the woman’s doctor, Daniel Kaul, was not convinced she did not have the coronavirus. So, Kaul dug deeper. He ordered a coronavirus test of a sample collected from the woman’s new lungs.

When the results came back positive, Kaul wondered, “Could this [have] come from the donor?”

Additional tests would soon confirm Kaul’s suspicions: The unnamed woman, who died of covid-19 two months later, had indeed contracted the virus from her donor’s infected lungs. Kaul’s discovery was published in a peer-reviewed paper by the American Journal of Transplantation earlier this month.

“This is at least the first proven case of transmission of covid-19 via organ transplantation in the United States,” Kaul, director of Michigan Medicine’s transplant infectious-disease service, told The Washington Post on Monday night.

Although the paper identifies a novel new path for the virus, Kaul said the risk of contracting it from a transplant procedure is extremely low and says his report should not discourage anyone from considering a transplant. Instead, he said, it points to the need for more testing to prevent similar cases in the future.

Last year, more than 39,000 transplants were performed in the United States, according to data compiled by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), including around 2,500 lung surgeries. Some covid-19 patients have also begun receiving lung transplants. Last June, a woman in her 20s whose lungs were punctured by the disease became the first known covid-19 patient to receive a double-lung transplant in the United States.

Kaul declined to disclose specific details about the donor and the recipient, as well as additional details regarding the time frame of the surgery, to protect their identities.

The donor, a woman from the Upper Midwest who became brain dead after a severe car accident, and the recipient, a woman who suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were matched last fall, according to Kaul’s report.

Both women underwent multiple tests and clinical assessments before the surgery was approved. The donor, who was given a coronavirus nasal swab test within 48 hours of procurement, tested negative. Lung scans also did not show any indication of covid-19, Kaul said. The woman’s family told doctors she had “no history of travel” or any recent symptoms, including fever, cough, headache or diarrhea.

The recipient also tested negative for the virus 12 hours before the transplant.

The day of the procedure at University Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., the surgery went off without any complications, the report states. Later that day, the recipient was taken to the intensive care unit to begin her recovery. But three days later, the woman began exhibiting severe covid-19 symptoms. After her negative nasal swab, doctors also collected a fluid sample from deep inside her lungs, which came back positive.

“I was seeing the patient and I was very concerned that this could have come from the donor because it would be really unusual that it would be down deep in the lungs but not in the upper respiratory tract [nose and throat,]” Kaul told The Post.

He added, “So then, the question became how do we prove that? How do we figure out where did it come from?”

To answer that question, Kaul tested fluid that had been collected from the donor’s lungs during procurement. It came back positive.

“That said: These lungs were infected,” Kaul told The Post. “These lungs had covid in them before they got into the recipient.”

Around this same time, about three days after the procedure, one of the surgeons who had direct contact with the lungs also began showing symptoms. He later tested positive for the virus, but did not require hospitalization, Kaul said.

Kaul performed one last round of tests to confirm that the recipient contracted the virus from the donor’s lungs, a procedure known as sequencing, which he described as similar to the DNA sequencing performed when analyzing a crime scene. “That sequencing showed that it was the same virus that spread from the donor, to the recipient, to the surgeon,” Kaul told The Post.

As weeks went by, the woman’s condition deteriorated. Kaul’s team gave her every treatment they had available, including two rounds of remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy on two occasions, but her body weakened, the physician said. She was put on a bypass machine to oxygenate her blood, but was disconnected after it became clear she would not sustain another lung transplant. She died 61 days after the surgery.

The surgeon who was infected has since recovered.

Kaul said his report offers important guidelines for doctors and organ donation organizations.

“The lesson that we learned and that we feel strongly about is that all lung donors should have a lower respiratory tract specimen checked” for coronavirus, Kaul said, noting that about 1 in 3 lung donors get this type of test before transplant surgery.

Some laboratories lack experience beyond nasal swab testing, Kaul said, while in other cases, organ donation groups don’t have enough time to perform the tests while the organ is still viable for transplant.

“We need to overcome those barriers and do this testing for every lung,” Kaul said. “The reason that we chose to report this is that we think it’s really important people in the transplant community are aware of this transmission so that we can work to have a system where lower [respiratory] tract specimen are checked on all lung donors.”

It is still unknown whether organs other than lungs could be capable of transmitting covid-19, Kaul said.

By the light of 500 candles as “Amazing Grace” played outside the White House, President Biden bowed his head in a minute of reflection on the 500,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, crossing himself after the music faded out. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Moments earlier, the president noted that the U.S. death toll from the pandemic has exceeded both world wars and the Vietnam War combined.

“The people we lost were extraordinary,” Biden said in the White House’s Cross Hall. “They span generations. Born in America, immigrated to America. But just like that, so many of them took their final breath alone in America.”

Somber reminders will endure for the rest of the week, with flags flying at half-staff at all federal buildings, parks and other properties.

Although it was not reflected in the solemn sundown ceremony, Monday also brought decidedly good news on the coronavirus front. The pace of vaccinations is accelerating, deaths and new infections are sharply down, and worries about just how bad the pandemic can get are being replaced with halting questions about when, exactly, all this will be behind us.

But those positive signs have been played down by a federal government that opted this week to focus on the grim pandemic milestone and is cautious of giving Americans an excuse to lower their guards prematurely. From top to bottom, the Biden administration has been less than exuberant about some of the most positive news on the pandemic front since Biden was inaugurated a month ago.

Partly this reflects the classic political view that it is risky to tout good news before the battle is won, and a recognition that the trends could still be reversed.

Beyond that, government experts under Biden worry that if they are too ebullient about the positive strides, it will prompt pandemic-weary Americans to relax too soon, becoming less mindful of their masks and the social distancing that remain the strongest weapons against the virus.

An uptick in gatherings or maskless moments could erase the gains the nation has made and seed new infections, experts warn. Adding to the risk is the presence of coravirus variants that can be both more contagious and less affected by existing vaccines.

“Now we peaked, we turned around and we’re coming down,” Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said in an interview. “But we’re still at a weekly average of 68,000 infections. Now is not the time to say, ‘We’re doing really well, let’s pull back.’ ”

The muted mood presents a contrast with the approach taken by former president Donald Trump, who saw himself as booster-in-chief in touting any progress against the virus and spoke openly of his role in promoting positive news about it. Sometimes his pronouncements were not borne out by the facts, especially in highlighting what he said were promising treatments.

The Biden team’s caution was reflected in the quiet tones of Andy Slavitt, a senior White House covid-19 adviser, who started and ended Moday’s White House briefing on the coronavirus on a solemn note, speaking of the tragic milestone of a half-million deaths and reminding people to tune in to Biden’s sundown memorial ceremony.

But between the somber bookends, officials provided some of the most unreservedly good news the nation had received in nearly a year of pandemic-induced isolation.

The seven-day average number of cases is down 75 percent from the peak on Jan. 11, the coronavirus task force reported. The daily hospital admission rate dropped 60 percent since its peak on Jan. 9. Deaths have dropped nearly 39 percent.

There was even more good news when it came to reopening schools, which has been a contentious issue since Biden said he wanted them to be open in his first 100 days.

Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that since the CDC issued its guidance on school reopening about two weeks ago, the number of counties with covid transmission in the “red” zone — enduring the highest transmission rates — has dropped from 90 percent to 60 percent.

Roughly 18 percent of counties have low to moderate transmission, she said, and those counties could have full-time in-person schooling for students in kindergarten through 12th grade, she said. An additional 22 percent were in “substantial” range and should have a hybrid model up to fifth grade.

But Walensky, too, tried to temper the good news, making it clear that the nation is hardly out of the woods.

At the daily White House press briefing, spokeswoman Jen Psaki also made it clear that Biden on Monday would not focus on the positive news in the coronavirus fight, given the sad landmark being observed.

“He is also quite mindful that tonight is not the night to give advice to the public or give an update on progress being made,” Psaki said, adding that the White House was still encouraging Americans to take common-sense protective measures that most can now recite by heart.

From the beginning, Biden and his administration have sought to temper expectations. On the first full day of his presidency, Biden warned that the pandemic would get worse before it got better, adding that a wartime footing was needed to defeat the virus.

Although the federal government has secured enough vaccine to inoculate every American by July, Biden has said it could be Christmas before things begin to feel like normal. Fauci has warned that Americans could still be wearing masks in 2022.

While tempering expectations can be a political reflex, the events of the past few days also show how easy the positive trend can be reversed.

An ice storm, and an ensuing series of devastating power outages, halted vaccine distribution in Texas and surrounding states last week.

Officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency say they have prioritized vaccination sites in their recovery efforts from the storm. But Texas officials say they are worried that shuttered vaccination centers, a lack of running water caused by electric outages, and neighbors huddled together in warming centers could seed new infections, derailing the progress they’ve made.

Biden administration officials also say they recognize it may be a struggle persuading certain vulnerable groups to get a coronavirus vaccine. Minority populations have been harder hit by the virus — Black Americans are more than twice as likely to die of it — and there are signs that they are also more hesitant to take the vaccine, in part due to centuries of medical malpractice at the expense of Black bodies.

That means that even if vaccines are produced in sufficient numbers and distributed effectively to needy areas, it still could take a while for the population to be vaccinated in great enough proportions to achieve herd immunity.

And while the numbers of coronavirus deaths and infections have dropped, they are still not at the point where society can fully reopen. The CDC’s guidance on mask-wearing and social distancing remains unchanged, and the agency still warns on its website: “Cases are extremely high. Avoid travel.”

The pandemic has cost more American lives than several wars the country has fought, Biden said Monday night. And its infectious nature added a particularly painful side effect, he added: It has stopped Americans from engaging in the common rituals of mourning that honor the dead and help survivors share their sorrow.

“That’s what has been so cruel,” said Biden, who has suffered his own share of personal tragedy and put compassion at the heart of his political identity. “So many of the rituals that help us cope, that help us honor those we love, haven’t been available to us.”

He said he hoped Monday’s moment would give at least a semblance of solace.

“We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,” Biden said. “We have to resist seeing each life as a statistic or a blurb on the news.”

This is a moment of terrible tension. We are reaching an unspeakable milestone: the deaths of half a million Americans from covid-19. At the same time, there is unambiguous good news in the fight against the virus. It is possible, finally, to imagine a day when this devastating pandemic is brought to an end. The progress we’ve made toward defeating covid-19 should sharpen our grief, making it clear how many lives we might have saved had we been unified in our response. But even as we mourn, we cannot despair: There are people who will live if we keep up the hard, lonely work still before us.

Since peaking in early January, the daily tally of new cases in this country has plummeted by more than two-thirds. Hospitalizations, an even more reliable measure of the pandemic since they reflect the number of people suffering from serious disease, are falling, too: Fewer than 60,000 people are hospitalized today with covid-19, as opposed to more than 130,000 for several days last month.

Deaths are a lagging indicator, but those, too, have fallen sharply. On Saturday, according to The Post’s tally, the seven-day daily average of deaths was 1,932 — the first time that figure had fallen below 2,000 since Dec. 4.

Why such dramatic improvement? For a definitive answer, you’d have to ask the virus, but there are lots of possible contributing factors. We’re past the string of holidays and occasions — Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, the Super Bowl — that encouraged risky behavior such as large gatherings. Maybe the virus is having a hard time finding new targets in some hard-hit communities. It could be that the coronavirus follows some cyclical rhythm that scientists do not yet fully understand.

But however exhausting it might be, we all have dreary, routine work left to do to combat the virus and to protect ourselves and our fellow citizens. It helps that the federal government now sends a consistent message on the need for the simple measures that are known to prevent transmission of the coronavirus: mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing.

President Biden and his team not only preach these practices but also model them almost religiously — as opposed to the way Donald Trump and his minions equated masklessness with “freedom.” Misguided souls who are convinced that covid-19 is some kind of hoax are probably still unmoved. But others who might be tempted to go without masks at least now cannot use the behavior of the president of the United States as an excuse.

Another possible factor in the apparent waning of the epidemic is the relative success of the rollout of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are both cause for hope and a reminder of the need for persistence.

True, demand so outpaces supply — at the point of delivery, at least — that vaccine-seekers loiter outside vaccination clinics at the end of the day on the off chance that there may be leftover doses. Where I live, the official sign-up list for getting vaccinated was first maintained by the county, then by a local hospital, then once more by the county; now it has been taken over by the state health department. Securing an appointment online involved patience and persistence, and quite a bit of swearing at my laptop and my phone. But I did finally get one. It was worth the effort, both for the relief I felt for myself and my family, and for the small contribution I can make to our collective herd immunity.

As of Monday, according to The Post, 44.1 million Americans had received at least one shot of the two-shot vaccines. That represents more than one-third of the initially targeted population — medical personnel, those over 65, essential workers — and about 13 percent of the total U.S. population. We can and must do better. But according to figures compiled daily by the BBC, only Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Britain have vaccinated more of their citizens per capita than the United States.

In other words, we did much worse than other wealthy countries, and even some poor countries, in controlling the spread of the coronavirus and preventing serious illness and death. But we have done much better than most countries in getting vaccines into people’s arms.

The coronavirus variants are troubling, especially the one first identified in South Africa. It is possible that the virus could come roaring back as quickly as it has ebbed. This is a new disease, and anyone who tells you we fully understand it is lying.

But we now have serious, competent leadership that believes in science, not conspiracy theories. And whatever the reasons, the tragic covid-19 toll — still too high — has fallen dramatically from its horrific peak. We have lost an unimaginable 500,000 lives. But we can keep from losing 500,000 more.

Here are three ways to visualize the monstrous death toll of the coronavirus in this country

A year ago, covid-19 had killed just a handful of people in the United States. Now, the pandemic’s official death toll equals the size of a major city, more than the population of Kansas City, Mo., and nearly as many as Atlanta or Sacramento.

It can be hard to grasp the enormity — almost half a million people, gone. What if we imagined them traveling as one group? Or killed in action? Or all buried together?

[The youngest victims of a national calamity, and the people they left behind]

If 500,000 passengers traveled by bus …

An average motor coach — the kind of bus you would take from one city to another — holds 50 people. Transporting only the number of people who died last month would require dozens of buses.

[A look at three deadly days in the pandemic's deadliest month]

If the Vietnam Veterans Memorial contained 500,000 names …

The coronavirus has killed more people than any war in American history other than the Civil War, in which an estimated 750,000 died.

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall attempts to visually quantify the human toll of one of those wars.

Its two black granite walls rise out of the earth, each nearly 250 feet long, stretching higher until they meet in the center more than 10 feet aboveground. Etched into the surface are more than 58,000 names of men and women who died or remain missing in one of the country’s most divisive conflicts.

For a person standing at the memorial’s center, looking down one long wall of names and then the other, the scale of loss is staggering.

If 500,000 people were buried at Arlington …

Anyone who has visited the rolling slopes of Arlington National Cemetery has had the chilling feeling that the rows of white marble headstones may go on forever. The cemetery, which dates to the Civil War, is the final resting place of troops who fought in every major conflict, including the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.

More than 400,000 people are interred within its 639 acres, and as of 2019, it had room for approximately 95,000 more.

The 1918 flu pandemic killed about 675,000 people in the United States before the virus finally receded.

We are still in the teeth of the current pandemic; it took less than five weeks to go from 400,000 dead to 500,000, and health officials have said the actual toll is probably higher.

But numbers of new covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have recently begun to slow, and more than 1 million vaccine doses are going into American arms every day.

In the story of our times, the political damage inflicted by President Donald Trump will figure prominently. But the raw physical, emotional and economic trauma of the pandemic will predominate. The lessons we draw from Trump may determine the fate of the republic. The lessons we draw from covid-19 may shape the future of the species. What follows is a partial list of the latter.

1. Nature is out to kill us. Don’t be fooled by rainbows and sunsets. Beneath all the beauty is a brutal evolutionary struggle between humans and microbial pathogens. We adapt to new diseases over time; the problem is that pathogens evolve much faster. E. coli, for example, reproduces so quickly that it can pack as many mutations into a day as humans do in a millennium. A new pathogen emerges, on average, every four to five years. Covid-19 has been bad enough, but the larger danger comes from a novel influenza that has a high fatality rate and is highly transmissible before the development of symptoms. Modeling indicates a 3 percent probability each year of a flu pandemic with a fatality rate similar to the 2009 swine flu pandemic (which took from 150,000 to 575,000 lives worldwide in its first year, compared with approximately 2 million deaths after one year of covid-19). There is a 1 percent yearly probability of an influenza pandemic that causes 6 million deaths or more.

2. We are making the problem worse. About 75 percent of new emerging diseases are zoonotic (originating in animals). And humans amplify that threat in a variety of ways. The demand for protein has led to vast increases in the number and concentration of domesticated animals such as pigs, which are grunting petri dishes of disease. At the same time, deforestation is bringing humans into more frequent contact with wildlife such as bats, which effectively spread infection through their waste. Nature offers a poisonous smorgasbord of dangerous pathogens. Scientists in the Predict program have discovered 1,200 animal-borne diseases over the past several years and estimate there may be 700,000 more we don’t know about.

3. Isolation from these threats is a myth. Nearly everywhere on Earth is a day’s plane ride to London or Atlanta. And as we have seen, the spread of disease outside our borders in places such as Brazil, South Africa or Britain can lead to genetic variants that evade immunity or become more deadly. We are far less effective in fighting diseases here if they are not effectively fought elsewhere.

4. Decentralization is good political theory and bad health policy. The U.S. response to covid-19 is divided among more than 3,000 state, local and tribal health departments and agencies — and you can tell. The federal government initially failed to provide adequate support for testing and contact tracing, failed to effectively distribute medical supplies and equipment, failed to standardize epidemic data, and failed to set and enforce rational triggers for stay-at-home orders and school closings. The result has been a patchwork response in which large portions of the country essentially surrendered to the spread of the pathogen.

5. Altruism is not an effective motivator of behavior change. Why have so many Americans failed to take relatively minor preventive steps such as mask-wearing and social distancing? Part of this was because of a president who consistently played down and politicized a public health crisis, for which he has blood on his hands. But the problem runs deeper than red-state resistance. As the disease surged late last year, more than 70 percent of its onward spread came from people ages 20 to 49. But more than 80 percent of the people who have died because of covid-19 (as of early February) are 65 or older. Consciously or not, this is a massive act of intergenerational betrayal. Consider it another way: If you are 65 or older and get the disease, you have a 5.6 percent chance of dying. If you are 20 to 49 and get the disease, you have a .0092 percent chance of dying. It is impossible to avoid the question: How would U.S. behavior have been different if irresponsible actions had been more closely aligned with the risk of death? When those actions and risks are misaligned, only effective government action can make up for the lack of better motives.

Advertisement

6. Though we are better prepared for the next one, we are not prepared for the big one. If our response were calibrated to the urgency of the danger, we would slow deforestation and better police the wildlife trade. We would better regulate or even reconsider factory farming. We would engage in a much broader, ongoing effort to monitor for pathogens that spread from animals to humans. We would speed up the creation of a genetic catalogue of zoonotic diseases that might help us identify and test for new threats. We would invest more to strengthen health systems in the developing world, so they can snuff out the early sparks of infectious disease. We would adequately fund pandemic preparedness in the United States and increase the ability of the federal government to set policy and direct resources during a health crisis.

The possible consequences of our inattention are horrible and entirely foreseeable.

Somewhere in between drinking that last margarita and heading to the airport, travelers leaving Mexico are required to get a coronavirus test before returning to the United States, regardless of vaccination status. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight If you’re staying in a hotel or resort, or your trip was arranged by a travel adviser, you will probably have someone who can arrange testing for you. A concierge should know where to find approved tests or be able to arrange one on-site. Your hotel rate may even include a test.

But what if you’re someone like me who tends to stay in budget accommodations and Airbnbs?

On a recent trip to Mexico, I had to find a coronavirus test on my own. I had heard it would be simple for tourists, so I was confident in the task. While I did find one, I did encounter some hurdles. Here’s some advice for travelers planning to do the same.

What kind of test you’ll need

Anyone 2 years old and up entering the United States, including citizens and residents, must provide proof of a negative test result taken within 24 hours of their flight. (The rule doesn’t apply to people traveling by land or sea.)

Advertisement

Travelers can get a rapid antigen test or a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which includes PCR tests. But because PCR lab tests generally take a day or two to process, it may not be ready in time for your flight.

A better choice is the rapid antigen test, which I took. While the tests are less sensitive than PCR ones, these tend to be the fastest and most affordable testing option, and they deliver results in as little as 15 minutes.

How to start your search

If you’re not sure where to start your search for a test, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico has a covid-19 page on its website where one can find how to acquire a test, whether results are reliably available, how much one should cost and more.

You can also go to the local tourism office for help finding approved labs. Airlines, such as Aeromexico, also have information on their websites for finding tests around Mexico.

I assumed that I would run into coronavirus testing centers wherever I traveled. At first, that didn’t appear to be the case in the first city I visited, Merída, the capital of Yucatán state. If I had done more research, I would have found that there were plenty of options.

However, Google may not have the most up-to-date information on testing options. In the second stop on my trip, Playa del Carmen, I searched on Google Maps for “coronavirus test” and got just a few results at pharmacies. But after walking around town for a day, I saw there were dozens of locations nearby that Google hadn’t flagged.

If all else fails, head to tourist areas

Coronavirus testing centers for travelers are going to be in places that have the most travelers.

On a hunt for a tiny lunch spot far from the beach in Playa del Carmen, I didn’t notice any coronavirus testing centers among the butcher shops, clothing stores and laundromats. But when I turned down the city’s main tourist street, they suddenly were everywhere. They advertised fast results approved by the United States

Advertisement

Prices were around $25 to $30 for a rapid test, and $90 for a PCR. Most accepted walk-ins, but also took reservations if you want to plan ahead.

I spent the last few days of my trip in the beach town of Puerto Morelos. Googling testing options didn’t pull up many results, so I had a backup plan to drive to a larger city such as Cancún or Playa del Carmen. But luckily I found a testing center a block from where I was staying; it just wasn’t reflected online.

For about $25, the center’s lone employee took my ID (your name and birthday needs to be printed on the test results) and administered a rapid test. When the results were ready 15 minutes later, she gave me a printed copy and emailed me the digital version as a backup.

While I don’t recommend waiting until the last minute to get your test, some airports in Mexico have testing on-site. At Cancún International Airport, for example, they advertise first come, first served antigen tests for about $15 with results in 30 to 60 minutes.

Pack an approved self test

If you’d like to skip the process of finding a test altogether, you can bring a CDC-approved “self test” that you take over a video call with real-time supervision from a telehealth service.

Advertisement

One option is the Detect coronavirus test that uses the same technology as a PCR lab test and delivers results in about an hour. A kit costs $75; for $20 extra, travelers can purchase a video observation session so the test can meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requirement.

Last summer, I went with this option for a trip to Europe with the BinaxNOW kit (about $70 for a two pack). The night before my flight home to the United States, I downloaded the required app, followed the instructions and took the test while a telehealth professional walked me through it over a video call.

The testing process took about 25 minutes, plus another 30 minutes to wait for the results (you don’t have to sit around and watch the test.)

Once the results were ready, another telehealth professional came on the line to help interpret the results. We determined it was negative, and soon I received an email confirmation that I could show the airline the next day.

What to do with your results

For my American Airlines flight back from Mexico, I wasn’t allowed to check-in until I uploaded a photo of my coronavirus test result into an app called VeriFLY, which stores your required documents for travel. I sent in my results, had them approved hours later and completed the standard American Airlines check-in process.

Not all airlines use so-called vaccine passports such as VeriFLY. You may be asked to provide a paper or electronic copy of your test results to airline personnel at the airport.

After a six-hour layover at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the second leg of my journey home from Mexico was canceled with no other options to fly that evening. Should you be one of the many unlucky travelers whose flights into the United States are canceled and rescheduled for the next day, you will need to be retested to meet the CDC requirement. Should you be one of the even unluckier travelers to test positive abroad, you won’t be allowed to fly back until you’ve completely recovered from the illness.

International travel declined by around 90 percent after the pandemic hit — but those still crossing borders may have begun to encounter a novel concept: “covid-19 passports,” or a mobile platform that proves a traveler meets a country’s requirements, such as a negative coronavirus test or, in a few cases, having received the coronavirus vaccine.

Also called health passports, these are not official documents granted by governments; rather, they are digital passes issued by apps, and accepted by some companies and countries, which have arisen to meet demands by airlines and governments that travelers have a negative coronavirus status. Instead of showing paper-based proof of a test or vaccination card at an airport — which could either be forged, lost or arbitrarily rejected without a streamlined process — a traveler would be able to store and certify their information via their phone.

Increasing the ease of travel is essential to boosting economies. These platforms, however, also give rise to privacy and equity concerns — such as how to ensure personal data is protected and how to address the needs of billions of people without access to a digital device or digitized health care, yet alone the vaccine, if they seek to travel.

All of this is why, despite the hype, industry experts cautioned that paper trails showing test results and inoculation dates are not going away anytime soon.

Instead, the need now is to “augment paper to be more secure, more privacy-protecting and more verifiable,” said Dakota Gruener, executive director of ID2020, a U.S.-based organization that advocates for digital IDs and is crafting standards for covid-19 passports.

Similar concerns around privacy and equity loom large over plans by countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Israel to create their own similarly named covid-19 passports, which, along the lines of airlines, could be used to limit domestic access to public places based on testing or vaccination status.

Travel checklists

To work, digitized travel health passes need broad and standardized buy-in. They are not quite there yet.

A representative for the World Health Organization said the global health body is “currently exploring how the common vaccination record could be done electronically” and has set up a working group to discuss standards for inoculation certification. The representative added that the WHO opposes governments or travel companies imposing coronavirus vaccines as a requirement to entry “because the efficacy of vaccines in preventing transmission is not yet clear, and due to limited global vaccine supply.”

Many airlines, however, already rely on a database, called Timatic (Travel Information Manual Automatic), to verify pre-departure that a passenger meets travel requirements, such as having the right visa and a valid passport. These resources were developed in part because airlines can be fined by governments if they allow passengers onboard who do not comply with the destination country’s rules.

Nowadays, that has meant it is up to airlines to ensure that international travelers have valid coronavirus test results if a country requires it, as the United States began to do in January. Airlines probably will be tasked with enforcing future coronavirus vaccine requirements, too.

Inoculation as a condition for entering a country is not new. The Yellow Card, officially known as the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, is an internationally recognized paper record, designed by the WHO, of a traveler’s vaccines and booster shots. Many countries have relied on it to check that international visitors meet any individual vaccine requirements, such as inoculation against diseases such as yellow fever.

The physical Yellow Card is also notoriously easy to lose — and to fake. Similar concerns surround efforts to require that travelers have a recent negative coronavirus test or, in a few cases, proof that they have been vaccinated against it. With no standard clearinghouse, there’s little recourse for a country or company to determine whether paperwork is from a real and reputable source.

“The paper processes for vaccine certificates, which have existed for decades, really need to be moved into the digital universe,” said Perry Flint, head of corporate communications for the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

That’s where a handful of digital platforms come in. There’s Travel Pass, a mobile app to host and verify travel requirements such as testing, developed by the IATA, which also manages Timatic. The program is being used on a trial basis by select airlines, including flights from Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

Then there’s CommonPass, created by the nonprofit Commons Project, which uses a scannable QR code to hold a passenger’s test data or vaccine documentation, in addition to their travel plans. Some United and Cathay Pacific flights have been trying it out since September.

In the United Kingdom there’s Blok Pass, which is focused more broadly than just travel and aims to offer a platform for customers to securely share health information. IBM has been similarly developing its own product, using the company’s blockchain technology.

Turbulence ahead

Gruener of ID2020 said these technologies have the potential to revolutionize how IDs are digitized — and some crucial pitfalls to avoid.

Earlier this month, ID2020 launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a cross-sector initiative to create standards for a digital health pass system. “Without standards, we are going to end up with a whole host of apps and paper-based certificates being used,” which may cause further confusion for customers and companies, Gruener said.

Then there are the privacy concerns among some travelers, who may not want to provide personal health information to an app on their phone. Ed Rayner, commercial director at Blok BioScience, which runs Blok Pass, said apps were designed with these hesitations in mind.

Compared with coronavirus contact-tracing platforms, which in many countries never took off because of privacy fears, “vaccine passports are way easier,” Rayner said. “It’s on their phones, it’s sovereign. So you can show it when you want to show it. No one is watching what you do.”

For both apps and paper forms, Gruener said QR codes — a machine-scannable image unlocking access to stored information — are useful, as they can ensure that only specific information is shared per bar code.

But although an app user may want to ensure there’s a widely accepted paper form for health credentials in case their phone dies or is stolen, for travelers without access to adequate health care or smartphones, paper will remain the norm. An estimated 3.6 billion people globally cannot access the Internet, according to the World Health Organization, while over 1.1 billion people cannot officially prove their identity. And although vaccination programs are rolling ahead in many Western and wealthy countries, billions of people in developing countries are still far off from receiving their first shot, underscoring how testing will remain a crucial component.

For now, Rayner anticipated that covid-19 passports would be slowly rolled out and integrated alongside paper trails.

“I think the airlines will have to build this up bit by bit,” he said. “Get it being used, and then it will become the norm.”

Two travelers visiting Hawaii from Louisiana were arrested on Friday and accused of offering a Honolulu airport screener $3,000 to let them pass without quarantining or providing the negative coronavirus tests required for entry, officials say. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Johntrell White, 29, and Nadia Bailey, 28, were charged with bribery and flown back to the mainland. The two allegedly flew to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport without any coronavirus test results and told an airport screener not to alert officials in exchange for money.

White is accused of offering the screener $2,000 to avoid quarantine, and Bailey offered the same screener an additional $1,000, the Hawaii Attorney General’s Office and Department of Public Safety reported in a covid-19 update from the governor’s office.

“The screener alerted deputy sheriffs, who arrested them both for bribery. White and Bailey were booked and released and immediately flew back to the mainland,” the governor’s news update stated. “The attorney general’s investigation is continuing.”

Bribery is punishable in Hawaii by up to 15 years in prison and can be fined up to triple the bribe amount.

Hawaii’s “Safe Travels” program requires all visitors to present a negative coronavirus test done by a state-approved lab within 72 hours of travel.

Those who arrive with no test or a positive test are required to quarantine for 14 days. Travelers have been arrested in the past for breaking quarantine requirements on the island after arrival, and in December, two visitors from San Francisco who knew they had the coronavirus flew to Hawaii.

On the same day that Bailey and White were charged with bribery, officials say, a man visiting from Wisconsin was also arrested and accused of breaking quarantine after he arrived without a coronavirus test. The man, Anthony Johnson, 44, checked into a hotel that was not his designated quarantine facility and attempted to go swimming.

This Monday alone, Hawaii saw 11,591 passengers arrive from out of state. Officials say 6,870 of those arrivals were entering for a vacation; 1,484 were returning Hawaii residents.

You’ve heard the expression that the coverup is worse than the crime? Well, in the case of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), the opposite might be true. Cuomo is under bipartisan fire after an aide admitted that his administration deliberately delayed releasing information showing the true extent of covid-19 deaths in New York nursing homes, out of fears, according to the aide, that the information “was going to be used against us.”

Stonewalling the Justice Department is bad enough, but Cuomo did something even worse: His administration provided inaccurate data to public health officials in real time, at the beginning of the crisis, when government scientists were desperately trying to figure out how the virus was spreading, who was most vulnerable and how to stop it. Instead of meeting its obligation to provide accurate information, the Cuomo administration provided incomplete data about nursing home deaths apparently because he feared real data would hurt him politically. That is like providing false intelligence to battlefield commanders about the location of the enemy in a time of war.

On March 25, Cuomo’s health department ordered nursing homes to accept known or suspected covid-19 hospital patients, prohibiting facilities from requiring tests to see whether they were infectious. After a firestorm erupted, on May 3, his administration suddenly changed the way it reported nursing home covid deaths — releasing only the number of deaths that took place inside nursing homes, and not counting those who died after being taken to hospitals. According to a senior Justice Department official, the administration withheld data on private nursing home deaths in New York until the final days of the Trump administration. As a result, the federal government was given bad data about the spread of the pandemic in New York. An Associated Press investigation found that New York under-reported the number of hospital patients recovering from covid-19 who were sent to nursing homes by 40 percent. The real number was more than 9,000 — my mother among them. And the Cuomo administration reported only 8,500 nursing home deaths, when the real number was about 15,000 — an undercount of at least 43 percent.

This was more than just a coverup. It impeded our public health response. We now know that New York was the primary source of new infections across the United States. Genetic testing shows that the outbreak in New York was seeded by travelers from Europe, and that it was the New York variant — not the West Coast variant that arrived directly from China — that seeded the rest of the country. The New York Times reported last year that the New York variant was responsible for 70 percent of covid-19 cases in Texas, 78 percent of cases in Wisconsin, 80 percent in Alaska, 84 percent in Arizona and 100 percent in Louisiana. As Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, told the Times, “New York was the primary gateway for the rest of the country.”

Follow Marc A. Thiessen 's opinions Follow

So, understanding how the virus was spreading in New York was critical to stopping it nationwide. But Cuomo’s administration shared inaccurate data with health officials. And then when Justice Department investigators and state lawmakers began asking questions, New York delayed its answers. His administration “froze” (in the words of Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa) and withheld the real data. It was only a court order and the release of a report by the New York state attorney general that forced the governor to admit the true extent of the damage his policy did.

Meanwhile, he presented himself to the world as the hero of the covid story — even publishing a book sharing “Leadership Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The media played along, holding him up in contrast to President Donald Trump as an example of effective executive leadership in the face of a public health crisis. In November, he received an Emmy award in recognition of “his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of TV to inform and calm people around the world.” No, he used TV to lie to New Yorkers and the world — and his lies cost lives.

New York lawmakers are talking about revoking Cuomo’s pandemic emergency powers. That’s a start. But imagine if Trump had done what Cuomo did? We’d have a third impeachment on our hands. Cuomo’s actions certainly merit his removal from office — not just for the coverup, but for the actions he took that impeded our national response to the worst pandemic in American history.

It was mid-November when Gerard Tyler received the text message from his longtime friend, the music-loving former neighbor who would go to nightclubs with him almost every weekend in the early ’90s. “Hey...been in the hospital since Thursday,” his friend, Michael Campbell, 63, texted him. “I have coronavirus pray for me.”

Tyler, a 67-year-old D.C. resident, asked whether there was anything he could do. “You’re in my prayers,” he said. The next day, Tyler texted him again, asking how he was feeling. He got no answer.

Campbell, who had diabetes and had previously had a heart attack, died Nov. 23 of complications of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A devout Catholic, he spent decades working in a laboratory and was a beloved “uncle” to the children who grew up next door to him in a Southeast Washington apartment complex, said Roberta Stephanie Campbell, who considered herself his “niece.”

He was one of about a half-dozen of Tyler’s friends who have died with a novel coronavirus infection. Like Tyler, and like most of the loved ones Tyler has lost to the pandemic, Campbell also was a Black gay man, a member of two communities that face higher risks of becoming severely ill with the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A report the CDC released this month found that gay, lesbian and bisexual people in the United States have higher rates of self-reported underlying conditions associated with severe covid-19 outcomes, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, obesity, kidney disease and stroke, than heterosexual people. Within this community, Black and Hispanic people are particularly vulnerable, according to the report, which relied on 2017-2019 data from a collection of population health surveys called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

Gay, lesbian and bisexual people experience stigma and discrimination in their lives that “can increase vulnerabilities to illness and limit the means to achieving optimal health and well-being,” the authors wrote in the CDC report. Advocates say this is especially true for the transgender community, but the CDC report said the number of respondents identifying as transgender or nonbinary was too small for reliable estimates compared with the non-transgender population.

The report is the CDC’s first in-depth study focusing on the potential impact of the coronavirus on the LGBTQ population. But as the report’s authors point out, no one knows the true toll of the virus on that community — because the United States is not collecting the data necessary to study it.

Since the early days of the pandemic, LGBTQ advocates have urged health officials at the state and national levels to collect data about sexual orientation and gender identity as they track covid-19 cases. A few states and jurisdictions, including California, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, pledged to begin doing so. But nearly a year into the pandemic, little progress has been made in releasing this data publicly, doctors, advocates and lawmakers say.

“You don’t know what’s happening unless you’re measuring it,” said Sarah Henn, the chief health officer at Whitman-Walker Health in D.C. “If you can understand the disparities, you can work to address them.”

In December, a coalition of 125 groups, led in part by D.C.’s Whitman-Walker Institute, signed a letter calling on state health officers to create an inclusive plan to distribute the coronavirus vaccine and to build trust with LGBTQ communities that have long faced discrimination in health-care and barriers to obtaining care. The letter also urged officials to prioritize the collection of data on the spread of the coronavirus and the distribution of the vaccine in LGBTQ communities.

In D.C., health officials have not released data about coronavirus infection rates in the LGBTQ community.

In a statement, D.C. Health said that it has improved sexual orientation data for the past two to three months but that it is limited to the information collected during contact-tracing interviews. Analyses and data on sexual orientation may be released in the future, but data about the transgender population are “still not being reported consistently or in sufficient numbers to release,” D.C. Health said.

“We continue to work to improve data quality and training and hope to gather and report on improved gender identity information, when available,” the statement said.

In September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed into law a bill that, among its provisions, required health-care providers and laboratories to collect and report communicable-disease data together with patients’ gender identity and sexual orientation. But state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who introduced the bill, said the implementation of the law has been rocky. Even as certain coronavirus testing sites began collecting data on sexual orientation and gender identity, “it’s not running through the labs the way age and gender and race do,” Wiener said.

He sees this lack of data as part of the LGBTQ community’s long history of invisibility and attempts by the wider society to “pretend we don’t exist or to make us illegal or now, more recently, to acknowledge our existence but then say this is a very private, dirty matter.” He says many people still are reluctant to ask patients about their sexual orientation or gender identity.

“By not asking the question, we are erasing the LGBTQ community,” Wiener said.

But others say that even if health officials at coronavirus testing or vaccination sites ask people to check a box pertaining to their sexual orientation or gender identity, some members of the LGBTQ community may not be comfortable answering the question.

“I don’t see that happening at all, especially with the seniors,” said Olivia O’Neal, a facilitator in D.C. with Silver Circles, a program of peer-led support groups for LGBTQ people over 60 run by Iona Senior Services and Whitman-Walker Health.

O’Neal says some of the members of her support group are still “very guarded in terms of who they are.” Some of them are estranged from their families or have yet to come out to some of their relatives. Many remember the AIDS epidemic and the stigma associated with it, recollections that are close to mind for members of her group amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s just bringing up a whole bunch of unpleasant memories,” O’Neal said, “awful memories of having to see their partners and loved ones, friends, just dying at alarming rates.”

Advocates for LGBTQ data collection say no patients should be required to check a box identifying themselves as gay or transgender. But “the more people are routinely asked these questions, the more routine they’ll be,” said Brad Sears, the interim executive director of the Williams Institute, a research center on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy at the UCLA School of Law.

Sears said the CDC report was a positive step in acknowledging the health disparities that have long existed in the LGBTQ community, particularly for people of color.

A Williams Institute report released this month found that among people who have been tested for the coronavirus, 15 percent of LGBT people of color have tested positive, compared with 7 percent of White LGBT people. The report used data from a nationally representative sample of adults collected by Axios and Ipsos between August and December.

Disparities in infection rates and job losses compounded by a history of discrimination affect health outcomes for members of the LGBTQ community, Henn said. This discrimination has been associated with higher rates of tobacco and drug use, for example, as well as higher rates of lung and cardiovascular diseases and obesity.

“When someone picks up a cigarette or uses alcohol or uses food as a way to comfort themselves when they feel they aren’t accepted for who they are, that has health consequences,” Henn said.

Earline Budd, a longtime transgender advocate in D.C., sees these stressors every day in the lives of the young transgender women she supports through HIPS, a local group that provides support for sex workers, as well as syringe disposal and access, and HIV testing and treatment.

She has also seen these same challenges play out in her own health. Estranged by her family at 14, Budd spent years living on the street, using drugs. She has worked in local LGBTQ advocacy for decades, winning awards for her work to challenge systemic abuses against transgender people and sex workers. But the discrimination and violence she has faced over the years have taken a toll.

“Being transgender, number one, is not an easy lifestyle,” she said. “Even at 62 now, sometimes I find myself struggling, thinking about how can I help other girls. I get depressed, and then I eat.”

She is HIV positive and diabetic and has been diagnosed with chronic kidney failure, she said — all underlying conditions that place her at high risk of severe covid-19. But she continues to go to work every day, sitting in the HIPS office with a face mask and shield.

“It worries me every day,” she said.

As Alaska faces another summer without cruise ships, the state is removing a roadblock for travelers. Tourists are no longer required to have a negative coronavirus test to avoid quarantine under new guidelines that went into place Sunday. The state is still telling travelers they “should consider” taking a test within 72 hours of departure. People who test positive for the virus are not allowed to travel to the state.

“While Alaska resident and non-resident travelers will no longer be required to have pre-travel negative tests upon arrival, it is still considered one of the best mechanisms to track the virus and prevent community spread,” a statement from the governor’s office said. Airport testing options will remain in place.

Testing at airports is now free for all travelers. It was previously $250 for non-residents.

The change came as Alaska’s covid-19 disaster declaration expired. The state started offering the option of testing as an alternative to a 14-day quarantine in June.

“My administration will begin moving Alaska, its economy and our lives forward through this transition and recovery process,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement. “Make no mistake about it, the virus may be with us for some time. But the data shows that the worst is most likely behind us.”

Before the pandemic, Alaska expected 2.2 million people to visit in 2020. Of those, 1.4 million would have visited by cruise ship. But no large ships were able to come after most cruises were grounded, and other forms of travel were curtailed as well. Actual 2020 visitor numbers were not yet available.

After Canada said that it would ban cruise ships through early 2022, effectively putting an end to hopes for any kind of 2021 cruise season in Alaska, tourism-dependent businesses said they were hopeful that travelers would still come to the state by air.

“The current state health advisory provides pathways for people to travel responsibly and experience Alaska’s wide-open spaces,” Sarah Leonard, president and CEO of the Alaska Travel Industry Association, said in a statement. “It’s incredibly important to our member businesses and our tourism sector that we continue to reopen and welcome more out-of-state travelers this year.”

The association’s website notes that the former travel mandates and orders have become advisories, but it says travelers should still follow those processes and best practices.

“We strongly urge travelers to continue to get a COVID-19 test before they come to Alaska to help the state mitigate the transmission and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its variants,” Leonard said.

Serena S. Spudich is a professor of neurology and chief of the Neurological Infections and Global Neurology Division at Yale School of Medicine. David A. Hafler is a professor of neurology and immunobiology, chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Yale School of Medicine and a member of the National Academy of Medicine.

It is understandable that the world has focused so much attention on the high mortality of covid-19 in older populations. This has led to a more sanguine approach to precautions such as mask-wearing and social distancing among many who don’t consider themselves at high risk from the virus. Thankfully, most people who contract covid-19 do survive the acute illness.

But there might be consequences of infection that we did not originally predict. Many patients in our clinics complain months after recovering from the disease of difficulty with concentration, finding words and completing complicated tasks. Given that more than one hundred million people worldwide have been infected by the novel coronavirus, how the disease affects the brain might be the neurologic research question of our time.

Advertisement

As physicians specializing in infectious and immunologic diseases of the brain, we care for and study patients to understand the interplay of infections and the body’s immune response in altering function of the nervous system. We know from experience that viruses impact the brain in diverse ways. With some infections, there are only modest consequences with transient fatigue or headache; on the other extreme, some viruses can directly infect and destroy brain cells, causing lasting damage and resulting in permanent impairments.

In scrambling to address the many unknowns of how the virus may impact the brain, we rushed in March 2020 to create a specialty consultation service to advise on and learn from these patients. Among a panoply of different conditions, we saw patients who woke up too slowly after long stays in intensive care, who experienced new strokes and who suffered unbearable headaches. Many of these patients died from respiratory or circulatory failure. The majority survived.

The good news was that the severe confusion, headaches and other acute neurologic symptoms for most patients improved as they recovered in the hospital. But as the weeks wore on, we began to notice new syndromes, many of which seemed to persist or even emerge days or weeks after the illness. We learned of new headaches that wouldn’t go away and disturbing changes in sensation on the skin all over the body. Individuals with no prior mood problems reported severe depression or anxiety that interfered with sleep or even caused thoughts of suicide. Frustrated health-care providers and students found going back to their routines at work or school challenging due to difficulties with concentration and multitasking. Patients even presented to our emergency services with new psychoses that unexpectedly emerged, including paranoia, delusions and violent behavior.

These syndromes raise many questions: Might neurological symptoms result from a direct viral infection in the brain, or a heightened immune reaction that may in some cases lead to an unchecked, autoimmune response against cells in the brain? Our own studies and those of our colleagues around the world suggest the latter. Other symptoms might be due to an unmasking of underlying conditions triggered by exposure to the virus, such as migraine headaches or early-stage memory disorders. Finally, some symptoms might be due to or intensified by the trauma of covid-19, isolation and the stress of this tumultuous moment in history.

With all of these questions comes an imperative for research. We need large, systematic studies to characterize and determine the frequency of and risk factors for these symptoms, including in races and ethnicities that have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. Essential to these studies will be defining the biological underpinnings of these syndromes, to help develop targeted treatments.

It’s also clear that we must do everything we can — mask-wearing, physical distancing, vaccination — to prevent new infections, particularly with the expansion of more infectious variants. The demographics of patients we see in our clinic with post-covid-19 neurologic syndromes are worrisome: Many are young and otherwise healthy people. Early in the pandemic, we were concerned about long-term brain health in patients who had prolonged stays in intensive care, but in our experience, such symptoms occur even in patients who experienced mild disease and were never hospitalized. Death rates do not tell the full story; survival after covid-19 infection might not be completely straightforward.

We must harness all of the investigative tools and expertise that we have developed in infectious and autoimmune diseases of the nervous system to understand how the brain might be affected by this tiny pathogen. We call on the National Institutes of Health, research foundations and survivors of covid-19 to invest, partner and participate in solving this new biomedical mystery. And we call on the nation to halt the spread of this virus to prevent the low but real risk of lingering mental disorders.

2021-02-16 14:21:05+00:00,65,"I caught this virus before anyone had even died in Illinois. That was like a century ago, right? Now we’re talking about Year Two, vaccines, new variants, a new administration, but for me it’s still exactly the same. I’m always in this bed. I’m always in this room. I’ve been sick for the last 330 days. I force myself to keep track because otherwise time doesn’t move. I feel like I’m in jail and putting tally marks on the wall.

About this series Voices from the Pandemic is an oral history of covid-19 and those affected.



I used to go to sleep thinking: Tomorrow. Tomorrow I’ll start to feel better. I don’t really do that as much anymore. I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that this virus isn’t something I’m about to get over. This might be it. Maybe this is who I am.

I wake up every morning, and I brace myself. What’s it going to be today? I’m what they call a “long-hauler,” where covid takes over your body and won’t go away. Doctors think there might be tens of thousands of us, but nobody really knows. It’s a medical mystery. It’s like a random grab bag of symptoms. You reach in, and you never know what you’re going to get. How about some nausea and severe dizziness? Or would you prefer a migraine with a side of joint pain? Some issues are constant, like body aches and head-to-toe fatigue, but the weirder ones seem to randomly come and go: ringing ears, sore ribs, heart palpitations, ear popping, numbness in my fingers, excessive mouth watering, lightheadedness, brain fog. My memory loss is so bad sometimes that it’s like I have amnesia. The other day, I woke up and wanted to put on running clothes. In my head, I thought I was going for a jog and then heading in to work, but as soon as I stood up, my heart rate started spiking, and it was like: Oh yeah. I can’t even walk around the block by myself. I don’t have a job anymore. I’m on disability. What am I thinking?

A lot of times I hardly get out of bed. The day never starts or the night never ends. It’s a black hole. I wait for the hours to pass.

I’ve withdrawn from pretty much everyone. I get the feeling sometimes that people think I’m being dramatic. I can’t really explain what’s happening to me, and neither can doctors. Some of them want to put me on antidepressants or send me to counseling because medically, none of this makes sense. I’m barely 30. I just got married. Ten years ago, I was playing Division I college soccer, and now I can’t go to the grocery store unless I ride around in one of those scooters. It’s like: Really? Really? It seems pathetic to people. It seems pathetic to me.

Covid was barely on my radar when I first got sick in early March. Nobody wore masks. Chicago hadn’t locked down yet. I got a headache and a sore throat, but I tried to gut through it. I work in finance, and it’s that Wall Street culture of hand-to-hand combat. You’re either at work or you’re on your deathbed, and that suits me. I’m competitive. My husband jokes that I have that killer mentality. I don’t like to slow down. I practically go crazy waiting in line at Starbucks behind people who don’t know what to order. “Seriously? Let’s go! The menu is always the same!” I like a fast pace. I kept working the usual long hours until my fever spiked, and then my husband started having symptoms, too. I called the Northwestern University covid hotline. They told me to go to the ER, but the ER said they didn’t have any tests. They told me to assume that I had it. They gave me painkillers and sent me home.

It was rough for both my husband and me. We needed a steroid inhaler to help with our breathing. We ordered tons of Gatorade, and we didn’t leave the apartment for the first 20 days. We’d argue about who had to get out of bed to feed the dogs. But then after a few weeks, my husband started to feel better. He was going for runs again. He said: “Come on. At least come for a walk with me.” I tried. I tried to fake my way through. You get sick and you’re supposed to get better. That’s what happens. There was no other possibility in my mind. I went back to working remotely, but I couldn’t focus. I was so tired that I’d lie in bed and move my mouse so it looked like my computer screen was active. I’ve had concussions playing soccer, and it was that same kind of fogginess where your mind drifts off and you just stare at the wall. There was so much pressure in my head that it felt like I was hanging upside down. I was making a ton of silly mistakes in my job. Sometimes, when I would place large trades over the phone, I would forget what I was doing in the middle of the call. I’d mix up the day of the week. I was like: “Okay. Something’s seriously wrong. Why am I not getting better?”

I’ve seen more doctors these last six months than I did for the first 30 years of my life. There’s hardly anybody that specializes in these symptoms yet. I have to be my own advocate, and it’s exhausting. I do my own research in covid forums online. I think I might have something called dysautonomia, where your brain stops telling the body how to do normal functions, but only a few doctors study that, and the wait-list for an appointment is more than two years. I managed to get in to see an internist in Chicago, but he sent me back to the emergency room, so that didn’t help. I found a rheumatologist, and she referred me to another rheumatologist, who sent me to a specialist out of state, and then he referred me to a cardiologist instead. I’m going around in circles looking for any kind of answer, but mostly it seems like they’re guessing. I’ve been told I might have Lyme disease, or something called POTS syndrome, or chronic fatigue, or fibromyalgia, or anxiety and depression. I have this big pillbox now, and a lot of the medications are still experimental, so we have to pay for them out of pocket. I take two antidepressants, vitamin D and a whole bunch of other stuff. My husband keeps track of the medications because it’s too much for me. He worked a connection to get me in to see a neuro-infectious-disease doctor. He assessed me and gave me a cognitive test, which I failed. He said 10 percent of people who get covid might end up having long-lasting neurological effects from this virus. He said: “It might be years before we fully understand it.”

If nobody knows what’s wrong, how do I get better? My vitals are usually normal. My lung scans look fine. My bloodwork turns out to be okay.

It sounds crazy, right? Am I crazy? I definitely have that psychological battle where I start to doubt everything. Could it all be in my head? I’ll tell myself I need to try harder. I’ll force myself out of bed, but then I get in the shower and the hot water turns my hands purple. My heart rate spikes. I get so dizzy I have to sit down.

I need help with everything. I can’t really drive. My husband and I moved out to the suburbs to be near my parents, and I have this great support system, but honestly, I feel like a burden. My husband is the full-time worker, full-time caretaker, full-time housekeeper. He’s been amazing, but we’re supposed to be starting our lives together, and now he has a little walkie-talkie to remind me about my medicine. He checks on me every hour, and meanwhile, I’m like this helpless 10-year-old just lounging in bed. The boredom is constant. I play some video games. I look online at house decor. One doctor told me arts and crafts could be a good way to keep my hands active, so that’s how I got through the holidays. On Halloween, I sat in bed and decorated paper pumpkins. I drew little scarecrows and taped them up on the wall. “Good work, Kaitlin! You’re using your brain. You should be so proud!”

It’s guilt. It’s anger and self-loathing. I have therapy once a week, and it helps. We’ve talked a lot about acceptance. I’m trying to accept that I’m not going to wake up one day feeling all better. I’m trying to let go of my expectations, but there’s grief in that. It feels like surrender.

RIO DE JANEIRO — There it was, the word we'd feared for 10 months and done almost everything we could to avoid: ""Detected."" My wife's coronavirus test had just come back positive. Now there were calls to make and worries to consider. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight In the last year, as Brazil’s failure to control the coronavirus ruptured hospital systems and spawned the worst humanitarian disaster in the country’s history, I’d often wondered what would happen if Emily or I got sick. The fears would strike suddenly, after I’d interviewed someone mourning a loved one who’d died unable to get hospital treatment. Or when glancing at the increasingly alarming headlines in the local newspaper.

“More than 1,100 coronavirus patients are waiting for a hospital bed in Rio de Janeiro.”

“Deaths at home rising.”

“No end in sight.”

“Private medical system at 98 percent capacity in the ICU.”

Now it was here, in our house. Hoping to stave off the worst, but not sure how, we started making calls. We phoned a doctor in the United States. He said it was all but certain I’d also been infected, and counseled rest, isolation, hydration — and little else.

Then we started calling doctors in Brazil. They urged a far more urgent, aggressive approach.

“It’s important you get [to my clinic] so it can’t get worse,” one doctor pressured. In September, she’d prescribed a friend of mine — whose symptoms included headaches and loss of taste and smell — a litany of medications that he came to swear by. Chloroquine, an antimalarial. Ivermectin, a parasite medication used on livestock and dogs. Azithromycin, an antibiotic. Clexane, an anticoagulant. A corticosteroid.

“We need to start your treatment soon,” the doctor added in a follow-up message.

Anxious and unsure, we got the azithromycin and ivermectin and — bottoms up — tumbled onto a coronavirus treatment plan that has swept the country, despite scant scientific proof. The pill plan, adopted by officials all over Brazil, has sent millions scrambling to pharmacies and worked its way into federal government guidelines.

Officials call it “early treatment.” People in the streets have another name: the Covid Kit.

The coronavirus pandemic has been a time of uncertainty and “miracle cures” everywhere. But this has been particularly true in Latin America. In Bolivia, people have bought chlorine dioxide, a bleach used to disinfect swimming pools. In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has public hospitals requiring coronavirus patients to take interferon alfa-2b, a virus and cancer medication. Doctors across the region are finding it difficult to find patients who haven’t taken ivermectin.

But few have pushed the unproven and potentially harmful medications with the gusto, commitment and theatricality of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

The Post analyzed hundreds of videos and photos of the Brazilian president to retrace his steps in the two weeks before he tested positive for covid-19. (Video: Elyse Samuels, Sarah Cahlan/The Washington Post)

His pill of choice has long been — and still is — hydroxychloroquine. He touts it on social media. He praises it in comments to supporters. When Bolsonaro was infected in July, he claimed to have medicated himself with the antimalarial, then waved a box of it at emu-like birds on the presidential palace lawn in Brasília. At a presidential ceremony after he recovered, he brandished another box of the drug and called himself “Dr. Bolsonaro.”

“Early treatment saves lives,” declared Eduardo Pazuello, Bolsonaro’s third health minister since the onset of the pandemic.

I was skeptical at the time — and remained so when we were infected. But it’s difficult to overstate the emotional impact of contracting a virus that has killed millions of people and left millions more with long-term health repercussions. There’s fear and uncertainty, yes, but mostly an overwhelming sense of helplessness. Some doctors say all you can do is wait and see. But other doctors — and government officials — are saying you can do more.

Whom do you trust? What do you do?

We started reaching out to more doctors. Six in all. One said take the pills. Another said she had taken azithromycin herself. I came away thinking about the pharmacies I’d seen throughout Brazil. They are absolutely everywhere, sometimes three in a single block. According to the Federal Pharmacy Council, the country is known for one of the highest rates of pill consumption in the world, and people are quick to self-medicate. When in doubt, the logic seems to go, swallow a pill.

“The culture of overprescribing was already here,” said Alexandre Kalache, an epidemiologist I’ve interviewed frequently throughout the pandemic. “The doctor who doesn’t prescribe is a bad doctor.”

So when “Dr. Bolsonaro” wrote out his prescription, who were Brazilians to argue?

In the central city of Barra do Garças, officials made little care packages of azithromycin, ivermectin, chloroquine and the painkiller dipyrone for public distribution free of charge. Minas Gerais state secured nearly 380,000 chloroquine tablets to meet local demand. And Itajaí Mayor Volnei Morastoni, a physician, went even further. He urged not only the pills but also a “simple, rapid” application of ozone — administered with a rectal catheter.

“At least he’s doing something,” Débora Fonseca, who represents the local union of health professionals, said with a shrug. “He wouldn’t have been reelected in November if people hadn’t supported it.”

But whether the treatments have been effective is another question. The death rate in Itajaí has been nearly 60 percent higher than the Santa Catarina state average. The Amazonian city of Manaus, where federal and state officials have urged all sorts of pills, has again been devastated by the disease.

No pill has saved Brazil from burying more than 230,000 people, the second most in the world after the United States. The creator of the Covid Kit, a doctor in Mato Grosso state, died of covid-19 in September.

So before continuing our pill regimen, we wanted more advice. We messaged another doctor, João Pantoja, one of Rio’s leading pulmonologists, whose contact Emily had somehow acquired. He disabused us of the idea of taking the medication.

“I’m not a believer in any of those ‘miracle drugs’ to ward off worsening of covid-19,” he wrote to us. “Although I would love to have one that actually worked at my disposal.”

He became the physician on whom we relied most. But in a country and region where the coronavirus continues to rage, it’s unclear how many will listen to such advice. In recent weeks, people have reportedly started threatening doctors who won’t prescribe medications, no matter how ineffective. Long lines have formed at Manaus pharmacies to buy the medications.

In some ways, the myth of early treatment is a product of the coronavirus itself. People will believe a pill cured them — or a loved one — when, in reality, the vast majority of people who contract the virus recover without any medical intervention.

“When someone gets better, it was because of their treatment,” said Alberto Chebabo, vice president of the Brazilian Society of Infectology. “But when they get worse, it’s because the virus is just that strong.”

Emily and I were convinced. We stopped taking the pills. We instead focused on rest, liquids and bad television. Additional testing confirmed that I had also contracted the virus. But after a few weeks — and a disorienting loss of taste and smell — we were pretty much recovered. For all those worries over the hospital system, neither of us were ever near sick enough to consider going to one.

Was it the ivermectin? Almost certainly not. The U.S. National Institutes of Health said last month that it had found insufficient data to recommend it.

But the myth continues.

The other day, my father-in-law, who lives in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, sent us a viral image making the rounds in Latin America. It showed a fake beer bottle, emblazoned with a new marketing slogan: “Now with ivermectin.”

Hundreds of government health workers called on to help respond to the pandemic and potentially administer vaccines are still waiting for the opportunity to be vaccinated themselves, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Two months after federal officials authorized the first coronavirus vaccine for use, there is still no plan to allot vaccine supply to fully inoculate the commissioned corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, a 6,000-person force that has been deployed to care for coronavirus patients, set up vaccination sites and perform other health tasks on behalf of the federal government. Instead, members of the corps have been encouraged to visit military treatment facilities such as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — where some officers have been turned away, unable to convince staff they were eligible for the vaccine — or try to get shots in states where they’ve been deployed. The corps is a uniformed service of the government, just like the military, and health department leaders have said all of its members should be eligible for shots under the Pentagon’s vaccination priority list.

“It’s been very challenging for officers to get vaccinated,” said one senior officer who has yet to be vaccinated and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. The officer, who had heard similar concerns from at least eight other officers, including some who oversee large teams, estimated that more than half the corps had yet to be vaccinated.

“There has never been a clear plan for our commissioned officers,” the officer added. “The message is basically, ‘You’re part of the commissioned corps. Good luck, get it where you can get it.'""

President Biden on Feb. 11 announced that the U.S. will have enough vaccine doses available for 300 million Americans by the end of July. (Video: The Washington Post)

Members of the corps are scattered across all 50 states and around the world, ranging from working as front-line caregivers in Indian country, to serving as staff in federal agencies around D.C. Its officers have played a central role in the U.S. response to the pandemic from its earliest days, deploying on missions to help evacuate Americans from virus hot spots — sometimes at elevated risk to themselves — and setting up some of the first coronavirus test sites.

The Biden administration’s pandemic response plan, announced in January, repeatedly touts the corps as a key element in the president’s plan to ramp up vaccinations.

“The Administration will deploy thousands of federal staff, contractors and volunteers to support state and local vaccination efforts,” it states. “This includes utilizing the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to deliver direct clinical training and vaccination program development across the country.”

Health and Human Services Department officials did not respond to questions about how many members of the corps had been vaccinated. The corps has asked officers to self-report when they get inoculated, complicating leaders’ abilities to centrally plan how many of their officers are receiving shots, said two of the officials.

“Within days of taking office, Biden administration officials became aware of some of these problems and have spent the past couple weeks working to address these issues and ensure vaccine supply for the commissioned corps,” said an HHS official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss in-progress plans.

“The administration has secured additional doses directly for members of the commissioned corps — they will be directly administered in partnership with [the Defense Department] at Walter Reed in the coming days,"" the official added. ""We are actively working on further solutions for additional corps members across the country.”

The corps, which reports to the assistant secretary for health and the U.S. surgeon general, is under the direction of acting surgeon general Susan Orsega, who has been negotiating getting the corps its own supply of vaccine doses rather than having the group covered through the roughly 1 million doses allotted to the Defense Department, officials said. Department leaders last week determined the corps should seek out its own supply of vaccine doses instead of jockeying for a share of doses with the seven other uniformed services, such as the Army or Navy, said one official.

“We thank all of you who have wanted to get the coronavirus vaccine, but we recognize that you haven’t been able to get the vaccine through either your local health department, or your state or even the military treatment facility,” Orsega told corps members in a virtual town hall on Thursday. Audio from the town hall, which was convened to discuss the corps’ role in administering doses of the vaccines, was obtained by The Washington Post.

“Please know that the support is absolutely overwhelming from the department and the immediate office of the secretary” of HHS, Orsega added, thanking officers for sharing their challenges getting the shots. “We’ll be sure to share more information as it becomes available.”

Orsega on Friday afternoon also sent a staff-wide email with instructions on how corps members could get vaccinated, including a memo that she encouraged officers to present at military treatment facilities as proof that they are vaccine eligible. The email and memo, which were obtained by The Post, came several hours after The Post first asked HHS whether there was a plan to vaccinate the corps.

In her email, Orsega acknowledged that officers had raised concerns about receiving shots at military facilities, saying that corps leaders were working on “resolving these problems.” She also cautioned officers not to expect a quick fix. “We anticipate those officers who receive their health care in the private sector … may face even more challenges trying to get vaccinated until local jurisdictions ramp up their vaccination programs and the vaccine becomes available in retail pharmacies,” she wrote.

Orsega, a rear admiral in the Public Health Service corps, has been the corps’ operational leader since 2019. She assumed the role of acting surgeon general after President Biden asked Jerome M. Adams, a Trump appointee, to resign last month before his term expired in September. Vivek H. Murthy, who served as President Barack Obama’s surgeon general, is still waiting for Senate confirmation before resuming the post under Biden.

2021-02-13 07:56:42+00:00,32,"Sure, “the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world” if the choice is between a great love and fighting Nazis. But for most of us, pandemic restrictions shrunk the world down to a few little people. Under these circumstances and in celebration of Valentine’s Day, pop-culture love stories deserve credit for more than providing fizzy distractions. They’re a way of exploring the emotions and connections that are keeping us all sane — or driving us around the bend.

If romance is considered a women’s genre, that’s because women know that love has high stakes. The covid-19 pandemic upped the ante, stranding couples who could work from home in the house together for months at a time, exacerbating differing opinions about risk-taking. Meanwhile, parents have taken on additional roles as teachers and health advocates, burdens that often fall more heavily on women.

This fallout is very real, as are concerns about the logistics of escaping domestic violence and preventing child abuse. And yet, though survey data suggests that spouses who have suffered financially have experienced more stresses in their marriage, couples broadly say that the pandemic has made them appreciate their partners more, or even that they are more in love than they have ever been. Prolonged togetherness and the high-stakes nature of human interaction appear to have made many dating relationships more serious.

[Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic]

So what do the past year’s worth of fictional love stories have to say about building a strong relationship, even under duress?

By sheer coincidence, a number of intriguing romances star couples who feel trapped or isolated in some way. In the romantic comedy “Palm Springs,” the trap is a time loop. Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan’s novel “The Heir Affair” sticks its leads in a rigid, manipulative royal family. The Netflix drama “Malcolm & Marie” drops its audience into a brutal fight between a struggling couple. And Disney Plus has its latest hit in “WandaVision,” in which a heartbroken superheroine traps her lover in a recreation of classic sitcoms.

All those metaphors deliver the same message. Honesty is crucial. Candor is hard, even — and maybe especially — when you’re stuck in close proximity to someone for an extended period of time. But no resentment or grief can stay below the surface forever, especially without the respites of work and normal social lives. Whether you’re living the same day over and over again or confined to the same house — no matter how nice or literally palatial — proximity makes grievances harder to keep under wraps. But rather than treating forced togetherness as a death sentence for a relationship, these stories treat it as a catalyst for their characters to develop deeper understanding of each other and commit to stronger partnerships.

By contrast, Sofia Coppola’s movie “On the Rocks” and Netflix’s hit romantic period drama “Bridgerton” are cautions against inventing problems where none exist. Rather than simply talking to her husband, the lead character in “On the Rocks” becomes convinced that he is cheating on her, a worry her mercurial father encourages. And in “Bridgerton,” a duke traumatized by a wretched childhood goes through ridiculous contortions to avoid allowing himself to be happy.

There are plenty of reasons for American couples and families to be anxious and fearful right now — and to feel guilty about what happiness comes their way. But “Bridgerton,” in particular, is a light, lovely argument for the transformative power of joy. Certainly, it’s possible to be reckless in pursuit of pleasure during a pandemic or to mistake self-gratification for liberation. But fetishizing feelings of guilt and shame do nothing for anyone else, either.

And finally, radically, two of the more touching love stories of our covid year suggest that the greatest gesture of love can be to flexibility. In Darius Marder’s “Sound of Metal,” a heavy metal drummer and his girlfriend make remarkable sacrifices for each other; even though at the end of the movie, the pair are no longer together, their tenderness endures. And in “Sylvie’s Love,” a jazz saxophonist and an aspiring television producer build a life together that neither could have imagined when they first met.

Like the characters in “Sylvie’s Love,” who fall for each other against the backdrop of the changes wrought by the rise of television, the civil rights movement and shifting tastes in popular culture, our lives and loves are caught up in a particularly fraught historical moment. One way to understand what’s happening to us is to look to economics, sociology and epidemiology. But to survive the pandemic, we need love stories, too.

President Biden announced his choice for secretary of health and human services on Dec. 7. He named the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the same day. But he has said nothing about who will lead another critical health agency on the front lines of battling the coronavirus pandemic: the Food and Drug Administration.

The silence is causing some consternation among FDA veterans, as well as public health and pharmaceutical experts, who say the agency needs a permanent head as it grapples with life-or-death decisions about coronavirus vaccines and treatments, while doing its day job of regulating products that account for 20 cents of every consumer dollar. That job includes approving cancer drugs, warning consumers about contaminated ice cream, and overseeing treatments for rare diseases in animals and humans.

A permanent leader also would help rebuild the credibility and morale of an agency whose reputation was hurt by the Trump administration’s relentless pressure and bashing, health-care experts say.

“The sooner there is a nominee who gets through the process, the better for public health and the handling of the pandemic,” said Stephen Ostroff, who twice served as acting FDA commissioner. “There are decisions that are more challenging when you are in an acting role,” especially at the beginning of an administration.

The lack of a nominee has helped fuel an increasingly bitter battle between supporters of the two people most frequently mentioned for the post: longtime FDA drug regulator Janet Woodcock and Johns Hopkins health expert Josh Sharfstein, a former top FDA official and former top Maryland health official. Biden named Woodcock acting commissioner after Stephen Hahn, the Trump administration’s last commissioner, left in January.

On Thursday, the contest heated up when 95 cancer experts, including a doctor who treated the late Beau Biden, the president’s son, told President Biden in a letter that Woodcock was “uniquely qualified” to be commissioner and praised her for overseeing the approval of dozens of major breakthroughs in treatments for cancer and other diseases.

The letter came just weeks after anti-opioid advocates voiced opposition to Woodcock, saying she and the drug center she helmed had approved too many opioids over the past two decades. Separately, several well-known public health experts have endorsed Sharfstein, saying he would bring fresh leadership to the agency.

The stakes are high: The next commissioner, besides grappling with a deadly and evolving pandemic, will determine the direction of an agency that has struggled to find the right balance between maintaining stiff requirements for drugs and devices and pressing for the quickest and most efficient approvals of medical products.

In broad terms, Woodcock, 72, is known for her deep experience in drug regulation and safety, and for prizing innovation, including in clinical trials, and regulatory flexibility. Sharfstein, 51, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has wide experience in tobacco, food and opioid issues and was a proponent of greater transparency while at the FDA during the first Obama term.

Woodcock is often described as the more industry-friendly of the two, and someone with strong support among patient groups because of her determination to try new treatments for devastating and rare diseases. Sharfstein is favored by those who think the FDA should raise its drug-approval standards but is opposed by some patient advocates, including in the cancer community. That’s because he has talked about changing programs for expedited drug approvals — programs that some advocates say have benefited patients.

In an editorial Sharfstein wrote last year for the Journal of the American Medical Association, he said the FDA’s programs for expediting drug approval have created “a thicket of special programs, flexible review criteria, and generous incentives.” He called for changes to ensure that expedited drugs provide greater benefits to patients.

FDA observers say broad caricatures of Woodcock and Sharfstein don’t fully capture the experience and breadth of interests of two people who have spent decades working on some of the nation’s knottiest health issues.

“Both have dedicated their lives and careers to public health and public service,” said Jason Schwartz, an assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.

The situation was starkly different four years ago, he said, when President Donald Trump flirted with the idea of nominating a staunch libertarian as commissioner who believed the FDA should not review medical products for effectiveness — a cornerstone of the agency’s mission. “That would have blown up the FDA,” he added.

Woodcock and Sharfstein declined to comment for this article.

Past administrations have typically focused on the FDA job after deciding other higher-priority positions. Scott Gottlieb, the Trump administration’s first FDA commissioner, was nominated in March 2017 and sworn in that May. And unlike the CDC director, the head of the FDA must be confirmed by the Senate.

But the pandemic increases the urgency of installing a permanent commissioner, health experts say. Senior agency officials have expressed relief at the ascension of Woodcock, who is viewed as a stabilizing force; some prefer her to Sharfstein, who sometimes rubbed people at the agency the wrong way. “I can’t think of anybody” who would be better to run the agency right now, said Ostroff, the former acting commissioner. “She has vast experience, and she is not shy.”

Perhaps because of that, the Biden administration, which has a pressing to-do list, does not appear to be in a rush to nominate a permanent chief. Several people familiar with its thinking suggest that a nomination could come next month, after it deals with coronavirus relief legislation and the hoped-for confirmation of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Becerra has emerged as a target for Senate Republicans. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The pro-Woodcock letter sent to Biden on Thursday was signed by 95 cancer researchers and center directors, many of whom helped guide the “cancer moonshot” Biden created in the last year of the Obama administration. Signers included Nobel laureates James Allison of the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Phillip Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; immunotherapy pioneer Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania and pancreatic cancer specialist Elizabeth Jaffee of Johns Hopkins. W.K. Alfred Yung, a neuro-oncologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center who cared for Beau Biden after his brain cancer was diagnosed, also signed the letter.

The endorsement by cancer experts came after anti-opioid advocates expressed vehement opposition to Woodcock, who served for years as head of the agency’s drug center. The groups argued that Woodcock and her division were too permissive in approving opioid medications and did not rein in drugmakers that falsely claimed that narcotic painkillers were less addictive. Democratic Sens. Maggie Hassan (N.H.) and Edward J. Markey (Mass.) also have sharply criticized Woodcock on opioids.

Woodcock supporters say that the epidemic represented a catastrophic failure by many segments of society and that it is not fair to blame her. Former FDA commissioner Robert Califf, who was Woodcock’s boss during his tenure at the end of the Obama administration, said the FDA was “far from perfect.” But he said doctors who vastly overprescribed the painkillers and pharmaceutical companies that pushed the pills were in large part responsible.

Some Woodcock critics also say she has presided over the lowering of FDA standards — a point her supporters strenuously reject. Those critics point to her approval of a drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare genetic disease, over the vociferous opposition of a key agency reviewer and outside advisers. Although the approval was enormously popular among the parents of patients, it caused an uproar within the agency. Woodcock’s backers say she deserves credit for providing access to a drug for a devastating, terminal illness.

Sharfstein supporters point to his broad experience in public health and say that he would give more weight to issues such as tobacco and vaping and food safety. Besides being at the FDA, he also was Maryland’s health secretary and Baltimore’s health commissioner. He won praise for his overall performance but was criticized when the state’s health insurance exchange had severe problems during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act in 2013.

Social factors also are at the heart of any pandemic response, particularly before the development of a vaccine. Adhering to coronavirus countermeasures — using masks, getting tested and maintaining social distance — are as much a reflection of concern for others as they are of self-preservation.

It stands to reason, then, that stronger, more connected and more trusting communities would have more success weathering the pandemic. This is the idea motivating the recent paper by Christos Makridis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cary Wu of York University in Toronto. Their work assesses whether the level of social capital in a community predicts the severity of the pandemic there.

Social capital refers to “features of social organization, such as networks, norms, and trust, that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit,” as defined by legendary political scientist Robert Putnam. In communities with large reserves of social capital, people trust their institutions and their neighbors. They belong to civic organizations such as churches, Elks clubs and bowling leagues. They help each other in times of crisis.

For their paper, Makridis and Wu used a social capital index previously developed by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. That index combines dozens of individual data points — including family structure, parental behaviors, social ties, political engagement, trust in institutions, crime and charitable giving — to assess social capital at the county level.

The committee’s report identifies two U.S. regions where social capital is high: what it calls the “mid-continent North,” stretching roughly from Utah to the upper Midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and the northern New England states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

One defining feature of all 12 states in these regions: They’re sparsely populated, home to just 9 percent of the U.S. population. Surveys have shown that people living in rural communities are generally more trusting of their friends and neighbors than people elsewhere, which can help build strong social networks. Some scholars who study social capital contend that in sparsely populated rural communities, “collective behavior is essential to provide basic services, like volunteer fire departments, that are provided by government in urban areas.”

On the other hand, the southern half of the country performs particularly poorly on the committee’s index. New York also stands out for low levels of social capital relative to its neighbors.

Makridis and Wu compared the committee’s social capital index score with county-level data on coronavirus infections, case growth and mortality. They controlled for a number of other factors that could plausibly influence severity, including population density, age, education and poverty.

Advertisement

“We find that moving a county from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths,” they write.

They found, moreover, that the relationship between social capital and covid-19 severity persists even when factoring alternative measures of social capital, including one that uses census response rates as a proxy.

Advertisement

Makridis and Wu also broke down the committee’s social capital index to determine which element is most closely related to covid-19 severity. They found that “greater trust and relationships within a community” were some of the most powerful predictors of virus spread. “When individuals have a greater concern for others, they are more willing to follow hygienic practices and social distancing.”

Conversely, in places with low social capital, people tend to be distrustful of the government, making them less likely to comply with social distancing and mask mandates. This can create a type of vicious cycle, Makridis and Wu write: Lack of compliance with public health directives leads to more severe outbreaks, which causes trust in government to erode further.

Other data, like the ongoing pandemic behavior survey conducted by Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi Group, shows that vaccine hesitancy is high in states with low social capital, particularly in the South.

While the data analyzed only goes through July, Makridis said in an interview that he and Wu don’t expect the relationship to change much over time. “When there are surges, that seems to be when social capital matters the most,” he said. “At the peak of the crisis in April, that’s when we found the greatest effect of social capital on the virus.”

Makridis and Wu’s research underscores how the ongoing erosion of social trust in the United States created an ideal environment for a pandemic to flourish.

With coronavirus vaccination efforts mounting in many parts of the world, some travelers may be looking forward to their inoculation in hopes of traveling again. And while there are growing arguments against vaccine passports, some nations have begun allowing vaccinated travelers to bypass the usual entry requirements, such as a 14-day quarantine.

European nations and remote tropical islands are among the destinations welcoming vaccinated travelers, even though health experts remain uncertain about coronavirus vaccines’ ability to prevent transmission of the virus.

Most vaccines “have not proven that they decrease transmission, so the patient may still get mild or asymptomatic versions of the disease and they may then be able to transmit it,” said Carlos Acuna-Villaorduna, an infectious-disease physician at Boston Medical Center. “We don’t know yet, but there are groups studying that.”

Advertisement

The risk associated with allowing vaccinated travelers, for now, is that they might carry a contagious amount of the virus without being sick — and could infect unvaccinated people in the destination they are visiting. Perhaps for that reason, some nations allowing vaccinated visitors are still requiring coronavirus tests before arrival.

Here are the destinations that have so far announced that they will allow vaccinated travelers to enter, and what the terms of entry are.

Greece

Greece reopened to Americans on April 19. Visitors must provide a vaccination certificate or proof of a negative PCR test within 72 hours of traveling. Tourists might have to undergo random health screenings, including covid-19 tests.

A broader reopening of the country is expected in mid-May.

Belize

The Central American country on the Caribbean Sea has been open to all travelers, but tourists have had to show proof of a negative covid test. As of Feb. 28, visitors can provide proof of immunization instead. “Belize will accept an official vaccine card reflecting the receipt of the dual or single dose vaccine at least two weeks prior to arrival,” the country’s tourism board says.

Visitors are allowed to move about the country freely, but the tourism board recommends they stay within the “Tourism Safe Corridor” where businesses, attractions, accommodations and tour operators have enhanced health and safety protocols in place. There is a curfew daily from 10 p.m. until 4:59 a.m.

The Seychelles

The islands of the Seychelles are now allowing “all visitors from any part of the world who have been vaccinated” to enter the country without quarantining. The Seychelles’ list of permitted countries for incoming travel no longer applies to those who are fully vaccinated at least two weeks before their arrival.

However, vaccinated visitors will still be required to supply a negative coronavirus test result in the form of a PCR test taken less than 72 hours before travel. Those vaccinated, tested visitors are “allowed free movement throughout their stay in Seychelles,” the islands’ tourism board said in a statement.

Georgia

The non-E.U. nation of Georgia reopened to travelers who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. It will not require testing or prevent those from high-risk nations from entering.

“Citizens of all countries, traveling by air from any country may enter Georgia if they present the document confirming the full course (two doses) of any COVID-19 vaccination at the border checkpoints of Georgia,” the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

Estonia

The government of Estonia, which does not permit U.S.-based travelers because of E.U. entry restrictions, recently announced it will now allow individuals from lower-risk countries who have recovered from the coronavirus or have received an approved coronavirus vaccine, both in the last six months, to visit without quarantining. Proof of previously testing positive for the coronavirus or a vaccination certificate in English, Russian or Estonian will be accepted for entry.

Romania

The E.U. nation of Romania, which does not permit Americans to enter, lifted quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers on Jan. 18, according to U.K. officials. Travelers from permitted countries such as England will be allowed entry without testing or quarantine after 10 days from their final dose of the vaccine.

Iceland

As of March 18, “everyone who can provide proof of a certified vaccination” or prior infection will be allowed to visit Iceland without having to quarantine or test, according to a recent government announcement. That includes citizens of the U.S. and United Kingdom.

Advertisement

Previously, the country had only announced that those who were citizens of European Union or European Economic Area countries were exempt from border restrictions, if they were vaccinated or previously infected. Vaccines must be certified by the World Health Organization or European Medical Agency.

Cyprus

The island of Cyprus, which is considered European territory by the European Union and is not allowing U.S. travelers to enter, has also announced that starting in March, it will welcome vaccinated travelers who are permitted to visit Europe.

Poland

The government of Poland, which is also subject to E.U. rules denying Americans entry until further notice, allows travelers from European Union nations to enter with proof of vaccination.

“Persons who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 are exempted from the obligatory quarantine (on the basis of a certificate confirming vaccination against COVID-19),” Poland’s entry rules state. The permissions for vaccinated travelers have been in place since Dec. 28.

Federal employees who exhaust their sick leave for reasons related to the coronavirus pandemic could receive additional paid leave if those problems continue to prevent them from working, under a bill to be considered in a House committee on Friday. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Employees who meet certain eligibility criteria could receive as much as 600 hours — 15 work weeks — of extra leave time to be paid from a $570 million fund that the bill would create. The fund would apply to all agencies, including the semi-corporate U.S. Postal Service, and would operate through Sept. 30.

Under the proposal, federal employees would have to use up their regular sick leave before drawing from the fund. Full-time workers accrue 13 sick leave days per year with no limit on carrying unused leave year to year. Part-time workers get proportionate amounts of sick leave and would be eligible for a proportionate additional amount from the fund.

The additional leave would be available to those who are “unable to work” because they are subject to a quarantine order or have been medically advised to self-quarantine; or are experiencing symptoms of covid-19, the disease the coronavirus causes, and are seeking a medical diagnosis; or are getting vaccinated or recovering from side effects of a vaccination.

It further would apply to those unable to work because they are caring for a family member who is in quarantine under an order or medical advice; or one who has a disability or is age 65 or older and incapable of self-care, if the regular source of care is unavailable because of the pandemic; or for a child whose regular day care is unavailable or whose school is less than fully open.

The provision is among those to be considered by the House Oversight and Reform Committee as part of an economic stimulus and pandemic response bill being drafted this week for planned voting in the House in upcoming weeks. The committee’s portion also includes $350 billion for state and local governments and $117 million for oversight of that spending.

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the subcommittee on government operations, said some federal employees already have exhausted their paid sick leave because of the pandemic.

“We get information about people who are really struggling because they had serious bouts of covid-19 or someone in the family has. . . . You can be out of work for months, and then you could have lingering effects,” he said in a phone interview.

“There are all kinds of lingering effects that may require time off. Maybe not the full 15 weeks that we address in this bill, but this pandemic may require chunks of time that sick leave simply doesn’t cover,” he said.

Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the ranking Republican on the committee, though, said in a statement that it is “unfair to the American people to provide an additional 600 hours of paid leave on top of regular paid leave to federal workers who already enjoy many work perks. The Democrats’ priorities are incredibly distorted given that many small businesses are struggling and millions of Americans are unemployed.”

The proposal is the latest of a recent series of bids to enhance federal employee leave benefits, both directly related to the pandemic and not.

Democratic leaders of the committee recently introduced a bill to substitute paid leave for unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act for federal employees needing time off for personal or family medical reasons. That would expand an existing policy allowing them to use paid time rather than unpaid for parental purposes under the FMLA law. The limit of 12 weeks within any 12-month period would remain, with use of paid time for one reason reducing how much could be used for another.

Also, a group of Democrats representing Washington-area districts recently asked the Office of Personnel Management to allow federal employees paid time off for getting vaccinated.

A French nun who survived both world wars, the 1918 flu pandemic and a coronavirus infection is marking her 117th birthday with red wine, a Mass in her honor and dinner followed by her favorite dessert: baked Alaska. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Sister André, who is believed to be the second-oldest person in the world, is set to spend Thursday celebrating her long life at her care home in the French city of Toulon. The facility’s spokesman, David Tavella, told the Associated Press that the nun was “in great shape” and “really happy,” ahead of a busy schedule that would feature a video call with her family, a service hosted by the bishop of Toulon and a champagne birthday feast.

“It’s a big day,” Tavella said, adding that there would be a cake for Sister André — although it wouldn’t be big enough to hold 117 candles.

“Even if we made big cakes, I’m not sure that she would have enough breath to blow them all out,” he said.

Tavella said the menu would include foie gras, capon with fragrant mushrooms and some alcohol to toast the occasion.

“All of it washed down with red wine, because she drinks red wine. It’s one of her secrets of longevity. And a bit of Champagne with dessert, because 117 years have to be toasted,” he said to the AP.

In the weeks leading up to her 117th birthday, Sister André spent her days isolated in her room at the Sainte Catherine Labouré retirement home in the southern French city of Toulon. The nun was one of dozens of residents at the home who tested positive for the coronavirus.

But on Tuesday, Sister André was declared recovered from the virus, a spokesman from her retirement home told Reuters, allowing her to hold on to her title as the oldest living European, according to Gerontology Research Group’s “World Supercentenarian Rankings List.”

“We consider her to be cured. She is very calm and she is looking forward to celebrating her 117th birthday on Thursday,” Tavella told Reuters earlier this week.

Ten others at the retirement home died of covid-19, Le Parisien reported, after 81 of the 88 residents tested positive in January. There have been more than 3.4 million cases in France and more than 80,000 deaths, according to The Washington Post’s covid tracker.

Sister André, originally named Lucile Randon, was born on Feb. 11, 1904, in Alès, a town in the Occitanie region of southern France. She grew up in a nonreligious Protestant family and worked at a young age as a governess in Marseille and a tutor in Paris, according to Le Parisien.

She converted to Catholicism at 19, and at 25, she began working at a hospital. For 28 years she took care of elderly people and orphaned children. In 1944, she joined the Daughters of Charity to become a nun at the age of 40. She took on the name Sister André in honor of her deceased brother, and in 2009, she moved to the retirement home, Le Parisien reported.

When Sister André turned 115, Pope Francis sent her a personal letter and a blessed rosary, according to FAMVIN, a religious news service.

After her diagnosis with the coronavirus in mid-January, Sister André was asymptomatic. Blind and in a wheelchair, the retired nun who lived through the 1918 flu pandemic and both world wars told France’s BFM TV that she wasn’t scared when she tested positive because she is not afraid to die.

“I’m happy to be with you, but I would wish to be somewhere else — join my big brother and my grandfather and my grandmother,” she said, according to a Reuters translation of that TV interview.

Tavella told Var-Matin newspaper that the nun was more upset about a disruption in her routine than in her health.

“She wanted to know, for example, if the meal and bed times were going to change,” Tavella said. “She showed no fear of the illness. In fact, she was more worried about the other residents.”

While in isolation, Sister André spent most of her time praying, she told Le Parisien, and longing for the days when she could have meals with friends and go on walks in the garden.

Tavella told the newspaper that the nun is very sociable and enjoys listening to music.

As for her 117th birthday on Thursday, Tavella told Reuters the gathering will be small given the risks of the coronavirus.

“She’s been very lucky,” Tavella said.

When President Biden met on Friday morning in the Oval Office with House Democratic leaders and committee chairs working on his covid-19 rescue plan, Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), who leads the Appropriations Committee, noticed that he and Vice President Harris were seated under a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight She reminded the president that FDR’s most ambitious domestic initiative, the creation of the Social Security system, assured that 90 percent of senior citizens would not have to end their lives in poverty.

DeLauro told Biden that he has the opportunity to do almost as much for the nation’s children by lifting nearly half of the those who currently live in poverty with “the stroke of a pen.”

It is a disgrace that the United States has a child poverty rate that is among the highest in the world — a problem that had been trending down in recent years but is once again growing worse with economic devastation wreaked by the pandemic. The coronavirus “did not just shine a light on child poverty, which has existed for generations, but it has exacerbated it,” DeLauro said.

Where the construction of a massive bureaucracy was required to achieve Roosevelt’s goal of nearly eliminating poverty among the elderly, the lives of millions of children could be transformed within the existing tax code, through the expansion of the child tax credit.

Follow Karen Tumulty 's opinions Follow

As it is now structured, the child tax credit is only partially refundable, which means that the poorest families — which include one-third of all children in this country — do not make enough to receive its full $2,000 annual benefit for each child under age 17.

Since 2003, DeLauro has been fighting to expand the size of the benefit. She has proposed providing $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those between 6 and 17.

Her bill, the American Family Act, would also make it fully available to families who currently don’t make enough to qualify. The benefit would begin to phase out for single parents earning more than $75,000 a year and couples who make more than $150,000.

Advertisement

In the Senate, a similar measure has been championed for a decade by Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).

It would be expensive, with the price tag estimated at $120 billion this year. But child poverty is even more so. A 2019 report by the National Academies of Science estimated that it costs the nation between $800 billion and $1.1 trillion annually in lost adult productivity, crime and health consequences to those who grow up in poor households.

During his presidential campaign, Biden promised to push for the American Family Act if he were elected. But as he and his staff were beginning to put together their pandemic rescue package, it was not initially clear that they planned to include it. DeLauro and her Senate counterparts were relentless in trying to ensure that their proposal, in some form, would made it into the massive $1.9 trillion plan.

Bennet noted wryly that they were helped by the fact that the woman who is now the nation’s vice president had been among the earliest co-sponsors of the legislation when she was a California senator. “My sense is that this is a central part of the package for them,” he said.

But the Biden stimulus package would expand the benefit only temporarily, for a year. On Monday, senior House Democrats announced a push to make the more generous tax credit permanent. They would also structure it as a monthly payment, rather than an annual one, which would allow families to more easily budget around it.

Democrats are not the only ones who believe that this is the moment to take bold action against one of America’s most serious problems. Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) surprised many by putting forward a proposal that would provide even more generous benefits for families with children younger than 6.

Advertisement

However, Romney would accomplish it differently, through the Social Security Administration rather than the Internal Revenue Service. He also would offset the costs by scaling back existing welfare programs and ending Americans’ ability to deduct up to $10,000 of state and local taxes against their federal obligations.

This could be the beginning of a long-overdue reckoning.

Our country should be doing at least as good a job providing for its children as other industrialized ones do. FDR showed us how to make sure that older Americans live decently at the end of their lives; it is at least as important to make sure that those who will carry on after them are taken care of as well.

Rep. Ron Wright (R-Tex.), who had received cancer treatment for years, died Sunday after being hospitalized with covid-19. He was 67. “His wife Susan was by his side and he is now in the presence of their Lord and Savior,” a statement from his office said. “Over the past few years, Congressman Wright had kept a rigorous work schedule on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and at home in Texas’ Congressional District 6 while being treated for cancer. For the previous two weeks, Ron and Susan had been admitted to Baylor Hospital in Dallas after contracting COVID-19.”

Wright had announced Jan. 21 that he tested positive for the coronavirus “after coming in contact with an individual with the virus last week.” He is the first sitting member of Congress to die after battling covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

“As friends, family, and many of his constituents will know, Ron maintained his quick wit and optimism until the very end. Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice,” his office said.

The House held a moment of silence to remember Wright on Monday after convening for a brief pro forma session.

Wright was reelected to a second term in November. His death will create the fifth special House election of the year so far; campaigning is already underway for three seats vacated or soon to be vacated by Democrats who are joining the Biden administration, and in the 5th District of Louisiana, where Republican Luke Letlow died before taking office.

Letlow, a 41-year-old congressman-elect from Louisiana, died after contracting covid-19 late last year, days before he was scheduled to be sworn in as a member of Congress.

The race to fill Wright’s vacancy could unfold quickly. Texas law requires special elections to be held 36 to 50 days after the governor orders them. Candidates who file at least 5,000 petition signatures compete in one election, regardless of party; if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers head to a runoff, regardless of party.

The 6th Congressional District of Texas, south of Dallas, which Wright has represented since 2019, has moved toward Democrats since it was drawn 10 years ago. In 2012, Barack Obama lost the district by 17 points; last year, as Democrats invested more in suburban Texas races, Joe Biden lost in the district by just three points. Wright ran ahead of the president, defeating a Democratic opponent by nine points.

Wright’s office said he will be “remembered as a constitutional conservative. He was a statesman, not an ideologue.”

In a statement, President Biden and first lady Jill Biden said they were saddened to learn of Wright’s death and called him “a fighter who battled bravely against both cancer and COVID-19, diseases that our nation will continue working tirelessly every day to defeat in the memory of all those we have lost. Our prayers are with Ron’s wife, Susan, their three children, and their nine grandchildren.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called him a “fighter who passionately served his constituents.”

“I was honored to have met Ron before he was a member and saw firsthand how he served his community,” McCarthy said in a statement, adding: “He emulated the very best of America, and we were fortunate to have had the opportunity to call him a colleague and a friend.”

National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said in a statement that Wright was a “dedicated public servant who devoted his life to bettering his community.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement that as lawmakers grieve Wright’s death, “Members of Congress are united in sorrow and pray for the families and loved ones of the over 460,000 Americans who have been killed by the vicious coronavirus. Each death is a tragedy that breaks our hearts and demands strong, urgent action.”

“May it be a comfort to Congressman Wright’s wife Susan, their children Rachel, Derek and Justin, and their nine grandchildren, and the entire Wright family that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time,” Pelosi added.

Nikki Stamp is a heart and lung surgeon in Perth, Australia. Government officials from Western Australia announced on Sunday that millions of people in the southwest part of our state would plunge into a strict, five-day lockdown after the first case of community transmission in 10 months was detected in a hotel quarantine security guard. The guard had unfortunately contracted the new strain of the coronavirus first identified in Britain.

It may seem strange to act so aggressively for a single case, but we Australians complied. There were no complaints of infringing on freedoms. No marches against masks. My city of Perth came to a standstill. The roads were quiet, and our beaches were deserted. A trip to the supermarket for essential groceries saw everyone wearing a mask — for the first time. Other states restricted travel of West Australians, desperate to keep the virus out.

Advertisement

The subsequent two days didn’t bring a rush of cases that we feared; instead, for the first two days of lockdown, no new cases of covid-19 were detected. Residents of other countries might think this was overkill; in truth, that’s how a proper pandemic response should look.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Australia has had fewer than 30,000 cases of covid-19 in total, a quarter of the cases the United States experiences each day. In Perth, we have had 904 cases for the entire pandemic, the vast majority in returned travelers from overseas.

As a consequence, our hospitals are operating as normal, not running out of oxygen like we’ve seen in Britain, or hospital beds as in the United States. Our mortuaries are not overflowing, and the great majority of doctors like myself have never even seen a case of covid, let alone cared for hundreds or more like our overseas counterparts.

Advertisement

Our low case numbers of covid-19 have meant that West Australians have not been subjected to the same restrictions around the world after a nationwide lockdown first gained control in March 2020. We don’t wear masks, and we have been able to enjoy relatively mundane things such as keeping restaurants and bars full of patrons. Our sports teams have continued to play to crowds of tens of thousands of spectators. Our beaches have been as busy as ever, and we’ve shaken hands and hugged our friends. Holidays such as Christmas went ahead as if nothing were amiss, without the threat of mass infections to follow.

The reasons we were able to get to this point have been largely due to decisive political leadership, leveraging our isolation and strict rules. Our international borders remain closed, with entry into Australia restricted to citizens and permanent residents who must complete a compulsory two-week hotel quarantine with regular testing for the deadly virus. We have also closed or controlled state borders, which have offered protection from localized outbreaks in the rest of the country.

Australians have largely supported and adopted a ""go hard, go early” approach. Early on in 2020, we cried to politicians to lock us down not only to flatten the curve, but to crush it. Melbourne residents endured a long and harsh lockdown in 2020 after a local outbreak saw cases increase, knowing that they could avoid disaster in doing so.

Whether you’re impressed by the swift actions or concerned at their severity, it’s hard to argue with how well they have worked. That’s especially true when you contrast these actions here, or in other successful nations such as New Zealand, with the devastating inaction around the world that has cost many lives and inflicted incalculable damage to economies, social structures and mental health. It may be too late to go early, but it isn’t too late for the rest of the world to go hard.

Here in Perth, annihilating the chance of any transmission means that we can quickly return to the lifestyle we hold so dear and, most importantly, continue to protect our citizens from a pandemic. We welcome the short-term pain for what we know will be long-term gain; hopefully, others around the world will do the same.

A police officer in central Florida was fired last fall after allegedly hugging a colleague against her will while mocking her fear of contracting the coronavirus — an example of how some have socially weaponized the deadly pathogen. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Longwood Police Department investigators also determined that Cpl. David Hernandez was “not fully forthcoming and not truthful” about the allegations after his co-worker filed a complaint about the July incident, according to internal investigative documents obtained through a public records request.

Hernandez ignored his co-worker’s instructions not to touch her, according to the investigative reports first obtained by the Orlando Sentinel. Instead, he followed her into her workspace while “taunting her with comments about her being afraid of contracting COVID-19,” which was surging in Florida at the time. The employee also alleged that she hurt her finger and back while struggling to escape from Hernandez.

In a letter to the discipline review board, Hernandez said he told the woman that he “couldn’t believe she was such a germaphobe” and that in an attempt to make her laugh, he waved his hands above her personal items and talked into her phone while saying he didn’t have the coronavirus. He also denied touching her after she said she didn’t want to hug, although he wrote that he raised his arm as if to put it on her shoulder.

Hernandez and a union officer whom the Sentinel reported represented him did not respond Saturday to messages seeking comment.

Firing an officer accused of mocking someone’s coronavirus concerns appears uncommon. Throughout the pandemic, officers have often been on the other side of citizens’ threats to infect them with the virus, forcing prosecutors to wrestle with whether intentionally coughing on a law enforcement officer is a crime.

People have also weaponized the coronavirus in stores by licking or coughing on products, sometimes leading to criminal charges. In one case, a man accused of licking deodorant in a Missouri Walmart was charged with making a terrorist threat in the second degree, a felony.

But the Longwood officer’s firing may have been based more on the alleged physical aggression than on the other employee’s fear of contracting the virus, said Arnold Zack, a former president of the National Academy of Arbitrators who teaches labor law at Harvard University. He said the fact that the alleged aggressor is male and the other employee is female also suggests that concern over sexual harassment factored into the termination.

“I don’t think the charges are separable,” Zack said in an email. “The covid component strengthens the unwanted aggression to even more dangerous consequences because of covid-19.”

Longwood Police Chief David Dowda emphasized the allegations that Hernandez, a member of the department since 2005, had violated his co-worker’s physical boundaries in his review of the situation, the Sentinel reported.

The woman “told you not to touch her and physically backed away from you and crossed her arms,” Dowda wrote. “This was more than sufficient indication for you to know to stop trying to embrace her.”

Dowda, who did not reply to an email Saturday, wrote that Hernandez gave investigators “inaccurate and conflicting information” several times and withheld relevant facts.

In addition to violating department policies on safety, harassment and conduct, Hernandez’s actions also met the requirements for a criminal battery charge, Dowda wrote. He noted that the force did not conduct a criminal investigation because the female employee did not want to press charges.

Hernandez is entitled to an arbitration hearing in which he can contest his termination, the investigative documents say.

Now that entry into the United States requires a negative coronavirus test result taken within 72 hours, travelers have been scrambling to secure coronavirus tests abroad — with many opting for speedier, though less-accurate, rapid tests. And most travelers probably do so under the assumption that their test will come back negative, allowing them to board their flight home without issue.

But what if that test comes back positive?

Even if you have been cautious throughout your trip, doctors say it is worth considering that your test result could be positive — effectively stranding you abroad for anywhere from days to weeks, until you can acquire a negative test result.

Here’s how to ensure you have a backup plan in place for a potential quarantine if you test positive for the coronavirus abroad, and what experts say you should keep in mind about rapid tests.

Officials say you could get stuck abroad

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department officials have said in recent weeks that those attempting to board flights into the United States without a negative test result in hand will be denied. That includes Americans who “could be stuck in an extended way” overseas if they test positive, says Martin Cetron, the CDC’s global migration and quarantine director.

Those who test positive for the coronavirus abroad are not permitted to travel back to the United States until they test negative within 72 hours of a secured commercial flight home. Depending on the country they are in, testing and/or another flight could be difficult to secure.

The State Department has also said it will not be offering medical assistance to Americans who test positive or require a coronavirus test abroad because of the department’s “limited medical resources” outside the country. That means that Americans who become sick or stranded outside of the United States should not rely on a nearby U.S. Embassy to assist them. The most the State Department offers is a directory of places where you can acquire a test, which can be found on the embassy website for the country a traveler is visiting.

Rapid tests are easier to find, but how accurate are they?

Considering those logistical challenges and the narrow 72-hour window of time allowed for a pre-departure test to be acquired, the United States is allowing rapid antigen tests, which are less accurate, for entry. Experts say that while the bigger problem with rapid tests are false negatives returned from asymptomatic people, some rapid tests return a number of false positive results to healthy individuals.

Shira Doron, an infectious-disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, says new at-home tests in the United States are more accurate than early iterations — but they do still see a single-digit percentage of false positives.

“Even if you’re talking about half a percent [resulting in false positives], apply that over the thousands of travelers per day and that’s a lot of people,” Doron says. “And there are rapid tests with false positive rates even higher, about five percent. That’s a lot of people every day getting kept out of the country, and to me it just says ‘stay home.’”

Even if you suspect your positive is false, you will be denied boarding and required to quarantine as usual.

The advantage of rapid antigen tests are first and foremost their speed. Rapid tests are “fast, cheaper and require far less resources than lab-based PCR tests, which take several hours to process,” says Tony Lemmo, CEO of BioDot, a manufacturing company that produces rapid testing materials.

While accuracy varies between different brands of rapid tests, Lemmo says false positives can occur and that positive rapid test results should be confirmed by a PCR test when symptoms are not present.

How to prepare for a positive result before you travel

Travel agents are advising people to plan for a positive test before they depart by purchasing third-party travel insurance that can cover the costs associated with 14 days in quarantine and/or additional testing.

Christine Sikes, an executive vice president for travel agent service Direct Travel, recommends talking to a travel insurance provider about which policies may be sufficient for covering expenses associated with quarantining, meals and potential medical expenses. Policy costs for those plans will depend on the purchaser’s age, travel destination and desired inclusions, Sikes says.

Travel agents are also advising travelers to pick a hotel that covers some or all costs associated with 14 days in quarantine for guests who test positive, which could be thousands of dollars for just the hotel stay. Hotel and resort chain Karisma, for example, is ensuring quarantine accommodations are free of charge at 17 of its properties for guests who test positive “until a doctor certifies clearance for travel with a negative test result for a period not to exceed 14 nights,” a Karisma spokesperson says. The offering is for all Karisma hotels in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

The free quarantine lodging appears to be popular with resorts in Mexico, where other properties including Marival Resorts and the Palmaia — House of Aia hotel are also offering complimentary stays of up to 14 nights for any covid-positive guests. In all of those quarantine programs, guests are not permitted to use hotel facilities outside of their room.

Sikes calls the free quarantine stays for coronavirus-positive guests “the exception and not the norm,” and she says that guests should know their hotel’s offerings and policies before they arrive. More often, hotels will discount a percentage of a quarantine stay offer on-site coronavirus testing for a fee — and PCR tests are more expensive. Conrad Hotels by Hilton, for example, charges $65 for a rapid coronavirus test and $185 for a PCR test.

“You can still travel safely. You just need to plan and know what the ramifications are if you test positive,” Sikes says. “Hopefully no one does, but if they do, then they must have a plan.”

A trial of an experimental coronavirus vaccine detected the most sobering signal yet that people who have recovered from infections are not completely protected against a variant that originated in South Africa and is spreading rapidly, preliminary data presented this week suggests. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The finding, though far from conclusive, has potential implications for how the pandemic will be brought under control, underscoring the critical role of vaccination, including for people who have already recovered from infections. Reaching herd immunity — the threshold when enough people achieve protection and the virus can’t seed new outbreaks — will depend on a mass vaccination campaign that has been constrained by limited supply.

Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that it appears a vaccine is better than natural infection in protecting people, calling it “a big, strong plug to get vaccinated” and a reality check for people who may have assumed that because they have already been infected, they are immune.

As new variants of coronavirus continue to be discovered, here's what you need to know about how these mutations work and how they spread. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Brian Monroe/The Washington Post)

In the placebo group of the trial for Novavax’s vaccine, people with prior coronavirus infections appeared just as likely to get sick as people without them, meaning they weren’t fully protected against the B.1.351 variant that has swiftly become dominant in South Africa. The variant has been detected only a handful of times in the United States, including a case reported Friday in Virginia, which became the third state to identify the presence of the virus variant.

The preliminary finding from the South African vaccine trial, based on a data set with limitations, stirred debate and concern among researchers as results first hinted at in a news release last week were revealed more broadly this week.

“The data really are quite suggestive: The level of immunity that you get from natural infection — either the degree of immunity, the intensity of the immunity or the breadth of immunity — is obviously not enough to protect against infection with the mutant,” Fauci said.

Even if they don’t agree on the scope of the threat, scientists said reinfection with new variants is clearly a risk that needs to be explored more. There is no evidence that second cases are more severe or deadly, and a world in which people may have imperfect protection against new versions of the virus is not necessarily a world in which the pandemic never ends.

“I worry especially that some of these premature sweeping conclusions being made could rob people of hope,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security. “I worry the message they may receive is that we’re never going to be rid of this. When in fact that’s not what the data suggests.”

She and others emphasized the apparent lack of severe health repercussions from reinfection — and the lack of evidence that reinfection is common.

When Maryland biotechnology company Novavax first disclosed results from two international vaccine trials last week, the company noted in its news release that some people in the trial with earlier infections had become reinfected, probably with the variant B.1.351, which had become dominant during the trial.

On Tuesday, details of the Novavax trial were presented at the New York Academy of Sciences.

About 30 percent of the people in the South African trial had antibodies in their blood at the start of the trial showing they had recovered from an earlier infection.

But that previous exposure didn’t necessarily appear to afford protection. Among those who got saltwater shots, the people with a prior infection got sick at the same rate as study participants who had not been previously infected — a surprise because they would have been expected to have some immunity. Nearly 4 percent of people who had a previous infection were reinfected, an almost identical rate to those with no history of infection.

“It’s awful strong data,” said Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who is co-leading the federal clinical trial network testing coronavirus vaccines in the United States. “Basically, it’s saying vaccination actually needs to be better than natural immunity. But vaccination is better than natural immunity.”

The study found that two shots of the experimental vaccine did provide protection against the variant.

The reinfection result was incidental to the main objective of the study, which was to determine the vaccine’s efficacy and safety. It was not designed to test the likelihood of reinfection, and others argued that it can’t be used to draw firm conclusions and cautioned against assuming that the previous infection provided no protection.

It also shows the risks of a strategy to reach herd immunity pushed by Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and adviser to President Donald Trump, who is said to have endorsed allowing the virus to spread mostly unfettered, while protecting nursing homes and other vulnerable populations. Atlas has repeatedly denied backing such a strategy.

The study backs up recent laboratory data from South African researchers analyzing blood plasma from recovered patients. Nearly half of the plasma samples had no detectable ability to block the variant from infecting cells in a laboratory dish. In a separate study, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York took blood plasma from people who had been vaccinated and found that vaccine-generated antibodies were largely able to block mutations found on the B.1.351 variant.

Novavax did not provide a breakdown of mild, moderate and severe cases, but severe cases of covid-19 were rare in the trial, suggesting that reinfection is unlikely to send people to the hospital.

“It is not surprising to see reinfection in individuals who are convalescent. And it would not be surprising to see infection in people who are vaccinated, especially a few months out from vaccine,” said Michel Nussenzweig, head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology at Rockefeller University. “The key is not whether people get reinfected, it’s whether they get sick enough to be hospitalized.”

Reinfection has always been a possibility, but scientists who design disease models had assumed that natural infection would convey some level of immunity for at least a few months. That figured into some earlier calculations for how America could start approaching herd immunity by this summer or fall. Even with limited vaccination supply and delays in distribution, the hope was that people previously infected would factor in the drive toward herd immunity.

If it turns out that previously infected people could be susceptible to reinfection by variants, that could have implications for when the nation reaches herd immunity.

“Everyone’s still trying to digest this and asking, is this really what’s happening? Because the implications are pretty huge,” said Chris Murray, who leads the modeling team at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “If the data holds true, it means we will need to walk the public back on the idea of how close we are to the finish line for ending this pandemic.”

Others are less sure. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, said he couldn’t draw clear conclusions from the data because it remains limited and preliminary.

“The pace has been dizzying, and several times today, I have learned new things that significantly change my view of those data,” Lipsitch said.

Projections created by data scientist Youyang Gu — whose pandemic models have been cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — suggest that about 65 percent of America’s population will reach immunity by June 1. But built into that 65 percent is roughly 20 percent having immunity from past infections only. Scientists are unsure how the potential for reinfection might influence their projections. They are eager to see if other vaccine trial data in coming weeks will corroborate the trend from the Novavax trial.

“The sample size so far is small,” Gu said. “We need much more data before we can draw conclusions.”

More data from South Africa will help clarify how common reinfection is and whether it results in severe disease. Researchers are following up with certain groups, such as health-care workers, to quantify reinfection, said Anne von Gottberg, co-head of the Center for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis at South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases.

“Several individual cases of reinfection have been confirmed,” Gottberg said in an email. “We may be able to learn from seasonal coronaviruses and the fact that reinfection for these viruses are not uncommon, and start to occur 6 to 12 months after the previous infection.”

The good news is that vaccine trials from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax show that vaccines can work — even against the B.1.351 variant, and particularly in preventing severe illness.

“I think the fact that we … now have data from two vaccines indicating that we can prevent serious disease, even against the new variant, is hopeful,” Penny Moore, a scientist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, said in an email. “We need to keep monitoring sequences as these won’t be the last lineages.”

A future concern needing close monitoring is whether the reformulation of vaccines to keep up with the evolving virus could drive the virus to continue evolving. There is also a concern that subpar immunity could allow new resistant variants to emerge. That possibility, Nussenzweig said, is one reason that people should get both doses of a vaccine, on time.

Over four decades working as a civilian with the Montgomery County Police, Blanca Prudencio Kling was an advocate for crime victims and the voice and ears of the police within the county’s growing Latino community. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight A soft-spoken and petite woman, she assisted in crime-prevention efforts, went to the scenes of crimes and other tragedies and visited victims at home and in hospitals, offering comfort and help. She was instrumental in the police department’s efforts to gain trust in the immigrant community.

Kling, 68, died Jan. 27 at UM Laurel Medical Center of complications from covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. She lived in Prince George’s County with her husband of 40 years, Tony Kling.

“Her faith increased in times of tribulation or times of suffering. God always gave her strength,” said the couple’s son, Jason Kling, 37. “She was always able to take on the pain and suffering of others.”

Tips about unreported crimes against the undocumented community of Maryland would often land on Kling’s desk, and colleagues said she worked to follow up on them.

In 2010, she recruited a detective to investigate after a Hispanic man repeatedly found his car tires slashed in the Wheaton area. Kling and the detective went door to door and found more victims.

The investigation led to the arrest of a man who was ultimately convicted of a hate crime. Prosecutors at the time said there were more than 10 victims.

Helping others was in Kling’s nature, friends and family said. She began doing it while in grade school in her native Bolivia.

The youngest of four children of a military general in La Paz, she got in trouble for sneaking food and clothes from her home to give to less fortunate neighbors.

“My parents would buy cooking stuff, and it would be gone in a few days. They knew it was me,” Kling said in a 2004 story in the The Washington Post when she was honored in the Human Rights Hall of Fame.

“When I was 11, for six months I invited a homeless man for lunch every day at 2. I’d tell my grandmom, ‘He’s coming, so we have to feed him.’ My parents finally gave up trying to stop me from helping the poor,” she recalled.

Kling was 17 when she moved to Maryland, the first in her family to migrate to the United States. She attended Bethesda Chevy Chase High School and went on to study at Montgomery College.

In 1980, a decade after arriving in the United States, Kling joined the county police department as an aide and interpreter. She then became a victims services coordinator, a job that took her to crime scenes and victims’ homes.

“She took my sister and I along to meet these people she served, and she impressed upon us at a very early age the joy of serving others and the duty we have to advocate and fight for those without a voice,” said Jason Kling, a social worker at D.C. Public Schools.

“She showed clients love, and they responded to that,” he said.

Kling, who was known with affection as Blanquita, eventually became a familiar face in the homes of thousands of Hispanic families in the Washington region who watched her appear on local Spanish-language news or listened to her on the radio offering tips for how to stay safe on the road, warning about unscrupulous scammers and encouraging immigrants without documents to report crime.

She made deep connections with some families who experienced crime, including those who had lost loved ones to homicide.

In her latest role as the police liaison with the Hispanic community, she helped launch anti-gang programs at schools and street safety campaigns aimed at reducing pedestrian fatalities.

Over the span of her career, Kling connected Hispanic immigrants to housing opportunities and jobs and helped them navigate challenging bureaucratic processes. She helped organize health fairs, domestic violence summits and numerous other events, including an annual holiday party for autistic children.

“She would call me, and she’d be like, ‘We need $1,300 to put this together.’ And that was my job to go and get sponsors,” said Grace Rivera-Oven, a close friend who partnered with Kling on various community events.

Kling was one of the first county workers to arrive at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at a Silver Spring apartment complex in August 2016. The blast killed seven people, injured more than 30 and displaced more than 100 — most of them immigrants.

She led volunteers in distributing food and clothes to the displaced and helped set up a mobile clinic for injured residents who feared going to a hospital because of their lack of health insurance. She helped families organize funerals.

“She worked nonstop for three weeks. Day and night,” recalled Rivera-Oven, who also volunteered. After the emergency was over, Kling continued to work with families to help them find housing, school supplies for the children, and free mental health help.

“Blanquita always went the extra mile. She was not a 9-to-5 worker,” said Rivera-Oven, who knew Kling for more than three decades. “To Blanquita, this was a mission. It was not uncommon for her to be delivering food or taking someone to a doctor or a therapist.”

A devout Catholic, Kling was also dedicated to service through the church. In the early 2000s, she became the first Hispanic person, and woman, to chair St. Camillus Church’s Parish Council, and worked with the church-sponsored immigration programs, including helping new immigrants apply for amnesty in the 1980s.

The Rev. Brian Jordan of St. Camillus, in Silver Spring, said Kling “believed in the importance of justice” and in the power of charity and love.

“She showed it not just by her words but especially through her actions,” said Jordan, who met Kling 30 years ago and officiated at her Jan. 29 funeral. She was also full of energy, he said.

“I always saw Blanca as a model for that commercial [for] the Energizer bunny,” he said at the service. “¡Ay, Dios mío! — Oh Lord! — So much energy, and she didn’t even drink that much coffee. She was always so full of energy. Full of love and understanding.”

Those close to her said Kling’s faith kept her strong as she worked on many heartbreaking cases. She organized prayer chains for strangers and friends dealing with illness or loss.

At home, Kling took pride in guiding her two children in the Catholic faith, and in the spirit of helping others. Jason and Lizzie Kling, 34, learned to read and speak Spanish with their mom by reading verses of Jesus’ teachings in the Spanish version of the Bible.

Over the past year, she was overjoyed with being an abuela, said Jason Kling. He said he’ll treasure the limited time she spent with his 1-year-old twin boys, Noah and Matias.

She loved going to live performances at Strathmore with friends, took nieces and nephews to the movies, and was an honorary comadre — godmother for Bolivian folkloric dance groups.

She was “a pillar in the Latino community,” the police department said in a statement. Kling’s presence in front of television cameras and behind radio microphones helped “inform, forge authentic relationships and build bridges of collaboration between our Spanish-speaking constituents and our police force.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who in 2016 nominated Kling to a congressional victims’ rights award, said: “We will always remember her kindness, generosity, and unwavering commitment to Montgomery County and to all Marylanders.”

The news about Kling’s declining health in mid-January moved friends and family to launch nightly prayer chains just like she had done for many of them in the past. Acquaintances overwhelmed her Facebook page with messages, photos and stories about how she had helped or touched their lives.

On Jan. 29, county police escorted her remains from St. Camillus to George Washington Cemetery in Adelphi, where she was laid to rest.

Jason Kling said her death has left thousands who knew her brokenhearted. And many, he said, inspired to continue her work.

“We knew the science told us we couldn’t stop the virus. We could slow it down and protect people who might be vulnerable and make sure we had enough hospital capacity to take care of those who would need it. But that we were going to do it together and allow people to be flexible to take care of their families and still put food on the table. So that was a unique approach that for our people really worked well. We did have tragedies and we did have losses, but we also got through it better than virtually every other state.”

— South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R), in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News, Feb. 2

Noem has attracted significant attention for these remarks, made after she was questioned about a tough New York Times “opinion video” that, in the words of the Times, aimed to “unpack her deadly playbook for how to handle a pandemic all wrong while preserving a reputation for being credible and competent.”

The main point of contention is Noem’s statement that South Dakota “got through it better than virtually any other state.” As the Times video and our colleague Philip Bump recounted, the coronavirus numbers for South Dakota are pretty terrible.

“South Dakota ended 2020 with the second-highest number of population-adjusted coronavirus infections in the country,” Bump wrote. “One out of every 9 residents had contracted the virus, and 1 out of every 600 had died of it.” (By February, the numbers showed that 1 out of 8 residents had gotten the virus and 1 of 500 residents had died of it.)

In particular, South Dakota (along with North Dakota) surged near the top of the list after the transmission of the virus and preventive measures were better understood. In August, Noem encouraged attendance to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, where a gathering of nearly 500,000 people is believed to have led to a surge of infections across the Upper Midwest.

So this made us curious — what type of metrics is Noem using to make her claim? It turns out, it is not really about health outcomes. As a reader service, here’s what she is talking about.

The Facts

Ian Fury, the governor’s communications director, first directed us to Noem’s annual budget message, delivered in December. “The state hasn’t issued lockdowns or mandates,” Noem said. “We haven’t shut down businesses or closed churches. In fact, our state has never even defined what an ‘essential business’ is. That, quite simply, is not the government’s role.”

Instead, she argued, “even amid a pandemic, public policy ought to be holistic. Daily needs must still be met. People need to eat and keep a roof over their heads. And they still need purpose. That means policymakers cannot have tunnel vision. They must balance public health concerns with people’s mental and emotional needs, their economic livelihoods and social connections, and liberty, among many other important factors.”

In particular, Noem bragged that the state’s finances were solid, unlike other states that had instituted lockdowns and mask mandates.

Fury offered four metrics that he said Noem was referring to when she asserted South Dakota was getting through the pandemic better than virtually any other state. Only one is directly related to the pandemic.

Still, it’s striking that South Dakota, a relatively rural state, has death and illness rates that rival the numbers of much more densely populated states. According to a Washington Post tracker of deaths per 100,000 residents, South Dakota is the fifth worst state, with 207 reported deaths per 100,000, after New Jersey (245), New York (224), Massachusetts (216) and Rhode Island (209). The state ranks second, after North Dakota, in cases per 100,000 residents.

We shared charts with Fury that showed how poorly South Dakota fared on health-care metrics and asked whether Noem thought those results were troubling. “Governor Noem has said several times that even one death is too many,” Fury replied.

He suggested it was too early to make such comparisons between states. “It’s important to remember that America appears to be at the peak of a second wave of the pandemic. South Dakota was on the front end of this wave, peaking in November and steadily decreasing in spread of the virus since then,” Fury said. “On the other hand, the nation as a whole is peaking in deaths as we speak. From New York and Rhode Island in the Northeast to Arizona in the Southwest, cases and deaths are up in states nationwide. The only days in which deaths nationwide eclipsed 4,000 were all in January 2021, long after South Dakota’s pandemic spread had subsided. So an apples-to-apples comparison is difficult to do when other states are still on the upswing.”

In a report released Feb. 4, WalletHub rated South Dakota currently as the 16th safest state during the pandemic, based on an overall score that includes the vaccination rate, the positive testing rate, the hospitalization rate, the death rate and the estimated transmission rate. (North Dakota was rated the second safest state.)

The Bottom Line

In her remarks on Fox, Noem was relatively vague about what she was referring to when she claimed South Dakota did better than just about any other state. A reasonable person would assume she was talking about coronavirus cases and deaths — which would be false.

But Noem made her comment in the context of allowing people to “put food on the table.” Apparently, she views the crisis more through an economic lens — employment numbers, budget surplus, new residents — than a health lens. Only one of those metrics — the unemployment rate — puts South Dakota in first place, though it’s certainly in the top ranks in the other areas cited by her spokesman.

We will leave it to readers to judge whether her metrics are appropriate in a health emergency. Whether this approach works for her is open to question. An October report ranks her 45th in terms of popularity among governors for her handling of the pandemic, though her approval rating may have improved since then as the coronavirus cases in her state have come down.

There is some moderately good news recently in the fight against the coronavirus: The average number of new cases being recorded daily has dropped each day for the past three weeks. We are now recording an average of around 130,000 new cases each day, a figure that is more than 100,000 new cases lower than what we were seeing in mid-January but a figure higher than what was recorded at any point before Veterans Day last year.

New cases inexorably lead to new deaths, so the downward trend in new infections seems, at last, to be bringing down the number of people who succumb to covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. As of writing, the seven-day average of new deaths is a bit over 3,000, a figure that will likely increase as the day’s death toll is tallied. But, still, a downward turn.

Despite that, Thursday marked a milestone in the fight against the virus. At some point today, the country saw its 450,000th covid death. By now, 1 out of every 733 people alive last year has died of the disease.

The toll has been particularly horrific of late. It took more than 12 weeks between the first known infection from the virus last year and the 25,000th death. The most recent 25,000 deaths came over the past eight days — as did the 25,000 deaths that preceded them. The 25,000 deaths before that came more rapidly than at any other point in the pandemic: seven days from one milestone to the next.

On every day since Jan. 9, the average number of deaths from covid-19 has exceeded the death toll from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Every day, more than 3,000 deaths.

Another way to look at that: It has been nearly a month, 27 days, since the rate at which Americans were dying of covid was slower than one every 30 seconds.

That’s two deaths every minute. More, really, since the average after Wednesday had a death every 28 seconds. But no slower than every 30 seconds. Every day since early January.

Advertisement

Vaccines are being injected, and case numbers are coming down. There are more contagious variants out there, which experts fear will lead to a new surge in cases. But for now, things appear to be improving, and, it seems likely, the rate at which people are dying is slowing. Thursday may be the day in which the average rate at which those deaths occur finally gets back over the 30-second mark.

Let’s hope it does. Let’s hope the pace keeps slowing. Let’s hope it’s never again as bad as it recently was. Let’s hope it’s never again as bad as it is right this minute.

Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, was vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board under President Bill Clinton. R. Glenn Hubbard, a professor of economics and finance at Columbia University, was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight America faces a dire public health and economic emergency, yet the usual partisan lines are being drawn in Congress as the Democratic left and the Republican right gird for battle over President Biden’s coronavirus relief plan. These political partisans should be uniting to fight covid-19, not fighting each other.

One of us is a lifelong Democrat, the other a lifelong Republican. But we manage to agree on about 95 percent of economic issues. Couldn’t members of Congress manage to agree on, say, 75 percent? Republicans can support a large relief package without accepting every detail of the president’s plan. Democrats can give ground here and there without compromising the most important principles.

Advertisement

What are those principles? We would highlight three.

First, delay can be deadly. This is a national emergency and must be treated as such. That means agreeing on a big relief package quickly. Mass vaccination provides the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. But the tunnel is long, and we are now in a very dark place. Supplemental unemployment benefits agreed to in December will run out in March; the $600 checks will not last long. Yes, another relief package will add to the national debt, but so did World War II. Covid deaths already exceed all the U.S. deaths in that long and bloody war, and the body count keeps rising.

Second, aid should be targeted to the greatest needs. That means fighting the pandemic with vaccines, gloves, masks and help for opening schools safely. How can that be a partisan issue? Turning to economic assistance, the greatest needs are obvious: income for the poor and unemployed, food for the hungry, help for small businesses struggling to survive, and aid to states and cities and towns trying to maintain essential services.

Advertisement

The checks issued under last year’s Cares Act, and the $600 checks coming now, were not well-targeted. Many of the lowest-income households received nothing while funds went to households well above any reasonable definition of “middle class.” The assistance was not even targeted to people whose incomes were damaged by the pandemic. Washington can do much better.

Third, pandemic relief programs should be designed to phase out as the economy improves, not on set dates. Predicting the state of the economy six months or a year from now is a challenge even in normal times. With a pandemic raging, it’s next to impossible. Before the Thanksgiving-Christmas surge in covid cases, the U.S. economy appeared to be improving rapidly. But now, retail sales are falling, and jobs are disappearing. Who knows what the future will bring? The flow of relief should respond to sensible triggers that reflect the state of the economy.

Conservatives and progressives alike should be able to agree on these three simple principles: speed, targeting and timely phaseout. That will leave plenty for the two camps to fight about later in addressing deep structural problems relating to poverty, inadequate education, racial inequality and more. Congress should debate these issues vigorously, and there will doubtless be partisan differences. But first: Deal with the immediate threat.

Advertisement

That effort faces some major stumbling blocks.

One is the overall size of the president’s proposed $1.9 trillion relief package. Some conservatives say it would add too much to the deficit or stimulate the economy unduly; some progressives call it too small. Frankly, the two of us are not worried about the government providing substantial fiscal support, given the state of the economy. And with the Federal Reserve nearly out of ammunition, fiscal policy must take the lead. There are good reasons for running large deficits now — as long as the spending is well-targeted.

Another concern is liability protection for business owners who fear being sued if employees get sick with covid. But there is existing law around similar problems, and finding a middle ground shouldn’t be difficult. For example, safe harbors can be devised that protect responsible businesses without eliminating liability for gross negligence.

Advertisement

Some Republicans are wary of sending more federal assistance to state and local governments. But they, not the federal government, are on the front lines in the war against covid, waging expensive campaigns while wrestling with revenue shortfalls and balanced-budget requirements. One result is more than 1 million layoffs of state and local government workers — so far. Without federal aid, there will be many more layoffs, including of critically needed personnel. Another Republican concern is that states might use federal funds to replenish depleted state employee pension funds. We’re not political experts, but a governor who redirects money intended for a public health emergency isn’t likely to please voters.

The nation is suffering from two critical shortages: vaccines and political good will. Congress has the power to address both of them.

2021-01-28 02:58:07+00:00,49,"I’ve been so focused on helping to develop these vaccines that I barely thought about the mechanics of getting it myself until this month. How can our process be this complicated? I’ve been calling around now for the last several weeks. I could not find out where, or when, or how to receive a vaccine. I didn’t get anywhere.

About this series Voices from the Pandemic is an oral history of covid-19 and those affected.



I’m 88 years old. I’m in the priority group, and I qualify by all the Phase One recommendations. That should be enough. I don’t want to jump ahead of anyone in the line. I don’t want to call somebody up on the phone and say: “You know, I actually consulted on this vaccination process. I wrote the textbook on vaccines.”

If I’m not able to get in through the normal channels, that means a lot of people like me are not getting in, and that’s a big problem. We shouldn’t be experiencing this level of chaos in a developed country at a time like this. I live in a suburb of Doylestown, which is the county seat here in Bucks County, so it’s not like I’m way out in the hinterlands. I did research online and registered for all sorts of things with the state and county, and I never heard back. I called and called and couldn’t find a way to get vaccinated within 20 miles of my house. My wife got frustrated on my behalf and started searching outside the area, and just by chance a few days ago she found a hospital in a different town that had openings left for the Moderna vaccine. I’ve barely left home to get the newspaper, but I was lucky to find this vaccine anywhere. I realize a big part of the problem is the lack of supply, but millions of people are being left on their own to navigate this disorganized mess. It’s a free-for-all. What kind of system is that?

The whole experience of this pandemic has taken us through the emotional extremes. There’s my frustration with our national response, which has not been proportional to the threat of this virus. But I also try to focus my mind on the encouraging moments, and we’ve had many. Our vaccine development has been remarkable. There are many reasons for doom and gloom, but the science is sustaining.

Let’s not exaggerate my own role in all of this. I don’t have a laboratory anymore, so all I can do is consult. I’ve been offering my advice to the World Health Organization and the Gates Foundation. I serve on a board for Moderna and communicate with Oxford, Sanofi and Inovio. I helped create the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and it’s supporting the development of about eight vaccines, but I can’t take credit for what’s come down the line. I’ve been cheering from the sidelines and shouting out my suggestions. I’ve been incredibly busy without ever leaving my house.

What I’ve been focused on lately is advocating within these organizations for a change in our vaccination strategy, so we get one dose to as many people as possible over the next few months. I’ve looked over the data, and it suggests that you have pretty good immune protection starting 12 days after the first dose. Obviously, you need a second dose to get long-term protection, but the immune system stays primed for the second dose for at least six months. I’m suggesting we wait on the second dose for up to 12 weeks until our supply improves. Otherwise a lot more people are going to be calling around and striking out like I’ve been doing. It’s a controversial approach, but an extraordinary disease requires extraordinary solutions.

Stanley Plotkin, 88, sits for a portrait in his home in Doylestown, Pa., on Jan. 25. (Michelle Gustafson for The Washington Post)

Now, will anybody listen to me? I don’t know. One of the advantages of being older and somewhat respected is that people are polite about soliciting my advice, even if they don’t always take it. They value my experience. I cut my teeth on polio and anthrax in the 1950s. I developed the rubella vaccine that’s now in standard use throughout the world, and I’ve worked on vaccines for rotavirus, rabies, Lyme disease, and cytomegalovirus. When I first started, we only had two ways to develop a vaccine, and now we have many more methods that show incredible promise. More than 100 vaccines are being developed against this virus — all in record time. Science is cumulative. It builds steadily toward progress, and that’s been my answer to despair during this last year. I can look back over my life and see a degree of advancement that’s staggering.

We can say with justification that vaccines have changed the world, and that gives me hope that they can do so again. I had contracted three diseases by the time I was 10 years old that are now prevented by vaccine: pertussis, pneumococcal pneumonia and severe influenza. At that time, only a handful of vaccines were given to children. Now, at least 16 are on the routine schedule. Parents can expect their children to grow up, and that’s a relatively new thing. It shouldn’t be taken for granted. But because people now have the great luxury of forgetting about these diseases, we are starting to run into all kinds of strange conspiracy theories about vaccines. Some people revert back to the Dark Ages of mysticism and pseudoscience. The White House had that guy [Scott] Atlas. I mean, my God! The minimizing, the skepticism about masks — you couldn’t have made it up. Then there are people like Andrew Wakefield or Robert Kennedy, who have influence and use it to spout nonsense about vaccines, and that’s dangerous.

If I were president, every child in the country would be required to take a course in statistics. Opinions don’t count for all that much. Facts count, and we have a lot of data about the safety of vaccines. Nobody can say vaccines are 100 percent safe. There’s nothing that’s 100 percent safe. That’s ridiculous. But there is a system in place, called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, to financially compensate people for vaccine reactions, in which the evidence is presented to a panel that weighs the facts and then decides. It works out to be about one compensable reaction per every one million doses of any particular vaccine. So then you have to ask yourself: What is the risk of the disease at the moment? This virus is replicating. It is constantly making more of itself, and during that process there are always variations and mutations that occur. I don’t think there is any doubt that the risk of this disease is a hell of a lot bigger. Any reasonable person should accept vaccines on the basis of logic. Unfortunately, logic does not predominate around the world.

Organisms, viruses — they are not going away. They will continue to cause epidemics. This virus will likely persist in the form of sporadic cases and occasional outbreaks no matter how hard we try. What we may be looking to is an influenza-like situation, with a virus that mutates over time, and we will have to tweak the vaccine sporadically to meet those changes. I hope I’m wrong, but I’m not optimistic this virus will entirely disappear. We live in a world where you can wake up in Kampala and go to bed in New York. The spread of viruses through human agency is more likely now than ever.

It’s not an exaggeration to say our future depends on finding solutions. That’s why I wanted to work in a laboratory ever since I was about 15. It is tedious and uncertain work, but it has aspects of an almost religious experience. You are that explorer in unknown territory. I think back to a Tennyson poem, “Ulysses,” which I quoted long ago in my college yearbook: “To follow knowledge like a sinking star, beyond the outmost bounds of human thought.”

Say all you want about the horrors of this last year, but we have reached those outmost bounds. We have accomplished more than I would have imagined possible, and it’s been a global effort. It’s astounding. It’s thrilling. I was about to say it’s miraculous, but that’s not right. I don’t believe in miracles. It might sound a little fancy, but I believe in science. I believe in our capacity to endure and overcome.

More than 400,000 Americans are dead from covid-19 in the 11 months since the first confirmed U.S. fatality from the disease. Current models predict an additional 200,000 could be dead by late spring. Intensive care units nationwide are nearly 80 percent full. Vaccination is going far more slowly than necessary to keep up with the epidemic.

There have been no substantial advances with new antivirals, and remdesivir, a drug approved for use in hospitalized patients, has had only a modest effect in curbing bad outcomes. We are in desperate need of safe, oral medications to treat early cases of covid-19 to prevent hospitalization and death.

Unfortunately, the debacle with hydroxychloroquine in the summer, touted by the former charlatan in chief as a cure-all for SARS-CoV-2 infection, further poisoned the well of repurposing old and generally safe medications for treating the new disease.

But potentially reliable medications are available already — and it’s time to start trying to use them, even if that means loosening the standards for deciding whether a drug works to use off-label to treat the coronavirus.

Last week, the Montreal Heart Institute issued a news release sharing encouraging findings from a study of the anti-inflammatory medication colchicine in reducing covid-19-related hospitalizations or deaths. Colchicine is a an inexpensive and safe medication that had been on the World Health Organization list of essential medications for the treatment of gout until 2005, when it was replaced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen. While the news release suggested a 21 percent reduction in death or hospitalizations, the actual number of those events was very small (fewer than 10, total), resulting in findings that are statistically fragile.

In the United States, a randomized-controlled study, the type of study design believed to produce the highest, unbiased quality of evidence, demonstrated that the drug fluvoxamine, a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression more than 25 years ago, significantly reduced clinical deterioration — including preventing 100 percent of hospitalizations — in patients newly diagnosed with covid-19. An observational study just reported by its research sponsor last week, and conducted during a covid-19 outbreak among employees at a racetrack in California, replicated those findings — a 100 percent reduction in hospitalization or death — from six hospitalizations or death among untreated patients compared with none among fluvoxamine-treated patients.

At least 1,000 patients have died every day of covid-19 since mid-November. With the ongoing devastation and the burden on hospitals, families and medical personnel, what evidence is needed before we can conclude that the benefits of a medication outweigh its risks? How much certainty is needed if the alternative — no treatment — guarantees hospitalization in 10 to 20 percent of known cases and deaths in 2 percent?

The 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in December 2016, includes Section 3022, which requires such institutions as the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and NIH to consider “real world” evidence in assessing medications.

As I have learned and studied the mechanisms of fluvoxamine action in cellular, animal and clinical research studies, as an infectious-disease physician and public health expert, I have struggled with the questions of “how much evidence is enough” and what is “real world evidence.”

To further understand a way forward, last week, I invited a select group of clinical, pharmacology and statistical experts from academic, public health and U.S. governmental research institutions to review and discuss the data on fluvoxamine. I asked them to consider the question: In the absence of the most robust evidence, are we ready for a process sometimes called “shared-decision making” between a physician and patient? That would involve the physician providing the patient with the pros and cons of an intervention to enable the patient to make their own informed choice. In the case of fluvoxamine, there is a safe and promising oral medication that might prevent hospitalization and death. But it hasn’t yet passed the rigor of the highest bar of scientific evidence for efficacy — a large, rigorous randomized-controlled trial.

I was surprised to learn that among the 20 respondents, 11 supported “shared decision-making,” while only five opposed it and four neither opposed nor supported it. But perhaps that should be expected, given the increasing shift toward patient autonomy and the severity and extent of the epidemic.

So where does that leave us? From the physician perspective, with the overarching ethic for our profession being “Do no harm,” the use of a safe drug for 10 days is unlikely to be harmful for an individual and may have substantial benefit. The choice seems easy: Give it a try.

From the public health perspective, we might be recommending the use of a drug with no benefit to hundreds of thousands of scared individuals. It would be wasteful and misleading, at best, undermining the foundation of trust on which the field is built.

For me, personally, as one who is both an academic public health expert and physician, I am not ready to see fluvoxamine recommended in national treatment guidelines just yet. But I am ready to try it with individual patients who are at increased risk of bad outcomes. That’s the balance we’ll have to strike, one treatment at a time, as we try to find our way out of this pandemic.

When Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced on Sunday that he had tested positive for covid-19, he joined a long list of world leaders who fell ill after systematically downplaying the virus, a list that includes Britain’s Boris Johnson, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump. After initial reactions of concern — López Obrador is 67, has high blood pressure and suffered a stroke in 2013 — he is now facing scrutiny over his activities in the days leading up to the diagnosis.

Despite the country’s alarming coronavirus crisis — Mexico has now surpassed 150,000 deaths, although the number is likely twice as high — the 48 hours before the announcement saw López Obrador engaged in a flurry of activities in northern and central Mexico. This is not unusual for him. He has resisted calls to cancel such trips and often appears without a mask.

Last Friday, in Monterrey, López Obrador took a phone call from President Biden. In a photo shared by the president, none of those present for the call, including López Obrador and Marcelo Ebrard, his foreign minister, wore protective equipment or sat at a safe distance. Later that evening, 36 hours before his announcement, López Obrador joined Tatiana Clouthier, his economy minister, for dinner with high-profile business leaders. Health precautions were equally lax.

On Saturday, he met face to face with Clara Luz Flores, a candidate for governor in Nuevo León. Across a small table, López Obrador did not wear a mask. Later, he visited the state of San Luis Potosi for an event. Once again, he was the only one on the dais without a face mask. On Sunday, the same day he said he had tested positive, López Obrador joined the country’s top military brass for an event. He can be seen mingling, touching his nose and fist bumping a governor. He is, of course, not wearing a face mask.

López Obrador flew back from San Luis Potosi on a crowded commercial flight. A reporter recorded him walking down the aisle, taking a window seat. By then, he was wearing a mask. Twelve hours later, López Obrador would be quarantined, along with several members of his Cabinet, local officials and several of the people with whom he socialized.

López Obrador’s contagion should come as no surprise. “This is the story of an infection foretold,” Mexican epidemiologist Jaime Sepúlveda told me.

For months, the López Obrador administration has downplayed and even ridiculed the pandemic. For months, Hugo López-Gatell, Mexico’s controversial coronavirus czar and a López Obrador loyalist, refused to acknowledge the importance of face masks. López Obrador has spent most of the crisis flaunting his disdain for science, including protective equipment and even hand sanitizer. He has insisted Mexicans should carry on with their lives. “We should hug. Nothing’s going to happen,” he said in late March, a few days after insisting he was protected from the virus by religious stamps he carried in his wallet.

“His bad example and irresponsibility have had mortal consequences for Mexico,” Sepúlveda told me.

Mexico’s handling of the pandemic has been disastrous. According to medical expert Laurie Ann Ximénez-Fyvie, author of a scathing new book focused on López-Gatell’s dismal performance as head of the government’s coronavirus team, “The damage has been irreparable.” That might be an understatement.

On Monday, López Obrador’s symptoms remained mild. While the rest of the week will surely prove delicate, he will likely recover fully from the disease. Once that happens, Mexico’s president will face a reckoning and an opportunity. Like Johnson in Britain, he can choose to emerge a humbled man (Johnson was hospitalized and thanked the health workers who saved him and implored the British public to take the disease seriously). So has former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who survived his own bout with the disease and now urges Americans to wear face masks.

If López Obrador chooses to learn the virus’s painful lessons, he may yet save his country from a tragedy of historic proportions. Mexico still lacks a coherent vaccination plan. Over the next few months, the example of a chastened and prudent president could be invaluable.

Of course, there is also the possibility that López Obrador might choose poorly. This is, after all, an election year in Mexico. A political animal first and foremost, López Obrador could try to project a Trumpian aura of invincibility, a messianic macho, undaunted by the common enemy. It would be a grave mistake. If he fails to learn from the experience, Mexico’s president will have lost another historic opportunity to save lives.

I had a pretty low bar for any Democratic presidential candidate last year. Would the party nominate some sort of land-based mammal, preferably a biped? Could it be relied upon to put a fabric covering over the holes through which it breathed? Would it be likely to concede any election it lost, rather than assembling a mob of angry partisans and pointing them toward Congress?

Joe Biden easily met my requirements, which is why I voted for him. But now he needs to exceed my hopes, especially when it comes to the most important issue facing his administration — the pandemic.

Unfortunately, early on, Team Biden has not mustered truly presidential ambitions.

Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing really wrong with Biden’s covid-19 plan. I’m all for using the Defense Production Act to ensure that we have adequate supplies not just of the vaccines, but also of all the syringes, vials and other ancillary goods we’ll need to get those shots into arms. Vaccination centers and more testing are also great ideas. But without more ambitious targets and an aggressive implementation schedule, Biden’s plan is still basically replacement-level.

The administration began by touting its bold plan to get 100 million doses injected in its first 100 days. Which sounds magnificent, except that this broke down to 1 million shots a day, and America was already basically doing that. In the past week, Biden said he’d like to get to 1.5 million daily vaccinations (though White House press secretary Jen Psaki clarified that the official goal has not changed) while U.S. vaccinations already averaged 1.25 million shots a day, according to Bloomberg. No, the administration did not do anything meaningful to accelerate the pace during its first five days in office.

It did, however, spend quite a bit of time complaining about how hard it all was. Jeff Zients, the new coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters, “What we’re inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined.” CNN quoted an unnamed source from the administration saying, “There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch.”

Surely the system established under the Trump administration couldn’t be that bad if it was exceeding the Biden administration’s own initial targets. The United States has administered about one out of every three vaccine doses given in the whole world, according to Bloomberg’s tally, hardly a shabby record.

Follow Megan McArdle 's opinions Follow

Okay, Biden’s defenders might say, his administration is trying to work the refs and laying the groundwork to blame his predecessor for anything that goes wrong. But hey, the reason that’s so easy to do is President Donald Trump’s denialism and mismanagement, and isn’t it nice to finally hear nothing more worrying than normal political spin?

That might even be a defensible position, if it weren’t for the more contagious — and possibly more deadly — variants that have emerged in Britain, South Africa, Brazil and maybe even California.

As Noah Millman pointed out in the Week, our reason for worrying about these exercises in reputation management is the same as the administration’s reason for undertaking them: It takes pressure off them to do better.

If more contagious variants hadn’t emerged, maybe we could have afforded a Biden administration that was comfortably sure it was going to come out of this looking good.

But the new strains are here, and because they’re more contagious, the precautions we’ve been taking, which are currently pushing caseloads in the right direction, won’t necessarily be enough to keep them from seeding massive new outbreaks. That’s why Britain basically had to lock down the whole country to keep hospitals from collapsing.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the variant from Britain may be dominant here by March. The variant from South Africa could be even more problematic, given that recent research shows it might be able to reinfect people who have already had covid-19 but developed only low levels of antibodies. That could be a lot of people; almost half the samples the researchers tested didn’t neutralize the virus in their tests.

No need to panic: The vaccines we have are probably still effective enough to keep even the South African strain at bay. But they make vaccination even more urgent than it seemed during the election. And until we have a shot in a high-enough percentage of Americans’ arms, we must get serious about testing and quarantining every inbound international traveler — by putting them in a supervised facility, not by asking them to pretty please stay inside.

And so we have to demand that the Biden administration aim stronger, higher, faster. Now.

Understandably, the administration is reluctant to embrace the financial and political costs of setting more ambitious goals for pandemic control, and doing what it would take to meet them. But understanding is not the same as acceptance. We need the president to do more than not be Trump. We need him to lead.

On Sunday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler was walking outside a craft brewery on the Oregon city’s southwest side when a man walked up to him and shouted, “Thanks for ruining the city!” Moments later, the Democratic mayor blasted the man in the eyes with pepper spray. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “Oh my God!” the man cried in an audio recording of the encounter published by the Willamette Week. “Wow ... I can’t see. The mayor has just thrown something at me.”

The encounter between Wheeler and the unidentified man was recorded by former Portland mayor Sam Adams, who later told police that the man, who was unmasked, had accosted them on the street with a video camera.

Tim Becker, a spokesman for the mayor’s office, told The Washington Post in an email Monday that Wheeler is cooperating with police “and encourages others involved to do the same.” Adams declined to comment.

Over the past year, Wheeler has been highly criticized by protesters over his management of police amid last summer’s protest crackdowns. At one point, some urged him to resign for what they saw was an insufficient response to calls for police reform.

He’s also faced criticism for his early handling of the pandemic in the city. On Monday, the state’s department of health reported 291 new coronavirus cases and three deaths in Multnomah County, the city’s county seat.

Wheeler served as Oregon’s treasurer from 2010 until 2016, when he was first elected mayor of Portland. He was reelected for a second term in November.

On Sunday night, at about 8 p.m., Wheeler was leaving McMenamins Hillsdale Brewery & Public House after dining with Adams when a maskless, middle-aged White man suddenly approached, the mayor later told the Oregon police department.

The man, who told Wheeler he had taken pictures of him at the pub, accused the mayor of disregarding coronavirus safety measures during his meeting with Adams, Wheeler wrote in an emailed statement to police.

“He accused me of sitting in a restaurant without a mask,” Wheeler said. ""I informed him the current covid regulations allow people to take their mask off for the purpose of eating and drinking.”

The man then followed him to his car while recording with his phone, Wheeler said, and refused to back away despite Wheeler’s multiple requests. He was within two feet of the mayor’s face, Wheeler told police.

That’s when the mayor said he gave the man a final warning: “I informed him that I was carrying pepper spray and that I would use it if he did not back off,” Wheeler told police. When the man didn’t comply, Wheeler said, he pepper-sprayed him in the eyes. The man, who appeared surprised, according to Wheeler, finally backed off.

“You just pepper-sprayed me for no reason at all,” the man says in the recording captured by Adams.

“Actually,” Adams said in the recording, “I was here, and you were like a foot from him. He asked you to back away, and you didn’t.”

Wheeler later described the man to the police as a White man in his 40s.

Wheeler told police he feared the maskless man could infect him with the coronavirus, adding that he was also concerned for his personal safety following the incident where a woman allegedly smacked him in a restaurant earlier this month.

Before leaving, Wheeler said, he threw the man a bottle of water so he could wash out his eyes.

As the previous administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, Deborah Birx provided President Donald Trump with hard numbers to guide the fight against the pandemic. But all along, she said, Trump was receiving different statistics from someone else. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “Someone out there, or someone inside, was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president,” she said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I know what I sent up, and I know that what was in his hands was different.”

The 79-minute sit-down interview was Birx’s first since formally exiting her role advising the Trump administration. Birx told host Margaret Brennan that she “always” considered quitting her job, during which she alternately drew criticism from other scientists and Trump.

She said she will probably retire from her job at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within weeks after helping the Biden administration with its transition.

Birx, a well-regarded HIV researcher, was selected by Vice President Mike Pence last February to serve as his “right arm” leading the administration’s chaotic response to the pandemic.

But even after she arrived at the White House and briefed Trump on the growing threat to the country, Birx said he continued receiving — and passing on — “a parallel data stream coming into the White House that were not transparently utilized.”

“I saw the president presenting graphs that I never made,” she said.

Birx added that she believed at least some of the data had been funneled along by Scott Atlas, then a White House coronavirus adviser. He was widely rebuked for playing down the pandemic despite having no infectious-disease or public health background.

In an email to The Washington Post early Monday, Atlas said that any data he passed on to Trump was “directly from the CDC, [Department of Health and Human Services] and ongoing scientific literature,” and he maintained that listening to “additional scientists outside the administration” is “the way to arrive at the best policies.”

Anecdotes like those from Birx could be a preview of the disclosures still to come from other former Trump officials, who were tasked with battling a pandemic that has now killed more than 418,000 people in the United States.

The New York Times on Sunday published an interview with Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease specialist, in which he noted that he and his family began facing harassment and death threats as early as March.

“One day I got a letter in the mail, I opened it up and a puff of powder came all over my face and my chest,” he recalled. “That was very, very disturbing.”

While a security detail sprayed down Fauci’s office to get rid of the powder, which ended up being a “benign nothing,” the 80-year-old seemed to suggest that whatever was inside could have easily killed him.

Advertisement

“If it was ricin, I was dead, so bye-bye,” he said. (On several occasions, envelopes containing that lethal powder were intercepted before reaching the White House or other government officials.)

As the pandemic shut down the country last March, Fauci and Birx rapidly became the faces of the government response, appearing in daily news conferences alongside Trump, Pence and other top officials. While Birx put her support behind the administration and for a time received praise from Trump, the president criticized Fauci from the get-go for contradicting his efforts to play down a growing death toll.

Fauci, in his interview with the Times, noted that while he remained in his day job leading the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, “Birx had to live with this person in the White House every day. So it was much more of a painful situation for her.”

Advertisement

He faced repeated criticism from the president for going against the White House’s efforts to tamp down the virus, noting that Trump sometimes called him to “express disappointment” about these conflicts. Despite the pressure, he said he never thought about quitting his post.

“I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,” he said. “Even if I wasn’t very effective in changing everybody’s minds, the idea that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing back on it, I felt was important.”

Birx expressed more hesitations about her tenure, telling Brennan that she wishes she had been “more outspoken publicly” on matters such as coronavirus testing.

“I always feel like I could have done more. … I didn’t know all the consequences of all of these issues,” she said.

After the Associated Press reported last month that she had traveled to her Delaware vacation home over Thanksgiving, flouting public health warnings against such trips, she announced she would retire from her position at the CDC.

Well before that, however, she had anticipated that her role at the White House would be the final chapter of her career in the federal government.

“You can’t go into something that’s that polarized and not believe you won’t be tainted by that experience,” she said.

On her first day back teaching an undergraduate class in person at the University of Florida, one graduate teaching assistant wrestled with how often to tell her students to keep their masks above their noses, the best way to keep in-classroom students from mocking their classmate for wanting to attend virtually and how to stop students from breaking their socially distanced assigned seats.

“I felt at the time I couldn’t really just kick them out,” said the young worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, in an interview. “I didn’t expect there to be that much flagrant disrespect. They were just kind of talking to each other and commenting on how much they didn’t like the situation.”

Faculty and staff at the University of Florida have been at odds with school leaders since the start of the year over increasing its number of in-person classes to appease students who want face-to-face learning. Instructors are troubled that administrators could be more concerned about financial impacts than science and health as denials for American Disabilities Act accommodations rolled in against a backdrop of the campus’s safety app that now has a feature allowing students to report an instructor for not showing up to class and warnings against protesting.

The options for those who feel unsafe are pretty limited, multiple graduate workers told The Washington Post.

The graduate teaching assistant has been hunkered down with her immunocompromised partner since last spring, but Florida’s reopening of hybrid instruction, which includes reduced in-person and virtual learning, could jeopardize the protection she was hoping to provide her partner, she said.

Jason Crider, 30, a doctoral candidate in the English department, said that in many ways, he feels like he “has a gun” to his head when it comes to choosing between working and prioritizing his and his wife’s health.

“They told the students that they were welcome to attend virtually if they didn’t feel safe or sign up for the face-to-face option,” he said. “But they told faculty members and staff they had to be there.”

The Type 1 diabetic was denied temporary accommodations by the school’s ADA review team without an explanation, according to a review of the Nov. 2 document shared with The Post.

The university’s enhanced classroom safeguards, which includes KN-95 masks, face shields and physical distancing in classrooms, meant that his “request to work remotely was not approved as a reasonable accommodation,” according to the letter.

Type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes might increase the risk of severe illness from covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The university has specified that a person with a medical condition identified as “at increased risk” could have an accommodation, and Crider’s wasn’t on the school’s list of illness.

Crider’s denial isn’t unique among graduate workers or faculty who are trying to figure out ways to stay safe and provide quality education, according to Susan Hegeman, a spokesperson for the University of Florida chapter of United Faculty of Florida.

Hegeman said in a statement that the union has been in contact with 58 faculty members who requested accommodations but were denied, adding that 10 were later granted accommodations on appeal.

“The university COVID-ADA process denied many accommodation requests up front. They offered no accommodations for advanced age or for conditions that might pose increased risk for serious disease from covid, such as asthma and Type 1 diabetes,” she said in the statement. “There was no accommodation process for caretakers or family members of people at high risk for covid. This has caused a great deal of anxiety for many faculty.”

Bobby Mermer, co-president of Graduate Assistants United, a union for graduate workers at the university, said fewer than 100 requested accommodations in all were denied.

“Faculty are in precarious positions, but my members are in a more precarious position to be sure,” he said, adding that their low wages make them less likely to skip work. “It could’ve been everyone who asked for a remote [assignment] could’ve be been afforded one.”

Both unions have been deeply critical of how the school’s administration has handled reopening a campus that had more than 5,600 covid-19 cases as of Dec. 11, according to New York Times data.

Alachua County, where the university is seated, has reported more than 19,408 cases since the outset of the pandemic. More than 84 percent of its available hospital beds for covid-19 are occupied, according to county data.

Despite data that’s alarming some faculty members, the school hasn’t set benchmarks that would make instruction switch back to only online, according to Steve Orlando, assistant vice president of communications for the university.

Students enrolled for in-person classes increased from about 14,000 in the fall semester to about 25,000 — less than half total enrollment — this semester, he said, adding that the campus has ramped up its testing for faculty and students who live on campus or attend in-person classes and checked ventilation to make sure it meets CDC standards.

“There was no evidence of transmission during the fall semester,” he said. “We had about 1,100 instructors in classes and labs and only four reported cases.”

None of the four cases among instructors teaching in the fall were transmitted in the classroom, Orlando said.

The university has a less-than-1.5 percent positive rate of infection so far this semester, according to Orlando.

To ensure instructors show up to class regardless of their concerns or pending ADA requests, the school has updated its safety app, GatorSAFE, to include an option that lets students report an instructor for missing class.

Some graduate workers told the paper that their attendance is being checked by logging on to in-classroom computers. Orlando said that assertion is untrue and disputed by the provost.

The faculty union has argued that the app’s feature could violate the contract it has with the school as faculty themselves label it a “snitch app” and chide the new feature for its potentially divisive outcomes, student newspaper the Independent Florida Alligator reported.

Reports from the app will be directed to academic affairs and forwarded to a team who will have the discretion to determine disciplinary action.

“This is blatantly an affront to our academic freedom,” Crider said of the app and the suggestion that faculty shouldn’t encourage online options. “This is Orwellian. What’s more Big Brother than a snitch app?”

Crider has yet to receive an update about his ADA accommodation request. He was just cleared to be on campus as of Friday after reporting symptoms more than a week ago.

Because striking or staging collective movements, such as walkouts or sickouts, is not allowed for public employees in the state of Florida, the university might be pushing frustrated staff to enter a work-to-rule phase — in which employees do the minimum required — to express their displeasure, Mermer said.

For the graduate instructor who was too worried about facing consequences to identify herself, the only option she sees is reiterating safety concerns to her class and hoping the virus doesn’t become a concern again.

“It’s unsafe there’s not a definite point in which there’s too much [spread],” she said.

If the prior administration’s approach to the coronavirus pandemic consisted of doing as little as possible, letting the president subsume experts and trying to get by on “happy talk,” the Biden administration’s plan seems to be to do as much as possible, let the experts talk and lower expectations for a fast turnaround. That was certainly in evidence on Thursday.

The administration released another flurry of executive orders in addition to a nearly 200-page plan for addressing the pandemic. The Post reports: “The replacement plan synthesizes many of the goals and strategies for fighting the coronavirus that [President Biden] has mapped out in the weeks and days leading to his inauguration, including in a $1.9 trillion request to Congress for these efforts and to hasten the nation’s economic recovery.” While Biden described a variety of steps his administration will take — from reimbursement to states for their use of the National Guard to coordination with pharmacies to mandating worker safety for front-line workers — he warned, “Let me be very clear, things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.” He also stressed that public health officials will “work free from political interference and that they make decisions strictly based on science and health care alone, science and health alone, not what the political consequences are.”

In response to a shouted question as to why the goal for vaccinations in the first month is not higher than 100 million, he responded “Give me a break” and reminded reporters that they had recently said the plan was overly ambitious.

The shift in governance was evident at the White House news briefing, which lasted for more than an hour and included extended remarks from Anthony S. Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser. Fauci offered a blizzard of information on everything from the new coronavirus strain originating in Britain (it’s present in 20 states, he said) to whether the vaccine will work against mutations (yes, so far) to the seven-day average for new cases (plateauing, but unclear whether it’s a blip). If we can get 75 to 80 percent of the population vaccinated by the end of the summer, Fauci said, then we can at least approach normalcy in the fall. At times, reporters’ eyes seemed to glaze over from Fauci’s level of detail.

The White House press corps, however, seemed obsessed with getting Fauci to compare the Trump and Biden administrations, a sign that the fixation with politics over the conveyance of accurate information during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has not abated. Fauci chose his words carefully. He conceded that being free to say whatever the science tells him gave him “a somewhat liberating feeling.” And while he said not everything the Trump administration did was useless, he emphasized that there would be a huge ramping up of federal involvement. He said a big difference was the president’s directive to be entirely transparent.

Asked about the allegation that Amazon (whose chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Post) had not volunteered to help the Trump administration, Fauci, nearly giddy, replied, “One of the new things in this administration is if you don’t know the answer, don’t guess. Just say you don’t know the answer.” Fauci said just that when asked to extrapolate about how far along we would be if Biden’s plan had been adopted earlier.

Follow Jennifer Rubin 's opinions Follow

Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the same multiple times, not only on covid-related questions but on other topics in the briefing, ranging from Biden’s views on D.C. statehood to religious exemptions from health-care laws. Psaki repeatedly said she would “circle back"" with an answer for the reporter asking a question. The irony is that “I don’t know” is among the best answers a press secretary can give. It builds trust, allows for time to think up a better response, conveys where priorities rest (she knows answers on the big, important things, not on the minor items) and avoids being fact-checked after a false answer or speculation. It is a wonder why more administrations do not grasp this.

The bottom line is that for all the activity and information, the administration ultimately will be judged on what it does. The most the members of Biden team can do at this point is establish trust, give a sense of urgency to covid-19 vaccinations and testing, and apply pressure on Congress to get cracking on funding. So far, they seem to be hitting their marks.

Marty Makary is a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health. He is editor in chief of Medpage Today and author of “The Price We Pay.” As thousands of Americans perish daily due to covid-19 and the nation scrambles to ration a scarce vaccine supply, many Americans are appropriately asking: “Should I get the vaccine if I already had covid-19?” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says yes, with a narrow exception for those who have been infected in the past 90 days and received convalescent plasma or antibody therapy.

But this is outdated and fails to take natural immunity seriously. As a result of this flawed guidance, Americans with natural immunity — including many who are low-risk — are inappropriately getting the vaccine instead of high-risk seniors.

Many medical experts have been dismissive of natural immunity due to prior infection, but there is overwhelming data showing that covid-19 reinfections are rare, and when they do occur, the infection is often mild. A Public Health England study released last week found that less than 1 percent of 6,614 people who tested positive for covid-19 antibodies developed a reinfection within the five months studied.

That’s because the immune system works. Having the infection activates both antibodies as well as memory B- and T-cells, which teach your immune system to recognize the same virus in the future to swiftly eradicate it.

Natural immunity after covid-19 infection appears to last for at least the one year in which the virus has been circulating at large. Extrapolating from research on the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, it could be much longer. In one study of 176 people infected with SARS, immunity lasted for an average of two years. Another long-term analysis of health-care workers previously infected with SARS found antibodies up to 12 years later. Protective antibodies for the MERS coronavirus have similarly been documented to last for at least three years. And while the 1918 pandemic was caused by an influenza virus, the immune systems of those infected were able to make antibodies to the virus nearly nine decades later, a 2008 Nature study found.

Advertisement

Even mild infections appear to elicit a persistent and functional immune response. One recent European study found that people who had mild or asymptomatic covid-19 mounted a “robust T-cell immunity” afterward. A separate French study affirmed this, noting that some people who lived with a confirmed covid-infected person developed T-cell immunity even when they did not test positive for covid.

These scientific observations and the growing prevalence of natural immunity in the United States have significant implications for our national vaccine strategy. To maximally preserve human life, we should prioritize our limited vaccine supply to those who have never had covid-19. Given the scarcity of the vaccine, it doesn’t make sense to administer it to those who already had the disease while vulnerable seniors are sitting ducks in this pandemic war.

Many in the medical field have been playing down natural immunity. In the noble effort to overcome vaccine hesitancy, they argue that everyone should get the vaccine to reach herd immunity and reopen society. But we need to stick to the science. Let me be clear: I believe the vaccine is safe and strongly recommend that we vaccinate all Americans, but doing so is not a requirement to achieve herd immunity. Given that close to a third of all Americans and perhaps more have had covid-19 infections, it’s possible that herd immunity is closer than we think.

It is important to note that most experts predict that vaccinated immunity will probably last longer than natural immunity due to prior infection — a finding true of several other vaccines. But there is no clinical data to support that hypothesis, and expert predictions are not always correct. In fact, a few of my Johns Hopkins colleagues have suggested that natural immunity due to prior infection could be better than vaccinated immunity, pointing to the approximately 5 percent of infections in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna trials that occurred in people who received the vaccine. While getting the vaccine is far safer than getting the infection, it is entirely possible that the chances of infection for those vaccinated is similar to those who contracted the virus previously. Time will tell.

Personally, I side with the scientists who predict that vaccinated immunity will last longer than natural immunity, but let’s let science and not opinion answer that question. For those scientists who insist that vaccinated immunity is the only true immunity, I would remind them that there is absolutely zero data on covid-19 vaccine immunity after 300 days.

Given the scarcity of the lifesaving vaccine and the urgency for vulnerable Americans to get it quickly, people who had the infection should step aside and go to the back of the vaccine line. We lost more than 100,000 nursing home residents and staff to covid-19 last year, and 80 percent of all deaths have been in people 65 and older. The vaccine is currently a scarce resource. If we ration it wisely, we will save more lives and get back to normal life faster.

The coronavirus has now reached every county in the United States — even a remote Hawaiian outpost that was the last remaining holdout. Until recently, Kalawao County, which has fewer than 100 residents and was used as a leper colony for decades, was the only county in the nation that hadn’t reported a single case of the coronavirus. But even though it’s so isolated from the rest of the world that basic supplies have to be brought in by barge once a year, as the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, the virus still managed to make its way there.

According to Hawaii health officials, a resident who had traveled outside the community tested positive after flying home in December, ending Kalawao County’s impressive run. What could have been a disastrous outbreak was narrowly avoided, because that individual followed the county’s self-quarantine guidelines upon arrival — as did the other passengers the individual had close contact with during the flight.

The fact that Kalawao County remained virus-free for so long can partially be attributed to geography. Located on the small island of Molokai, its single town, Kalaupapa, can be reached only by hiking down 1,600-foot cliffs, catching a rare flight on a small plane or making an arduous three-mile trek by mule. That seclusion also explains its painful history: In 1865, Hawaii decided that anyone diagnosed with leprosy — now known as Hansen’s disease — would be exiled there for life.

Thousands of patients were never allowed to leave the tiny settlement, and could only interact with visiting family members through a chicken-wire screen. Though some ended up marrying fellow patients and doing their best to live normal lives, parents often had their newborn babies taken away to a nursery out of fear that the disease could be transmitted to the child.

In 1969, after a cure for Hansen’s disease was introduced, Hawaii finally overturned the mandatory quarantine policy. But some patients opted to stay on the island because they’d grown accustomed to the lifestyle and feared the stigma that they might face elsewhere. Though most of Kalawao County is now a national park, roughly a dozen survivors still live there today, in the care of the state.

“Our patients are, on average, 86 years old. They all have other health issues, so they’re at extreme high risk for covid mortality,” Baron Chan, the branch chief for Hansen’s disease at the Hawaii Department of Health, told KHON in October.

Before the pandemic, Kalawao County had roughly 100 residents, including National Park Service employees and health workers, Chan told the station. But as many as half that number have left since early March, when state health officials took aggressive measures to protect the remaining residents who were once Hansen’s disease patients. Visitors from outside the county were barred, and residents who left for other parts of the island or the state were told they would have to quarantine for two weeks upon returning.

As the nationwide death toll from the coronavirus reached staggering heights, many in Kalawao County came to appreciate those restrictions. “I don’t want to go Honolulu! You know, I don’t want to go to the other islands at this point,” Sister Alicia Damien Lau, a resident, told KHON in October. “You just get so paranoid.”

In fact, Kalawao was already so committed to following public health guidelines that the discovery of the first coronavirus case didn’t make much of an impact, locals told the Maui News. People had started wearing masks long before they were mandatory statewide, and the county was already effectively under lockdown, with most nonessential tasks put on hold.

“I don’t think there is any fear,” Patrick Killilea, a pastor at Kalawao County’s sole Catholic church, told the paper. “The rest of us just have to be careful as usual.”

Less than 24 hours after taking office, President Biden has released a national strategy to combat covid-19. In firmly establishing the federal government’s leadership role in pandemic response, this action is a 180-degree reversal of the Trump administration’s approach of denial, deflection and capitulation. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Biden strategy is to be applauded for its comprehensiveness. Where I wish it went further is with its boldness.

The United States is not where it was at the beginning of the pandemic, when Biden’s plan might have prevented us from passing one tragic milestone after another. Now, we are in a race against time, with the arrival of even more contagious variants coming on top of high baselines of infection. The steps that would have worked months ago are not nearly enough now; this is the time for much more aggressive federal action.

Let’s start with one of Biden’s first acts, the signing of an executive order to mandate masks in federal buildings. To be sure, this is a dramatic change from former president Donald Trump’s maskless parties in the White House. This order, combined with the subsequent executive orders signed Thursday to require masks on much interstate travel, will protect many Americans and send an unequivocal message that the new administration is following public health guidance.

But if the evidence is clear that masks save lives, why isn’t Biden issuing a full-on national mask mandate? Some have said any rules that reach beyond federal buildings and interstate commerce will face court challenges. Issuing a national mandate is the clearest signal that the country is in crisis; this very powerful tool must be used. And I believe that Biden can get around the issue of mandates being a state prerogative by tying federal funding to masking requirements. This will force governors’ hands: They can issue statewide mandates or forgo federal funds.

Biden needs to let Americans know that we can’t have our cake and eat it too. If we want kids back in school, we need to stop playdates. If we want to keep businesses open, we can’t dine inside one another’s homes. An outright ban on informal gatherings would be hard to enforce, but Biden can use the bully pulpit of the presidency to drive home the point that we all have to make difficult trade-offs.

At this point in the pandemic, our only way out is mass vaccination. Toward that end, Biden needs to aim higher — a lot higher. His goal of 100 million inoculations in 100 days might sound good, but it’s far from sufficient. Let’s assume that it will take 80 percent of the country being vaccinated to reach herd immunity. At the rate of 1 million vaccinations a day, with two doses required per person, it would take the United States until the summer of 2022 to reach herd immunity. Surely that’s not the moonshot to which we should aspire.

Actually, it’s a disappointingly low goal. There have already been several individual days when the U.S. has reached 800,000 to 900,000 vaccinations. That’s as part of a vaccine effort that Biden himself has referred to as a “dismal failure.” Reaching 1 million a day is hardly much of an improvement.

Biden’s team has laid out an ambitious vaccination plan that strives for both speed and equity. This plan should be accompanied by an equally ambitious goal. At the very least, we need to get to 2.5 million vaccinations a day; even at that rate, it will take well into this fall to reach herd immunity.

Perhaps the Biden team chose a low bar because they don’t want to follow the Trump playbook of overpromising and underdelivering. Perhaps they have new information. Last week, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar admitted there was no reserve of vaccines; maybe the Biden team has uncovered supply problems. If that’s the case, they should tell the Americans what they know, now. But if the supply will be there, they must aim to get vaccines into arms at a far greater pace.

Biden is inheriting the greatest crisis of our lifetimes, one that was made many times worse because of his predecessor’s inaction. In one day, Biden has already done more to restore faith in the government’s ability to address the pandemic than the Trump administration did in a year. To meet the moment, he must be even bolder. Such aspiration is our only hope for saving lives and livelihoods.

Somewhere in between drinking that last margarita and heading to the airport, travelers leaving Mexico are required to get a coronavirus test before returning to the United States, regardless of vaccination status. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight If you’re staying in a hotel or resort, or your trip was arranged by a travel adviser, you will probably have someone who can arrange testing for you. A concierge should know where to find approved tests or be able to arrange one on-site. Your hotel rate may even include a test.

But what if you’re someone like me who tends to stay in budget accommodations and Airbnbs?

On a recent trip to Mexico, I had to find a coronavirus test on my own. I had heard it would be simple for tourists, so I was confident in the task. While I did find one, I did encounter some hurdles. Here’s some advice for travelers planning to do the same.

What kind of test you’ll need

Anyone 2 years old and up entering the United States, including citizens and residents, must provide proof of a negative test result taken within 24 hours of their flight. (The rule doesn’t apply to people traveling by land or sea.)

Travelers can get a rapid antigen test or a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which includes PCR tests. But because PCR lab tests generally take a day or two to process, it may not be ready in time for your flight.

A better choice is the rapid antigen test, which I took. While the tests are less sensitive than PCR ones, these tend to be the fastest and most affordable testing option, and they deliver results in as little as 15 minutes.

How to start your search

If you’re not sure where to start your search for a test, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico has a covid-19 page on its website where one can find how to acquire a test, whether results are reliably available, how much one should cost and more.

You can also go to the local tourism office for help finding approved labs. Airlines, such as Aeromexico, also have information on their websites for finding tests around Mexico.

I assumed that I would run into coronavirus testing centers wherever I traveled. At first, that didn’t appear to be the case in the first city I visited, Merída, the capital of Yucatán state. If I had done more research, I would have found that there were plenty of options.

However, Google may not have the most up-to-date information on testing options. In the second stop on my trip, Playa del Carmen, I searched on Google Maps for “coronavirus test” and got just a few results at pharmacies. But after walking around town for a day, I saw there were dozens of locations nearby that Google hadn’t flagged.

If all else fails, head to tourist areas

Coronavirus testing centers for travelers are going to be in places that have the most travelers.

On a hunt for a tiny lunch spot far from the beach in Playa del Carmen, I didn’t notice any coronavirus testing centers among the butcher shops, clothing stores and laundromats. But when I turned down the city’s main tourist street, they suddenly were everywhere. They advertised fast results approved by the United States

Prices were around $25 to $30 for a rapid test, and $90 for a PCR. Most accepted walk-ins, but also took reservations if you want to plan ahead.

I spent the last few days of my trip in the beach town of Puerto Morelos. Googling testing options didn’t pull up many results, so I had a backup plan to drive to a larger city such as Cancún or Playa del Carmen. But luckily I found a testing center a block from where I was staying; it just wasn’t reflected online.

For about $25, the center’s lone employee took my ID (your name and birthday needs to be printed on the test results) and administered a rapid test. When the results were ready 15 minutes later, she gave me a printed copy and emailed me the digital version as a backup.

While I don’t recommend waiting until the last minute to get your test, some airports in Mexico have testing on-site. At Cancún International Airport, for example, they advertise first come, first served antigen tests for about $15 with results in 30 to 60 minutes.

Pack an approved self test

If you’d like to skip the process of finding a test altogether, you can bring a CDC-approved “self test” that you take over a video call with real-time supervision from a telehealth service.

One option is the Detect coronavirus test that uses the same technology as a PCR lab test and delivers results in about an hour. A kit costs $75; for $20 extra, travelers can purchase a video observation session so the test can meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requirement.

Last summer, I went with this option for a trip to Europe with the BinaxNOW kit (about $70 for a two pack). The night before my flight home to the United States, I downloaded the required app, followed the instructions and took the test while a telehealth professional walked me through it over a video call.

The testing process took about 25 minutes, plus another 30 minutes to wait for the results (you don’t have to sit around and watch the test.)

Once the results were ready, another telehealth professional came on the line to help interpret the results. We determined it was negative, and soon I received an email confirmation that I could show the airline the next day.

What to do with your results

For my American Airlines flight back from Mexico, I wasn’t allowed to check-in until I uploaded a photo of my coronavirus test result into an app called VeriFLY, which stores your required documents for travel. I sent in my results, had them approved hours later and completed the standard American Airlines check-in process.

Not all airlines use so-called vaccine passports such as VeriFLY. You may be asked to provide a paper or electronic copy of your test results to airline personnel at the airport.

After a six-hour layover at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the second leg of my journey home from Mexico was canceled with no other options to fly that evening. Should you be one of the many unlucky travelers whose flights into the United States are canceled and rescheduled for the next day, you will need to be retested to meet the CDC requirement. Should you be one of the even unluckier travelers to test positive abroad, you won’t be allowed to fly back until you’ve completely recovered from the illness.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last week that the United States will require a negative coronavirus test result taken within 72 hours before arrival for all international arrivals, beginning next week. The new rule is an effort to keep out a fast-moving new variant of the coronavirus, but in the rollout of the new health protocols, some travel groups saw an opportunity to restart some banned international travel.

Airlines for America, a trade group that lobbies for the biggest airlines in the United States, called for the new testing rule to replace bans on international travelers from countries with cases of the new strain.

If it were not for a new administration taking office, the bans would have been lifted: Trump signed a proclamation that was swiftly ruled out by the Biden administration. Trump called removing travel restrictions on Europe and Brazil (while leaving in place restrictions on travel from China and Iran) “the best way to continue protecting Americans from covid-19 while enabling travel to resume safely.”

But even with the travel bans staying, experts say that the new U.S. entry requirement, which allows for less-accurate rapid antigen tests, is not as robust as other countries’ testing protocols — and coronavirus-infected travelers could make it past testing barriers and onto planes undetected. There have been such cases in New Zealand, Hawaii and, most recently, Australia.

The new system is being implemented as the nation’s health officials attempt to prevent a new, highly contagious variant of the coronavirus, which has been detected in both Europe and Brazil, from becoming dominant in the United States, although some experts fear rapid antigen tests may be even less effective on the new strains.

Carlos Acuna-Villaorduna, an epidemiologist with expertise on modeling of infectious diseases at Boston Medical Center, says travel bans have value in times when certain regions are experiencing a high volume of a contagious disease. He also notes that allowing rapid antigen tests (which are 20 percent less effective than lab tests), is particularly risky for the new strain, which some experts think is less detectable by those kinds of tests.

“We don’t know how accurate the rapid tests are for the new strain. There is some concern some can be false negative” because of the make up of the new strain, Acuna-Villaorduna says. “It doesn’t mean that we need to completely block all travel, but we as a society should manage the risk of traveling. From a modeling standpoint allowing travel from those high-infection areas, you are going to see an increase in cases regardless of measures.”

If rapid tests are as effective on the new strain, doctors say, antigen tests are still about 20 percent less effective in detecting positive cases.

“The message needs to be gotten across that [the new system] is not going to make airplanes 100 percent safe,” says David Freedman, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “About 90 percent of countries requiring pre-departure testing require PCR [tests]. It’s only a small number, which now includes the U.S., that will allow an antigen test.”

Even if the United States stopped allowing for those less-accurate antigen tests to be used, cases could get through. Infectious-disease doctors like Freedman have long said that coronavirus tests taken during a patient’s virus incubation period will be negative, even though the person can become highly contagious hours later.

Over the weekend, a cluster of U.S.-linked coronavirus cases were found on fully pretested flights to Australia (which requires PCR tests) from Los Angeles.

Three passengers on the 18-hour journey tested positive for the virus on arrival in Australia despite testing negative for the virus within 72 hours before the flight, resulting in quarantines for dozens of people and athletes heading to Melbourne for next month’s Australian Open.

And other examples of flight-linked coronavirus cases make it clear that you can be tested and still bring the virus into a country: New Zealand, which has similarly strict rules to Australia (requiring multiple tests and quarantines for entry), prevented a cluster of flight-linked cases from entering the country this summer despite the original case testing negative for the virus as required.

The incoming Biden administration agreed with that sentiment, saying Monday that it will not allow those travel restrictions to be immediately lifted. The policy requiring a coronavirus test three days before departure also will stand.

“With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,” Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Twitter. “On the advice of our medical team, the [Biden] Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.”

On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19. — Jen Psaki (@jrpsaki) January 19, 2021

Medical experts also say the 72-hour timeline for the tests, which requires swabs be taken no more than three days before flying, is a relatively broad window of time which could allow the virus to develop in a person’s system undetected before a flight.

A report by the International Civil Aviation Organization recently estimated that testing passengers three days out via a PCR lab (not the less-effective rapid testing) is about 75 percent effective in keeping infected people off the plane.

“In other words, 25% of cases could be getting onboard,” Freedman says.

ICAO estimated that 48 hours would be a safer window of time, but Freedman notes that shortening the time frame would “present issues of practicality” by leaving travelers with little time to acquire a test result from the time of their appointment. PCR labs typically take two to three days to return results.

A quarantine or follow-up testing requirement like Australia’s, Acuna-Villaorduna says, would be a helpful additional layer in catching those cases. But it would not catch them all.

“Doing all interventions, like PCR [tests], quarantines, symptom screening, that certainly would decrease the transmission,” Acuna-Villorduna says. “But it would not eliminate it completely.”

“A big part of this is just keeping most of those cases of dangerous strains out of the U.S., but people shouldn’t think that it’s going to keep every case out of the U.S.,” Freedman says, “And it won’t keep every infected person off a plane.”

Covid-19 has now killed more than 400,000 Americans. The country reached that devastating milestone Tuesday, the eve of the first anniversary of the first confirmed U.S. case and the final full day of Donald Trump’s presidency, which historians say will be defined by his bungling of the public health crisis.

“To heal, we must remember,” President-elect Joe Biden said in a Tuesday evening vigil for coronavirus victims at the Lincoln Memorial. “And it’s hard sometimes to remember. But that’s how we heal. It’s important to do that as a nation. That’s why we’re here today.”

The somber event offered a striking contrast to Trump’s near-constant downplaying of the virus, and served as the new administration’s signal that it would take the dangerous pandemic seriously.

Here are some significant developments:

Most Americans think the pandemic is out of control in the United States, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. Attitudes about the virus and vaccines differ across party lines.

Trump awarded presidential commendations on Tuesday to officials involved in Operation Warp Speed, which is overseeing vaccine distribution. Recipients included Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony S. Fauci and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Several national public health officials received their second doses of the coronavirus vaccine, including National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins, Azar and Fauci, Collins said Tuesday.

California public health officials have paused the administration of about 330,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine as they investigate reports of a “higher-than-usual number” of severe allergic reactions to the drug.

A Florida data scientist who said she was fired by the state for her conflicting data about the coronavirus pandemic turned herself in on accusations of “illegally” accessing the health department platform and sending a message to about 1,750 people.

China is hurrying to build a coronavirus quarantine center with a 4,000-person capacity in the city of Shijiazhuang, the latest virus hot spot in the county.

World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday that the world is nearing a “catastrophic moral failure” as wealthy countries control vaccine supplies that could leave poorer nations to struggle more with curtailing the virus’s spread.

At the Lincoln Memorial vigil, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris invited the nation to mourn together, encouraging Americans to place candles in their windows and asking local leaders to illuminate city buildings and ring church bells.

“For many months, we have grieved by ourselves,” Harris said. “Tonight we grieve and begin healing together.”

People are dying at a pace unmatched by any other stretch of this pandemic — including the darkest days of spring, when mobile morgues lined the streets of New York City. It took just over a month for the U.S. death toll to climb from 300,000 to 400,000, twice as fast as it rose from 200,000 to 300,000, according to data gathered and analyzed by The Washington Post.

The United States has reported more than 24 million total cases. The number of people felled by the virus is now greater than the populations of New Orleans and Tampa. In the coming days, the toll will probably surpass the number of U.S. casualties in World War II. The fatality figures are so staggering that many Americans have said they feel numb as they try to reckon with one of the biggest mass casualty events in the country’s history.

And yet, action has never been more critical.

States have only distributed half of the 31 million coronavirus vaccine doses they have received, according to The Post’s tracking, and Americans are wondering when they will be able to get their shots.

As they wait, the virus continues its spread and hospitals try to make space for new covid-19 patients.

In Los Angeles County, which has emerged as a hot spot, leaders welcomed Biden’s inauguration and said they anticipate a greater level of cooperation with local governments from his administration.

“We expect our situation to improve greatly,” Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Hilda L. Solis said Tuesday. “I’m hoping now that we’ll have that coordination that was lacking in terms of the federal government.”

In New York, the early epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, state officials say they have administered first doses to more than 1 million people, nearly half of them in New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that the city expects to run out of its vaccine supply on Thursday and won’t get more doses until next week.

“We will have literally nothing left to give as of Friday,” de Blasio said at a news conference, where he called on the federal government to send the city more vaccine.

“This is crazy,” he said. “This is not the way it should be. We have the ability to vaccinate a huge number of people. We need the vaccine to go with it.""

De Blasio, who competed with Biden for the Democratic nomination, said he hoped the incoming administration would “fix a lot of this.”

New Yorkers, however, are bracing for still more tough times, according to a new poll from Siena College Research Institute. More than half of polled New York state voters — 55 percent — said the worst of the pandemic is still to come, even though a similar number said the Biden administration bodes well for the state.

Meanwhile, European nations are also wrestling with containment of the virus and its mutations. The European Commission urged its member countries to vaccinate at least 70 percent of their adult population by June, Agence France-Presse reported.

E.U. health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said “the worldwide shortage of production capacity” has slowed the rollout of vaccinations. She also said there are discussions about standard vaccine certificates that would be recognized among member nations, according to Agence France-Presse.

German leaders have extended and tightened restrictions amid concerns over a new virus variant first discovered in the United Kingdom and South Africa and another new variant recently found in 35 patients at a hospital in a Bavarian ski town, CNBC reported.

Britain reported more than 1,600 people dead Tuesday, a new single-day death record that brings the country’s overall count above 90,000. More than 4.2 million people there have received the first dose of a vaccine.

One of the passengers who tried to revive a man on a cross-country United flight in December said the airline emailed him a voucher for $200 for his “help/inconvenience on the flight” last week. Tony Aldapa, an intermediate medical technician at a Los Angeles hospital, said that was in addition to a $75 voucher that a flight attendant gave him on the plane. He said a customer service representative also called.

While Aldapa said he would use the voucher for an upcoming flight, he was put off that he hadn’t seen any public statement from the airline acknowledging the efforts to help the passenger. He said he didn’t need praise.

“What I would have appreciated was acknowledgement,” he said in an email. “Any kind of statement regarding what happened from anyone in the company would have been good, about us passengers that helped, about the flight attendants or the pilots, anything to show that the higher-ups in the company were following the story. But the only thing I ever saw were the statements saying it wasn’t their responsibility to notify passengers.”

A United spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment or questions about whether other passengers were also offered vouchers.

Aldapa and a couple of other passengers on the Dec. 14 Orlando-to-Los Angeles flight performed CPR on a 69-year-old man for about 45 minutes as the flight was diverted to New Orleans. The man was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.

At the time, the man’s wife said he had been experiencing symptoms of covid-19, but passengers were left to wonder for days if they had been exposed. A medical examiner ruled about a week later that the man died of covid-19 and acute respiratory failure.

United handed over its manifest when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requested it, but the airline referred questions about the man’s health to the agency. The CDC would not release health information about him for privacy reasons. Aldapa was not officially notified that he had been exposed until Dec. 24, when he got word from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. He felt ill after the flight, but he tested negative for the virus and has since gotten his first dose of the vaccine.

In his statement, Aldapa said he had not asked for any reimbursement from United and was not bothered by the voucher amount. He also praised the flight crew for their actions during the ordeal. But, he said, United dropped the ball on customer service after the fact.

“They knew they had three passengers that busted their butts for an hour on one of their flights, yet nobody with any kind of rank in the company ever reached out to check on us,” he said. “That’s what bothers me the most.”

She had mothered him since he turned up in her bilingual-education classroom in Washington, D.C., a scrawny 10-year-old fresh from El Salvador. Under her care, he had adjusted to a new world, learned English, graduated from high school, become a responsible adult.

Many times before, she had refused to give up on him when others might have. Now, on a video call just before Christmas, she felt she could see the strength left in him. His upper arms still bulged with muscle.

“Nelson, open your eyes,” she said. “Can you open your eyes for me?”

But they remained closed.

“That’s okay, don’t worry about it,” she said. “Maybe you can do it later.”

It was eerie seeing him like that, so still and so quiet. He had spent his life in constant motion since coming to the United States with two teenage brothers to reunite with their mother, who had come years ahead of them.

Always moving, always talking, young Nelson was a constant disruption in class. But kids like him drew Rogers to this work. “Whenever I looked into his eyes, even when I was mad at him,” she said, “I always saw light.”

When a child welfare agent said things weren’t working out for the 10-year-old at home, Rogers agreed to take him for a night. At bedtime, she laid linens out on the couch and read to him until he fell asleep. When he woke later, afraid of the dark, she curled up on the love seat and slept near him.

That night became two, and soon the boy claimed a futon in the upstairs office. Its closet filled with pajamas, Hot Wheels toy cars, bats and balls, a suit for Sunday church.

Foster workers talked about putting him in a group home or finding a Latino foster family. Rogers, who is Black and grew up in the D.C. area, fought to keep him.

Early on, he chewed things, like buttons off the TV remote, and Rogers learned this was not uncommon for children who had gone stretches with little food. One time, he used the cigarette lighter of her Mazda to burn holes in its seat. It left her wondering: Did he want to see whether her love would hold?

“I just thought that I had to try harder,” she said.

He stole things compulsively: toys, trinkets, money. Rogers would force him to return them, while trying to figure out what he really needed and how to teach him it wasn’t on a store shelf.

When he got lost in middle school, skipping class and getting into trouble, she found a friend to home-school him.

She found outlets for his hyperactivity in dance and theater, and she signed him up for karate. Before long, he was meticulously ironing his white cotton uniforms and moving up from belt to belt.

In adulthood, too, Orellana Garcia’s energy seemed limitless. He worked at Mary McLeod Bethune Day Academy, a public charter school in Northeast Washington, and played rugby and pickup basketball — sometimes both on the same afternoon — until the coronavirus pandemic struck.

In September, he started feeling tired and sick. A coronavirus test came back positive. He began having chest pains and trouble breathing and was taken by ambulance to Doctors Community Hospital in Lanham, Md.

“COVID pneumonia finally got me. And I know I’m doing fine because the doctors are working hard on me,” he posted on Facebook. “I’ll be back healthy and strong.”

But his oxygen levels kept dropping, and he was transferred to MedStar, a large private hospital in Northwest Washington, where doctors cut him open to insert tubes into his blood vessels.

MedStar officials, citing patient privacy rights, declined to comment on his treatment.

A machine began removing blood from Orellana Garcia’s body, running it through a machine to absorb oxygen and then returning it.

The process, called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, is a last resort for covid-19 patients whose oxygen levels remain low even on ventilators.

“It’s basically a transition to let your lungs recover,” said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “It’s not something you can keep somebody on.”

Rogers was allowed to see Orellana Garcia some this fall before a new surge of coronavirus infections shut down most visitations at MedStar. Doctors periodically lowered his sedation for neurological exams, and when she arrived on Nov. 19, nurses told her he was awake enough to hear and respond to questions.

His eyes were open but not tracking her movements. Rogers held his hand. She asked whether he knew who she was, and he squeezed. She asked whether he could wiggle his toes, and he did. She asked whether he was afraid. He squeezed, and tears filled his eyes.

Was he afraid of dying? she asked. He squeezed several times.

As it became clear Orellana Garcia’s lungs would not get better, his doctors applied to several medical centers for him to receive a lung transplant. In deciding who is eligible, doctors assess whether a patient could survive traveling to the facility, undergoing surgery that can last 12 hours and then a lengthy recovery process.

In early December, MedStar told Rogers that her son’s condition was deemed too weak for a transplant. It was time to let him go, a doctor told her by phone.

“You have tried to love him through this,” Rogers recalls a hospital official saying that week, during a videoconference with her and Orellana Garcia’s birth family, with whom he had remained close over the years. “There’s nothing more for you to do.”

Rogers was stunned. It bothered her that the doctors weren’t asking for permission, but presenting a decision already made. Hadn’t her son showed them he would fight to hang on? Orellana Garcia’s birth mother was also unconvinced. The woman pleaded with the officials to let the young man stay on the machines and leave it in God’s hands.

Years before, Rogers’s father had been a surgeon with a private practice linked to Howard University Hospital. After he suffered a brain aneurysm, she sat by his side as they removed his life support. His heart kept beating fiercely, and she wondered whether they had done the right thing. It took him hours to die. But her father, who had spent his life helping people at the edge of death, had made his own wishes clear long before: No heroics.

To Rogers, what was happening now was different. Orellana Garcia’s brain, as far as anyone could tell, was fully intact. And she’d never had a deep conversation with him about end-of-life wishes.

A local television station ran a segment about him, and the publicity brought offers of help.

Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, one of the institutions that had deemed Orellana Garcia ineligible for a transplant, took a second look, asking Rogers for information and paperwork. The hospital, which has performed 10 covid-19-related lung transplants — more than any other place in the world — declined to comment on Orellana Garcia’s case, citing privacy rules.

A right-to-life group found Rogers a lawyer, John Kiyonaga, who wanted her to ask Orellana Garcia what he wanted.

Her chance came on a video call two days after Christmas. Again, doctors had lowered his sedation to examine him.

The nurse positioned the camera close to his face, and it seemed to Rogers that his eyes focused on hers.

“Do you want us to do everything possible to keep you alive?” she asked. He nodded yes.

“Are you in pain?”

He shook his head no.

Then she asked him the question she had asked before. “Do you feel afraid?”

This time, he shook his head no.

On the last day of 2020, Rogers went to bed feeling something like hope. She had begun to think ahead to a fundraiser to handle costs associated with the transplant. She wondered whether she was about to relocate to Chicago, where she might need to stay for a year.

But on New Year’s Day, she got another call from MedStar. Northwestern had determined, again, that her son would not survive a transplant.

The doctor was kind but firm, Rogers said. He told her there was nothing else they could do.

That same day, a doctor Kiyonaga had consulted gave the same opinion.

On Jan. 6, Rogers was allowed a final visit to Orellana Garcia’s hospital room. His birth family had been the day before.

Nurses had turned on soft music and dimmed the lights. He seemed to be asleep. Doctors assured Rogers he was comfortable.

Over the decades, Rogers had learned that motherhood meant doing hard things. She no longer believed that what she was doing was giving up. Rather, she thought, it was the last act of mothering she could give her son.

She held his hand and told him how proud she was of him and that it was okay to stop fighting.

Behind her, they did something to the machines. He took several deep breaths, and then he was still.

First, Florida health officials fired data scientist Rebekah Jones, accusing her of repeated insubordination as she was putting together the state’s coronavirus dashboard. Then, after she started her own website to publish pandemic data, armed police officers raided her home in Tallahassee. Last week, a warrant was issued for her arrest for computer crimes.

So Jones, who has clashed with Florida officials as she claims they tried to manipulate official numbers on the pandemic, turned herself in to authorities over the weekend.

“To protect my family from continued police violence, and to show that I’m ready to fight whatever they throw at me, I’m turning myself into police in Florida Sunday night,” Jones wrote on Twitter. “The Governor will not win his war on science and free speech.”

After posting bail and being released Monday from a jail in Tallahassee, she told reporters that she had tested positive for the coronavirus while in custody. Her lawyer, Stephen Dobson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

Jones’s arrest and diagnosis are the latest developments in a contentious public battle between the 31-year-old and state officials since she was fired from the Florida Department of Health in May. As she has accused the state of mismanaging the pandemic, she says she’s being silenced by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and his administration.

Jones, who had worked as a geographic information systems manager, said she objected to what she considered unethical requests from her supervisors to change the state’s coronavirus data dashboard. For instance, she claims, she was asked to undercount infections and over-count the number of people tested. (Officials have denied this.)

After her dismissal, Jones launched her own data portal, advertising it as a transparent and independent alternative.

Then, on Nov. 10, state police say, a Florida Department of Health messaging platform was breached by an Internet protocol address that traced back to Jones. Members of a group specializing in public health emergencies received an unauthorized message on the system.

“It’s time to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead,” the message said, according to an affidavit filed by state police. “You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it’s too late.”

But about a month later, Florida police officers with guns drawn raided Jones’s Tallahassee home, searching for her computer, phone and other hardware she used to operate her independent website.

The raid drew widespread criticism from several Democratic officials in Florida and prompted at least one Republican appointee, Ron Filipkowski, to step down from a state judicial panel.

“It just seems like it’s not really about any kind of criminal investigation,” Filipkowski told The Post last month. “It’s about intimidation of her and sending a message to people currently working in state government that, ‘This could be you.’”

Following the raid, Jones continued to speak out on social media and to reporters. Last month, she told CNN she feared state officials would use her electronic devices to identify state employees leaking information.

On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement obtained a warrant for Jones’s arrest.

By then, she and her family had relocated to Chevy Chase, Md. Police told her that if she did not turn herself in by Monday, she would be arrested in the Washington area, Dobson, her lawyer, told Florida Today.

So over the weekend, she posted one final tweet — “Censored by the state of Florida until further notice” — and drove more than 850 miles to Tallahassee “sick as could be,” Dobson said. Once she was in jail, Dobson and Jones learned she had tested positive for the coronavirus. The Leon County Sheriff’s Office, which manages the facility, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokesperson for FDLE said in a statement to The Post that Jones had been charged under the Florida computer crimes statute for “offenses against users of computers, computer systems, computer networks and electronic devices.”

The agency’s statement added that “evidence retrieved from a search warrant” on Dec. 7, the same day Jones’s home was raided, shows that she “illegally accessed” the health department platform and sent a message to about 1,750 people.

Jones’s arrest warrant, which was obtained by The Post, said the unauthorized message created “doubt and confusion” among those on the system and diverted the attention of about 30 employees to address what they believed was a possible cyberattack.

It also claims she again tried to access the messaging platform on Nov. 12 and downloaded and saved health department data with contact information for tens of thousands of people in Florida, saving it to her own devices.

Dobson told Florida Today that as of Monday afternoon, the Florida state attorney’s office had yet to file formal charges.

According to the newspaper, Jones appeared in court late Monday morning, where a judge set her bond at $2,500. The judge rejected requests from FDLE to ban Jones from using computers and place a GPS tracking device on her.

“It was a little bit of overreach,” Dobson said of the requests. “I think this entire case has been [an] overreach.”

As New Jersey expands its coronavirus vaccine distribution this week, state officials announced that anyone 65 or over can now get the shots, as well as those between 16-64 with certain medical conditions. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One group covered among those medical conditions, though, has raised backlash — namely, the state’s roughly 2 million smokers, who can now get the vaccine before teachers or public transit workers.

State officials say smokers should be a priority for the nearly 732,000 doses New Jersey has received so far because, just like those suffering from other underlying medical conditions, they run the risk of experiencing more severe covid-19 symptoms.

“Smoking puts you at a significant risk for and adverse result from covid-19,” state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said at a Wednesday news conference.

But some public health experts said they struggled to make sense of that decision.

“This would not be a group that would bubble up to high priority,” Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told The Washington Post. “Just smoking doesn’t cut it in my view,” arguing that only smokers also suffering from a chronic respiratory condition should get early vaccines.

The conflict highlights the difficult decisions that state officials must make in deciding how to deliver millions of doses of the vaccine and who should get first dibs, a process that has been delayed and hampered by uneven federal coordination, experts say.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) announced the changes Wednesday as the state seeks to accelerate a lagging vaccination operation that has failed to meet immunization targets. As of Thursday, at least 263,422 first doses had been administered in New Jersey, covering 7.5 percent of the prioritized population, according to The Post’s vaccine tracker.

The state had first opened up its vaccine supplies to health-care workers, nursing home employees and residents, and later, police and firefighters. In his Wednesday announcement, Murphy said the medical conditions that will now be covered under the expansion include cancer, Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, among others. State officials won’t require any documentation of the medical condition or the recipient’s age, Persichilli said.

By including smokers, the state health department noted that New Jersey was following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, which says smoking puts people at higher risk of developing severe symptoms of covid-19.

“Nicotine is one of the most powerful addictions,” a spokeswoman with the state’s health department told NBC New York in a statement. “Smoking put individuals at higher risk for more severe disease. If an individual who smokes gets COVID, they get sicker much quicker.”

Some critics argued that smokers are choosing to put themselves at higher risk, and many could stay home to protect themselves — as opposed to taking a vaccination that could go to someone at higher risk.

Nick Zaneto, a teacher and coach at Metuchen High School told NorthJersey.com many at his school were shocked the state had prioritized smokers.

“It’s not a medical condition that you’re a smoker,” Zaneto told the local paper. “You’re making a personal choice to either vape or smoke cigarettes. As a teacher, we try to teach our students to stay away from bad habits like smoking, and this almost seems like a reward for those individuals.”

But Esther Choo, an emergency physician and professor at Oregon Health and Science University, says it’s wrong to de-prioritize smokers or others with substance abuse.

“There’s a very steep and judgmental slippery slope when we start to say that one group or the other does not deserve vaccines based on your health behavior, particularly when we understand smoking to be a substance use disorder,” Choo told The Post.

She added, “It’s a nuanced and balanced decision, but I actually agree with considering high-risk factors when it comes to vaccine prioritizing, and smoking is a high-risk factor.”

But Topol said many smokers don’t actually have the underlying medical issues that would put them at higher risk of covid-19 complications.

“Just being a smoker without chronic obstructive lung disease, that isn’t considered a coexisting condition,” he said. “It doesn’t deserve special priority in my view. If they have lung disease, asthma, diabetes, that’s a different matter.”

President-elect Joe Biden called on Congress Thursday night to pour another roughly $400 billion into fighting the coronavirus pandemic to create a national vaccination program, expand testing and hire 100,000 more community health workers. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Part of a broad relief package to lift up the nation’s economy and ease the devastation caused by the pandemic at its worst moment so far, Biden’s request spells out his oft-stated determination for the federal government to assume a far more muscular role in responding to the public health crisis.

The scale of what the president-elect envisions far outstrips the funding Congress devoted to fighting the pandemic in a stimulus package it adopted late last year, as well as the sums that House Democrats had unsuccessfully sought.

In particular, senior members of the incoming administration said before Biden’s speech that he wants to invest an additional $20 billion to build a federal infrastructure for administering vaccine doses to protect Americans against ­ the virus, which causes the disease covid-19. It would include adding an unspecified number of locations in communities across the country where people could get shots, as well as mobile sites to go into rural communities and other places where retail pharmacies and health-care facilities are scarce.

“As a nation, we will have to move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated,” Biden said. “The more people we vaccinate, the faster we do it, the sooner we can save lives and put this pandemic behind us and get back to our lives and our loved ones.”

Biden’s push a half-dozen days before he takes office comes as criticism has mounted of the sluggish pace of immunizing Americans, since two vaccines won federal authorization for emergency use last month. The mass vaccination campaign is considered urgent to protect people from the virus, which is overwhelming many hospitals and killing thousands of people every day.

As of Thursday, at least 11.1 million people have received a first dose of one of the vaccines, each of which requires a ­two-dose regimen. That is slightly more than a third of the 30.6 million doses that have been distributed to states, cities and U.S. territories, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Biden said more than a month ago that he wants 100 million shots to be given within the first 100 days of his presidency, a period that goes through late April.

He is scheduled to release a detailed vaccine plan Friday, but the financial underpinnings laid out Thursday reflect the fundamental difference between the incoming administraton’s approach and that of President Trump’s. In the fall, the Trump administration directed each state to write and submit its own vaccination plan. Biden’s team maintains that such an unprecedented vaccination campaign requires strong federal coordination, greater funding and some aspects to be run by the federal government itself.

Biden is appealing to lawmakers and the American public as Democrats are about to inherit narrow control of the Senate, along with their House majority. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who is expected to lead the chamber’s committee dealing with health matters, praised the president-elect’s proposal as signaling “help is on the way.”

The $20 billion Biden requested in additional money for vaccines compares with nearly $29 billion included in Congress’s December stimulus package — about $9 billion of the latter for vaccine distribution.

Overall, the roughly $400 billion for fighting the pandemic in Biden’s relief request compares with roughly $50 billion approved by Congress last month for that purpose, according to Marc Goldwein, senior vice president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Goldwein said House Democrats had wanted earlier last year to spend approximately $100 billion for that purpose.

The president-elect also wants to invest $50 billion in a ­large-scale expansion of coronavirus testing, including the purchase of tests that provide rapid results and the expansion of laboratory capacity. Such expansion, his team contends, would allow schools to test students and staff more frequently, ­making it safe for schools to reopen — another goal he set last month for his first 100 days in office.

Biden is seeking money to hire 100,000 public health workers to encourage people to get vaccinated, as well as to do contact tracing to figure out who has been exposed by people who test positive. Over the longer term, he envisions these workers helping to build up the nation’s depleted public health departments. His advisers did not spell out how much money would be needed for this purpose.

A portion of the funds would be used to expand genomic sequencing to detect new strains of the virus, including more-rapidly spreading variants that were first detected in Britain and South Africa.

Other aspects of his request are intended to provide help to people living in poor communities or those belonging to racial and ethnic minorities who have been especially hit hard by the pandemic. His proposal would expand funding for community health centers and for health services for Native Americans on tribal lands.

The proposal would, in addition, help states deploy “strike teams” to nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities with outbreaks, as well as to help slow the virus spread in prisons and detention centers.

Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat, represents New Jersey’s 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Over the past day, a lot of people have asked me how I feel. They are usually referring to my covid-19 diagnosis and my symptoms. I feel like I have a mild cold. But even more than that, I am angry.

I am angry that after I spent months carefully isolating myself, a single chaotic day likely got me sick. I am angry that several of our nation’s leaders were unwilling to deal with the small annoyance of a mask for a few hours. I am angry that the attack on the Capitol and my subsequent illness have the same cause: my Republican colleagues’ inability to accept facts.

When I left for Washington last week, it was my first trip there in several months. I had a list of things to accomplish, including getting my picture taken for the card I use when voting on the House floor. For the past two years, I appeared on that card completely bald as a result of the chemotherapy I underwent to eliminate the cancer in my right lung. It was because of that preexisting condition that I relied so heavily on the proxy voting the House agreed to last year, when we first began to understand the danger of covid-19.

Advertisement

I was nervous about spending a week among so many people who regularly flout social distancing and mask guidelines, but I could not have imagined the horror of what happened on Jan. 6.

To isolate as much as possible, I planned to spend much of my day in my apartment, shuttling to the House floor to vote. But the building shares an alley with the Republican National Committee, where, we’d later learn, law enforcement found a pipe bomb. I was evacuated from that location early in the afternoon.

The next best option would have been my office in the Cannon House Office Building, where just three of my staffers worked at their desks to ensure safe distancing. Before I arrived, security evacuated that building as well, forcing us to linger in the hallways and cafeteria spaces of the House complex. As I’m sure you can imagine, pushing the occupants of an entire building into a few public spaces doesn’t make for great social distancing. Twice, I admonished groups of congressional staff to put on their masks. Some of these staffers gave me looks of derision, but slowly complied.

Advertisement

My staff and I then decided that the Capitol building would likely be the safest place to go, since it would be the most secure and least likely to be crowded. I’ve spent a lot of time since in utter disbelief at how wrong those assumptions turned out to be.

Everyone knows what happened next: A mob broke through windows and doors and beat a U.S. Capitol Police officer, then went on a rampage. Members and staff took cover wherever we could, ducking into offices throughout the building, then were told to move to a safer holding location.

I use “safer” because, while we might have been protected from the insurrectionists, we were not safe from the callousness of members of Congress who, having encouraged the sentiments that inspired the riot, now ignored requests to wear masks.

I’ve been asked if I will share the names of those members. You’ve probably seen video of some of them laughing at my colleague and friend Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) as she tries to distribute masks. But it’s not their names that matter.

Advertisement

What matters are facts, both about the covid-19 pandemic and the conduct of the 2020 election:

You can, in fact, breathe through a mask. Doctors have been doing it for decades. It is occasionally annoying — my glasses tend to fog, and when I wear makeup and a mask, I end up with smudged lipstick. That is a small price to pay for the safety of those around me.

You can, in fact, count on a mask to reduce the chances of spreading the virus. Studies of how many droplets escape into the air and the rates of infection following the implementation of mask mandates both prove effectiveness.

Refusing to wear a mask is not, in fact, an act of self-expression. It’s an act of public endangerment. The chaos you create in exercising your so-called freedom can cause permanent, deadly damage. I only hope that won’t be the case for me and my colleagues, Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), who have also tested positive for the coronavirus.

When I say that many Republicans are responsible for what happened to me, to others and to the country last week, I mean their essential failure to accept facts led us here. Much like they should be able to accept the results of an election, elected leaders should be able to accept facts like the efficacy of masks. It’s clearly time for a congressional campuswide mask requirement, enforced by the House and Senate sergeants at arms.

Facts really do matter. I hope to get back to work soon to make sure we respect them.

It’s now 2021, and globally, we are still dealing with the novel coronavirus and its fallout. Though vaccines have been approved, their rollout is taking time, so we are urged to continue practicing the precautions we followed throughout most of 2020. One of the unfortunate aspects of the virus and covid-19, the disease it causes, is the lingering health problems that some experience. In Italy, photographer Marco Carmignan spent some time at the Day Hospital Post-Covid-19 of the Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, which opened in April last year to treat covid-19 patients recovering from the virus and dealing with its long-term effects.

At the time Carmignan worked on this story, he said Italy had recorded more than 1.8 million coronavirus infections and 65,000 covid-19 deaths. Today, according to Johns Hopkins University, those numbers have risen to more than 2.1 million infections and more than 76,000 deaths. The number of people dealing with the long-term effects of the virus has increased as well.

Carmignan talks more about his project:

“Tiredness, breathing difficulties, memorization problems, severe pain in the joints, persistence in the loss of taste and smell, skin rash, hair loss, these are some of the symptoms that persist over the long term. Even months after infection with Sars-Cov-2, many people, although are negative to the swab, continue to have sequelae [conditions resulting from previous illness].

“The uncertainty about one’s state of health, about one’s future, caused by the disease before and by these long-term symptoms after, to which it is still difficult to give a real answer, lead to a deterioration in the quality of life and therefore can generate a post-traumatic experience.

“The world is now trying to understand the extent and duration of both immunity and long-term effects. The so-called ‘Post-Covid-19 Syndrome,’ also known as ‘Long Covid,’ is therefore configured. (How and why patients made Long Covid, F. Callard, E. Perego)

“The Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome opened a unique multi-specialist Day Hospital Post Covid-19 in April to take care of patients recovering from covid-19 and to try to shed light on the long-term effects of this new coronavirus.

“Structured on a standardized, three-entry cycle, patients undergo a series of medical visits for a complete checkup. From chest CT to spirometry [the measuring of breath], from blood tests to electrocardiography, from neurological to psychiatric visits.

“According to the doctors of the Gemelli Polyclinic, who have already published in several important international scientific journals (see here) on a basis of more than 600 patients, only 20 percent are able to obtain a complete recovery two months out from the disease, while the remaining 80 percent lives with various sequelae that lead to a significant deterioration in the quality of life.

“There is also a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorders, not directly dependent on the severity of the initial disease, such as those that arise after cataclysms, after earthquakes, after Sept. 11. People who have recurring nightmares, have flashbacks, have feelings that create a lot of problems.

Two rheumatoid arthritis drugs that suppress the immune system may help critically ill patients survive covid-19, providing a benefit even on top of the steroids that have been doctors’ main tools in treating the most serious cases of illness, according to a new study released Thursday before peer review.

British regulators cited the new results as they promptly approved the two drugs, tocilizumab and sarilumab, for use in patients in intensive care units. The relative risk of death was reduced by 24 percent when given to people within 24 hours of admission, the data showed.

“Today’s results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armory of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus,” Matt Hancock, health secretary for the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

“These are encouraging preliminary results,” said Jonathan Parr, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved with the clinical trial. Because the results represent patients in dozens of sites across six countries, he suggested they could be generalized to other locations.

David E. Leaf, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor and Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician, said the data were game-changing: “For ICU patients, I think it is a slam dunk that they should be given tocilizumab if it can be given early on.”

The results had an unusual path into the public domain. A week before Thanksgiving, one arm of a large clinical trial called REMAP-CAP was halted, through an announcement on Twitter, after a board monitoring patients in the trial had found that the drugs were so effective that it would be unethical to continue giving placebo to critically ill patients.

The clear finding came as a surprise to one of the investigators running the trial, after conflicting evidence on the utility of the drug tocilizumab from other trials. Most of the patients in the trial had already been on steroids, the inexpensive treatment that had shown to be successful at reducing deaths for people who require oxygen.

“We’re currently live in 290 sites around the world, and so there was no way to quietly whisper to 290 sites: ‘Stop randomizing to control in the immune modulation arm, but don’t tell anyone,’ ” said Derek Angus, chair of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and one of the investigators of the trial.

“We realized that we had to sort of make one sort of statement, even though damned if you do, damned if you don’t — we totally get people were frustrated,” he said. “We didn’t know all the data, but we did promise we’d get on top of the data as fast as possible.”

The data published Thursday showed that patients were given tocilizumab, sarilumab or usual treatment within a day of requiring organ support in the ICU — most typically patients who were on high-flow oxygen or a ventilator. Tocilizumab is manufactured by Roche under the label Actemra, and sarilumab is sold as Kevzara by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The drugs, which block certain immune molecules from triggering inflammation, are far more expensive than the cheap steroids already being given to those patients.

The list price of the dose of Kevzara used in the trial is about $3,600. The maximum dose used in the trial of Actemra currently carries a list price of $4,600, but the dose varied by patients’ body weight and could be given either once or twice. Bob Purcell, a spokesman for Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, said that the drug was not approved for use in covid-19 and the pricing might differ if it were approved to treat the illness.

The trial measured the success of the drug by the number of days patients didn’t need organ support, but found that much of the benefit came from preventing death, Angus said.

About 36 percent of patients died in the hospital who received standard care, while 28 percent died on tocilizumab and 22 percent died when given sarilumab. Patients treated with the drugs spent about a week less in the ICU, on average.

Angus said that earlier this week, when the final analysis of the results were ready, there was a discussion about what to do with them.

“We had this extensive conversation Monday night: should we put the results on the preprint server? The National Health Service of the United Kingdom felt like it’s time to give these drugs to patients — we can’t wait for this to go to a journal and peer review,” Angus said.

But he expects physicians in the US may be more conservative, at least waiting for a formal publication — especially given that official treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America currently recommend against giving tocilizumab to patients.

Clinical observations early in the pandemic suggested this class of drugs could curb the immune reactions in critically ill patients with covid-19 that sometimes led to fatal disease. Later, smaller clinical trials found mixed evidence in favor of using tocilizumab to reduce mortality. Two of them published in October, one conducted in France and the other in Italy, reported little clear benefit to patients.

“Other published randomized trials primarily enrolled hospitalized patients with less severe disease,” Parr pointed out, which may explain the difference between those results and these in intensive care patients.

And a large observational study of about 4,000 people, also published in October, suggested that tocilizumab helps critically ill patients. That study compared patients who received tocilizumab within 48 hours of being admitted to an intensive care unit against those who did not. Consistent with the new clinical trial, people treated with the drug were less likely to die.

Leaf, the senior author on the observational study, said the hospital where he works does not advise giving tocilizumab to any patient — but he has “been jumping up and down” to overturn that recommendation for the sickest patients. Leaf will be giving a presentation to the hospital in two weeks in favor of treating those patients with the drug. He said his “job just got a lot easier” with the release of these trial results.

The results may increase interest in a number of drugs that tweak the immune response by acting on different pathways. Angus said he envisioned that future trials could compare tocilizumab against multiple other immune modulating drugs, to see if any work better. The results highlight that while the virus has gotten most of the attention, fine-tuning the immune response may be the key to saving the lives of those facing the worst cases.

Wednesday’s storming of the U.S. Capitol did not just overshadow one of the deadliest days of the coronavirus pandemic — it could have contributed to the crisis as a textbook potential superspreader, health experts warn. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Thousands of Trump supporters dismissive of the virus’s threat packed together with few face coverings — shouting, jostling and forcing their way indoors to halt certification of the election results, many converging from out of town at the president’s urging. Police rushed members of Congress to crowded quarters where legislators say some of their colleagues refused to wear masks as well.

“This was in so many ways an extraordinarily dangerous event yesterday, not only from the security aspects but from the public health aspects, and there will be a fair amount of disease that comes from it,” said Eric Toner, senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Experts said that resulting infections will be near-impossible to track, with massive crowds fanning out around the country and few rioters detained and identified. They also wondered if even a significant number of cases would register in a nation overwhelmed by the coronavirus. As Americans shared their shock and anger at the Capitol breach Thursday, the United States reported more than 132,000 people hospitalized with the virus, and more than 4,000 deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus — making it the highest single-day tally yet.

“It is a very real possibility that this will lead to a major outbreak but one that we may or may not be able to recognize,” Toner said. “All the cases to likely derive from this event will likely be lost in the huge number of cases we have in the country right now.”

Trump devotees who flocked to the capital this week said they were unconcerned by the virus, belittling common precautions known to slow its spread and echoing the president’s dismissive attitude toward rising case counts. Trump had encouraged them to gather in defiance of his election loss: “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” he tweeted last month. “Be there, will be wild!”

Mike Hebert, 73, drove two days from Kansas to participate. Marching toward the Capitol on Wednesday with an American flag, he said he did not feel the need to wear a face covering.

“I am as scared of the virus as I am of a butterfly,” said Hebert, adding that he is a veteran who was shot twice in Vietnam.

Sisters Courtney and Haley Stone left New York at 11 p.m. to make it to the Capitol by morning so they could quietly counterprotest, draped in Biden gear. “Do you want a mask? I have one,” Haley, 22, asked a Trump supporter, only to be rebuffed.

“Oh, you believe in the mask hoax?” the woman replied.

Health experts predicted Wednesday’s events will contribute to an ongoing case surge in the greater Washington region. The average number of daily new infections in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia reached a record high Thursday, and current covid-19 hospitalizations in the District have risen 19 percent in the past week.

They also noted differences with other large gatherings such as Black Lives Matter protests. Fewer people wore masks during the Capitol protests and riot, they said, and crowds were indoors.

“If you wanted to organize an event to maximize the spread of covid it would be difficult to find one better than the one we witnessed yesterday,” said Jonathan Fielding, a professor at the schools of Public Health and Medicine at UCLA.

“You have the drivers of spreading at a time when we are bearing the heaviest burden of this terrible virus and terrible pandemic,” he said.

Calling in to CBS News Wednesday, Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) described her evacuation to a “crowded” undisclosed location with 300 to 400 other people.

“It’s what I would call a covid superspreader event,” she said. “About half the people in the room are not wearing masks, even though they’ve been offered surgical masks. They’ve refused to wear them.”

She did not identify the lawmakers forgoing face coverings beyond saying they were Republicans, including some freshmen. The Committee on House Administration says it is a “critical necessity” to mask up while indoors at the Capitol, and D.C. has a strict mask mandate.

“It’s certainly exactly the kind of situation that we’ve been told by the medical doctors not to be in,” Wild said.

“We weren’t even allowed to get together with our families for Thanksgiving and Christmas,” she said, “and now we’re in a room with people who are flaunting the rules.”

At least one member of Congress has tested positive since the mob spurred an hours-long lockdown. Newly elected Rep. Jacob LaTurner (R-Kan.) tested positive for the coronavirus late Wednesday evening, according to a statement posted on his Twitter account. It said he is not experiencing symptoms.

“LaTurner is following the advice of the House physician and CDC guidelines and, therefore, does not plan to return to the House floor for votes until he is cleared to do so,” the statement said.

Luke Letlow, a 41-year-old congressman-elect from Louisiana, died of covid-19 last month.

Any infections among members of Congress and their staff will be far easier to contact-trace than those among rioters, said Angela Rasmussen, an affiliate at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University.

“It certainly would have been easier if they were detained by Capitol police and identified, but testing suspects may be something to consider as law enforcement begins to identify them,” Rasmussen said in an email.

She noted that some may try to evade identification and criminal charges, and said she is deeply concerned for the households and communities they might expose.

“I think really rigorous contact tracing of people who are not identified as being present on Capitol grounds will not be possible,” she said.

On Christmas Eve 1958, 24-year-old Chinese pianist Fou Ts’ong boarded a plane from Warsaw to London. He had been studying in Poland after distinguishing himself there three years earlier at the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition, where he claimed third prize and an award for his interpretation of the Polish-born composer’s mazurkas.

Mr. Fou had obtained a visa to perform in Britain and had no intention of returning to communist China. His father, Fu Lei, a leading intellectual and celebrated translator of French literature, had been targeted in Mao Zedong’s Anti-Rightist Campaign against perceived critics of the communist government. If Mr. Fou returned, he would be forced to denounce his father and was likely to suffer persecution himself.

“All signs told me that I stood no chance, and I was especially scared because in this case it wasn’t only myself but also my father,” Mr. Fou said years later in an interview.

After arriving in London, where he lived for the rest of his life, Mr. Fou became one of the first Chinese pianists to rise to the front ranks of classical music. He never saw his father again, their contact limited to letters brimming with intellectual vigor, paternal concern and filial devotion that decades later were published in a best-selling volume in China.

In 1966, at the outset of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Mr. Fou’s father and mother, Zhu Meifu, hanged themselves in Shanghai after Red Guard paramilitaries invaded their home. “My anguish when I received the tragic news cannot be described,” Mr. Fou once told noted piano teacher Carola Grindea.

Mr. Fou, who continued performing until recent years, earning renown for the sensitivity he brought to the works of Chopin, Mozart, Schubert and Debussy, died Dec. 28 at a hospital in London. He was 86. The cause was covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, said his wife, Patsy Toh.

Mr. Fou’s recognition at the Chopin Competition in Warsaw — a symbolic victory for Chinese communists seeking to demonstrate their cultural achievements on an international stage — predated by three years Texan pianist Van Cliburn’s triumph at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, another event with geopolitical significance that resonated far beyond the concert hall.

Jindong Cai, a conductor and director of the U.S.-China Music Institute at Bard College Conservatory in New York, compared Mr. Fou’s defection to ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov’s decision to leave the Soviet Union for the West in 1974. To Mr. Fou’s admirers, he was a vital link between East and West, a performer who made them listen anew to musical works they had heard innumerable times.

“His Chopin or his Mozart is very special, very different from almost all other Western pianists,” Cai said in an interview. “Your instinct for the music [comes] from yourself, from within. . . . What you lived, what you experienced, influences your music.”

Fou Ts’ong was born in Shanghai on March 10, 1934. His name, he told the London Independent, meant “good ear.” “The Chinese character for it is composed of an ear, an open window and a heart,” Mr. Fou said. “It’s a natural and poetic way of saying, speak straight to the heart. As Mozart should. As all music should.”

Mr. Fou’s father had studied in France and produced Chinese translations of the works of Voltaire and Balzac, as well as the novel “Jean-Christophe” by Romain Rolland, based in part on the life of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven.

Fu Lei sought to instill in his son a profound appreciation for Western and Eastern cultural traditions and often counseled him, Mr. Fou recalled, that “first you must be a person, then an artist, and then a musician, and only then can you be a pianist.”

“My father was an extraordinary person, a Renaissance man of great humanism; that is the way I was brought up,” Mr. Fou said in an interview with Jessica Duchen, a classical music writer. “This kind of classical education even in my generation is very rare,” he continued. “My father, when he was teaching me Lao-Tse or Confucius, would also quote Aristotle or Plato or Bertrand Russell or Voltaire.”

Mr. Fou was drawn early on to Western classical music, which he heard on his family’s collection of records. He began piano lessons in 1940 and studied during and after World War II with Mario Paci, an Italian pianist and conductor who led the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra.

In his teens, Mr. Fou had a youthful dalliance with communism. He described himself as “making revolution all over the place, falling in and out of love all the time, drinking and playing bridge” until he settled into serious study of the piano.

“He was a rebellious, difficult pupil — a boy of that age, after all, does not find it easy to stick to hours of practice,” his father wrote in an essay relayed in an email by Cai. But Mr. Fou’s “love for music was so great that I found the severest punishment for slackness was to lock the piano and forbid him to play. He would look at the instrument and cry his eyes out.”

In their letters, the two men exchanged thoughts on music and on life. During his studies in Poland, he confessed to his father that he was lonely.

“He wrote back: ‘You could never be lonely. Don’t you think you are living with the greatest souls of the history of mankind all the time?’ ” Mr. Fou told Duchen. “Now that’s how I feel, always.”

Published in 1981 as “Fu Lei’s Family Letters,” the correspondence riveted Chinese readers.

“These letters were no dry sermons, but were instead the sole vehicle for intimate confessions of a father and a person of integrity at a time of universal hypocrisy and extreme political pressure,” Guangchen Chen, a professor at Emory University and longtime friend of Mr. Fou’s, wrote in an essay published in the volume “A New Literary History of Modern China.”

“The two were each other’s soul mates, finding consolation in the values they both cherished.”

Mr. Fou’s first marriage, to Zamira Menuhin, a daughter of the acclaimed violinist Yehudi Menuhin, ended in divorce, as did his marriage to Hijong Hyun. In 1987, he married Toh, a piano teacher at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Besides his wife, survivors include a son from his first marriage, Lin Siao of Shanghai; a son from his third marriage, Lin Yun of London; a brother; and a grandson.

Richard Curt Kraus, a professor emeritus at the University of Oregon and author of the book “The Party and the Arty in China: The New Politics of Culture,” wrote in an email that he considers Mr. Fou “a tragic figure, a brilliant musician whose career was impeded by political currents and family pressures beyond his control.”

“It took two decades and massive political changes for China to forgive him [for his defection], cutting Fou off from his natural audience base,” Kraus wrote. “Fou avoided becoming a pawn in cold war propaganda, but his politically charged status cannot have helped his career.”

Mr. Fou returned to China for the first time in 1979 and made more frequent trips back in the later years of his life to teach and perform. He gave his final public recital in Shanghai at age 80.

Of all the composers whose works he performed, Mr. Fou said he felt closest to Chopin, who died in 1849 in Paris and was buried there at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, although, on his request, his heart was returned to Poland. “He, too, was an exile,” Mr. Fou told the Independent, “with a feeling of longing, and anguish.”

As the United States marked another grim milestone Thursday with more than 4,000 covid-19 deaths reported in a single day, federal disease trackers said research suggests that people without symptoms transmit more than half of all cases of the novel coronavirus. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The findings, which came from a model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, demonstrate the importance of following the agency’s guidelines about wearing a mask and maintaining social distance, officials said. The emergence of a more contagious variant of the virus, first detected in the United Kingdom and discovered in eight U.S. states by Thursday, places the federal agency’s conclusion about how the virus is spreading in even starker relief.

“Those findings are now in bold, italics and underlined,” said Jay C. Butler, the CDC deputy director for infectious diseases and a co-author of the study published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

As disease specialists had forecast for months, the coronavirus is spreading with speed and ferocity in the new year, with Thursday’s single-day record for deaths underscoring the threat. In the past seven days, U.S. infections, hospitalizations and deaths have hit record highs. Cases reached a record 277,135 on Saturday. And by Thursday, more than 132,000 people were hospitalized in the nation with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

With more than 363,000 Americans dead since the start of the pandemic, the CDC’s most recent forecast predicts fatalities could stand between 405,000 and 438,000 by the end of January.

There is no evidence that the surge is being driven by the more contagious strain, known as B117, because if it were, it would have turned up in more of the genomic sequences analyzed by researchers in recent weeks. But health officials fear the variant could make a bad situation worse, driving more patients into hospitals and boosting the covid-19 death toll.

On Thursday, three states — Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Texas — reported detecting B117, joining California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and New York. Health experts have said they believe the virus variant may be present throughout much of the country. The variant is not believed to carry a greater risk of illness or death for individual patients. But experts have been alarmed at the likelihood it is more transmissible, which could result in more people developing covid-19 and, in turn, more deaths overall.

“We are in a race against time,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “We need to increase our speed in which we act so that we don’t allow this virus to spread further and allow this variant to become the dominant one in circulation. The clock is ticking.”

The need to slow transmission is especially evident in Los Angeles County, where Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Wednesday the region was in the midst of “a health crisis of epic proportions.” The county has reported more than 200 daily covid-19 deaths in recent days and has about 8,000 people hospitalized with covid-19. Statewide, California reported 583 deaths Thursday.

Describing herself as “more troubled than ever before,” Ferrer reiterated pleas for residents to follow public health guidance to try to slow the spread and ease the strain on hospitals.

“In Los Angeles County, we have doubled the number of people passing away each day, and this reality has upended all aspects of our health-care delivery system,” Ferrer said. “Our tragedy continues until we get it together to change our actions.”

At Methodist Hospital in Arcadia, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, administrators announced they had adopted crisis care guidelines. According to state guidelines, a hospital is at crisis care level when resources are scarce and the focus shifts to delivering the best care possible under the circumstances, forcing choices that may pose risk to patients.

Three other hospitals have notified the California Department of Public Health that they are approaching or entering that stage, which triggers the mobilization of regional and state resources to better care for patients. The agency did not identify the other three.

Methodist Hospital officials said they had activated a triage team, which includes doctors, community members, a bioethics specialist and spiritual care providers, to “make the difficult, but necessary decisions about allocating limited resources.”

Clifford R. Daniels, a senior vice president and chief strategy officer at the hospital, stressed that care had not been rationed as of Thursday and that all patients are receiving the care they need.

“We hope to never get there,” Daniels said. “It truly is the antithesis of every doctor and nurse in their training to deny care to somebody. We never want to be there. It almost makes me emotional to think in metropolitan Los Angeles in the 20th century that’s something that might happen.”

Administrators have had to redirect resources to accommodate 111 covid-19 patients, including 30 in intensive care, Daniels said. Some who are on ventilators are not in the ICU, where they would normally be treated, and instead are on other wards. Staffing is the biggest concern, he said; the hospital is paying nurses three times its normal rate and “looking at nooks and crannies” to try to find more.

The National Guard has provided five medics and a supervising nurse, Daniels said, while the state sent several more after the hospital moved to crisis care. Hospital officials believe the impact of Christmas and New Year’s Eve gatherings has yet to be realized, he said, and they’re bracing for a growing surge.

“If the demand for hospital services continues at the pace that it’s at now,” he said, “I fear that we may be facing a situation that was once unimaginable.”

The research the CDC released Thursday on how the coronavirus is spread comports with earlier estimates of the contribution of asymptomatic spread.

“It’s certainly confirmatory, but it’s nice to see confirmation,” said epidemiologist Richard Menzies, who directs the McGill International TB Centre in Canada and was not affiliated with this research. “These are pretty believable, solid results.”

Fifty-nine percent of all transmission came from people without symptoms, under the model’s baseline scenario. That includes 35 percent of new cases from people who infect others before they show symptoms and 24 percent that come from people who never develop symptoms at all.

Many factors influence how the coronavirus spreads. The researchers took an admittedly uncomplicated approach — Butler called it “a fairly simple mathematical model” — and used that to assess several scenarios, varying the infectious period and the proportion of transmission from people who never develop symptoms.

The model consistently predicted asymptomatic spread accounted for roughly half of viral transmission. But Muge Cevik, an infectious-disease expert at Scotland’s University of St. Andrews, argued some of the model’s assumptions are flawed.

Cevik also noted the study does not account for the environment where the spread occurs.

“Maybe asymptomatic transmission is important, but it may be much more important in long-term care facilities and households,” Cevik said. “That might mean that we need to do much more targeted testing for high-risk populations,” as opposed to mass screening.

Whether vaccines stop coronavirus transmission is not yet certain, and was not a scenario addressed in this model. “The data on the impact of the vaccines on asymptomatic infection are very limited,” Butler said, though he anticipates more information in coming months.

The clinical trials for two vaccines authorized by U.S. regulators in December concluded the vaccinations are highly capable of preventing symptomatic illness. But those trials did not determine whether vaccinated people are still able to spread the pathogen.

“If they were asymptomatic but equally contagious, then that’s going to have quite an impact on the epidemic,” Menzies warned.

As of Thursday, more than 21 million doses of coronavirus vaccine had been distributed to states, and just under 6 million had been administered, according to CDC data.

National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins acknowledged in an interview with The Washington Post this week that U.S. distribution got off to a “rocky beginning” but said he was “not totally surprised by that.”

“The next couple of weeks are going to be really critical to see how we can get this distribution system up and going more smoothly,” Collins said.

This spring, amid a panic over a shortage of ventilators to treat the anticipated surge in coronavirus cases, the Pentagon announced the purchase of $84 million worth of breathing machines from four companies. One of the ventilators, the SAVe II+, made by a small Plano, Tex.-based company called AutoMedx, stood out from the rest.

To start, the deal was for an upgraded version of the SAVe II that hadn’t even been designed yet, according to the company’s chairman. In addition, the existing $6,000 SAVe II machine, developed with military backing as a lightweight ventilator to keep wounded soldiers alive while being transported from the battlefield, had specifications far below the other three ventilators the Pentagon purchased. In a research study conducted for the Pentagon years earlier, the SAVe II had been declared unfit for use in a respiratory pandemic.

Defense Department medical workers who had been told to use the existing SAVe II device on covid-19 patients quickly came to the conclusion that it was ill-suited for the coronavirus pandemic, and began to voice their consternation to each other in emails that were shared with The Washington Post. One of the workers, who had been instructed to use the device if there were a surge of coronavirus patients, described it as “awful and under-powered.” Another raised concerns that using an ill-suited ventilator would “kill [covid-19 patients] just as fast as no ventilator at all.”

It’s unclear why AutoMedx, which had emerged from bankruptcy about six months earlier, received the no-bid emergency contract worth nearly $70 million for ventilators that, by every measure, were not suitable for covid-19 patients. AutoMedx eventually provided 11,200 ventilators at an average cost per ventilator of $6,274. Those ventilators are now in the country’s strategic reserve.

But who precisely authorized the contract remains unknown.

In mid-March, while hospitals were struggling to find ventilators to treat a surge of patients and U.S. cities were issuing stay-at-home orders, the White House began increasing spending in a scramble to prepare. Experts were predicting a widespread shortage of ventilators because covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, can cause patients’ lungs to fill with liquid, making ventilators necessary to save lives. The Defense Department’s coronavirus spending plan included $312 million in Defense Production Act spending to increase the national stockpile of masks, ventilators, test kits and other supplies.

As part of those preparations, the Department of Health and Human Services published a list of 18 specifications that the devices must meet. Representatives from HHS and the Defense Department wouldn’t say where those specifications came from, but the document appeared to be an exact copy of specifications that had been listed on the AutoMedx website for five years, down to the format and order.

James Evans, CEO of AutoMedx, said the specifications were modeled after a 2008 article in the academic journal Respiratory Care. But Richard Branson, the lead author of that article, told The Washington Post that the specifications bore no similarity to the contents of the article he authored.

The Respiratory Care article contains a chart with a list of minimum ventilator specifications for treating illnesses like coronavirus. Branson rejected the idea that the AutoMedx specs could be based on that article. “If you look at it, it’s not the same. It doesn’t look anything like that,” Branson said.

In any case, the Respiratory Care article doesn’t explain why the government’s document and the specs listed on the AutoMedx website were nearly identical. ""They didn’t even bother to change the orientation of it. If they were trying to be tricky, they could have at least started from the bottom and went down,” he said.

AutoMedx was not unknown to the U.S. government. Adrian Urias, an AutoMedx co-founder and current shareholder, advised the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force on ventilator purchases. AutoMedx’s current chief medical officer, Geoffrey Ling, was in charge of developing the company’s first ventilator, called the SAVe, while he served in the U.S. military.

AutoMedx is a private company, but it was founded with support and funding from the Pentagon’s research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. Ling’s boss at DARPA was Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician who now serves as assistant secretary of health and human services and is in charge of coronavirus testing for the Trump administration.

Urias did not respond to requests for comment. Stephanie M. Bialek, a spokeswoman for the Strategic National Stockpile, which is part of HHS, said Urias had no involvement in the AutoMedx contract. Giroir, through a spokesman, denied involvement in the AutoMedx contract.

In an interview, Ling said AutoMedx did not receive special treatment, to his knowledge, and said the company’s ventilator is a useful device for pandemic response. Air Force Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said the agency’s goal in purchasing AutoMedx devices was “to source as many ventilators as possible in the immediate future.”

“AutoMedx’s ventilators are developed to provide lifesaving mechanical ventilation when there is a lack of full-featured ventilators or a shortage of the highly trained staff necessary to operate them,” Evans said in a statement. He said the company spent 2½ months improving the motor and software of the device to better meet the demands of coronavirus patients.

Corey Russ, co-founder and CEO of Combat Medical Systems, the sole distributor for AutoMedx, said he agreed that the ventilator’s capabilities lag behind more robust systems used in hospitals, but he described the ventilator as being used on patients before they become so sick that they need a better ventilator. “You don’t go to battle with just a rifle or a shotgun. You go with a variety of weapons,” he said.

“I will tell you right now if I had to choose between a SAVe II ventilator and a full-featured one, I would take the full-featured one right now. They are incredibly wonderful pieces of medical equipment,” Ling said in an interview. As for the SAVe II, “It’s better than nothing.”

Ling said the simplified features of the AutoMedx ventilator have another benefit: Doctors who aren’t trained on ventilators can use it more easily. “The less-trained provider working with a full-featured ventilator can actually hurt somebody,” he said.

The SAVe, short for Simplified Automatic Ventilator, was created with funding from DARPA, the same government agency that created the precursor for the Internet, GPS satellites and the computer mouse. It was designed to be relatively inexpensive, lightweight, work on batteries and be operated by people with little medical training. The SAVe was on display at the 2007 DARPATech conference in Anaheim, Calif., a glitzy affair that was well attended by national tech reporters. With the promise of helping wounded soldiers make it from the battlefield to the hospital, the AutoMedx device received write-ups in publications such as Popular Mechanics.

The company was founded by Bill Wiesmann, a retired Army colonel turned entrepreneur who currently serves as chairman of the company, and Urias, an engineer who received a master’s degree in engineering from Harvey Mudd College in 2000.

The SAVe ventilator received approval from the Food and Drug Administration a month after the DARPA event and went into mass production in early 2008, according to a news release issued at the time by the company’s distributor at the time.

Giroir, who was director of science for DARPA at the time and oversaw the development of the SAVe, was also pushing the device as a solution to global pandemics, according to one person involved with the device who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Many victims of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 died because they essentially lost the ability to breathe, a syndrome known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). By placing virus victims on ventilators, doctors were able to save some patients via artificial breath. But ventilators are expensive and complicated to use, and Giroir thought the SAVe would be a less expensive “surge” ventilator to be used in the case of another pandemic, this person said.

In 2009, the H1N1 flu virus, which also caused ARDS, spread around an unprepared world. Partly in response to H1N1, DARPA funded a research study at the University of Washington aimed at determining whether SAVe ventilators would help patients with ARDS. The results, published in the academic journal Critical Care Medicine in 2011, came from making laboratory pigs very sick, after which they were placed on the SAVe ventilator.

The pigs on the SAVe quickly died, leading researchers to conclude that it wouldn’t be effective in a pandemic such as H1N1.

At the time, AutoMedx was also developing the SAVe II, a new ventilator that had not yet received FDA approval, so researchers at the University of Washington also studied that device. They concluded that the SAVe II, which received FDA clearance in 2014, was better than its predecessor but still inadequate for treating ARDS.

The SAVe II ventilators “were not developed, nor intended, to treat critically ill patients, such as those we are seeing with covid-19, who are often advanced in age and have severe respiratory infections, requiring higher air pressure concentrations to aid in oxygenation,” said DARPA chief of communications Jared Adams.

Evans, the AutoMedx CEO, said the purpose of the University of Washington study was not to test the efficacy of the company’s devices but to “test a ‘novel’ lung injury test protocol.” He said the technique used in the study is not typically used to evaluate ventilators. He said the SAVe II device “functioned as it was intended” in the study.

“I remember the study. We considered it pretty biased,” Russ of Combat Medical Systems said in an interview, referring to the results as “ambiguous.” He said the SAVe II was tested on coronavirus patients but did not provide details.

Treating the victims of a pandemic is different from treating soldiers on the battlefield, doctors say. First, most soldiers are young and fit, with healthy lungs. Second, their injuries are not necessarily to the lungs themselves. And third, they often need breathing support for only a short time before they arrive at a medical facility. Virus victims with ARDS often are older and have less resilient lungs. By the time they need help breathing, their lungs are ravaged and filled with fluid, requiring breathing support for days, weeks, even months. Keeping them alive is extremely complicated medicine.

In 2015, AutoMedx’s fortunes faded. It had partnered with Zoll, another ventilator manufacturer, to build a new ventilator. But the deal fell apart, and Zoll canceled its contract and asked for a refund, alleging that AutoMedx had failed to meet deadlines. AutoMedx sued and lost. It filed for bankruptcy in October 2018, emerging a year later.

When the pandemic hit, Evans quickly began pitching the SAVe II. “We’re getting ready to build 50,000 of these in the next 12 months,” he told Breitbart News on March 15.

Urias left AutoMedx in 2016 to join Tunnell Government Services, a consulting firm. He was appointed to work full time for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a division of HHS, as a subject matter expert on medical devices. Elleen Kane, a spokeswoman for HHS, confirmed that Urias volunteered to join the White House task force to advise it on ventilator purchases.

Giroir left DARPA in 2008 to serve as vice chancellor for research for the Texas A&M University System, according to his HHS bio. He continued to serve on the Defense Department’s Threat Reduction Advisory Committee after leaving DARPA.

On March 21, HHS issued a “request for information,” which was the government equivalent of a classified ad, calling on ventilator companies to quickly mass-produce and sell the devices to the government, in anticipation of a surge of virus cases that was expected to overwhelm hospitals. The RFI included the 18 minimum capabilities seemingly lifted from the AutoMedx website.

HHS spokeswoman Mia Heck said Giroir “did not have any role in the development of this document,” referring to the information request and the specs, and said Giroir had not seen it until The Post asked him to comment on it. The document was produced by HHS, but the agency’s representatives could not say who created it.

Andrews said the Defense Department had “no knowledge” of any involvement by Giroir in the decision to purchase the ventilator. Giroir has had “no contact with the program, company or ventilator development” since 2008, Heck said.

Urias “does not make decisions about procurements,” Kane said in a statement. “His role is limited to providing technical information about ventilators to federal staff, which mitigates any potential conflicts of interest. During the covid-19 response, he has continued to answer questions about the technical aspects of ventilators including the SAVe II ventilator.”

Combat Medical Systems quickly responded within the two-day deadline and was awarded a contract, along with several other ventilator manufacturers, to provide devices for the pandemic response.

Just days after the contract was signed, on April 1, a medical worker for the military sent an email to a group of military doctors around the country expressing concerns about using the SAVe II on covid-19 patients. According to the email chain, the devices were being pushed as a solution to a ventilator shortage. Many of the doctors on the email chain quickly concluded that it was ill-suited for pandemic victims. There were 28 medical personnel on the email chain. Four responded with concerns about the SAVe II. One doctor floated the idea that the ventilator might be used while transporting sick patients to a more capable ventilator.

Soon after that email chain, HHS concluded that the SAVe II was inadequate to treat covid-19 patients. Representatives for HHS declined to say whether the email chain influenced the department’s thinking on the matter. But rather than back out of the contract, the department requested that Combat Medical Systems make a new ventilator with improved features, according to Katie McKeogh, a spokeswoman for the department.

Even the new ventilator, dubbed the SAVe II+, was subpar for covid-19 patients, according to emergency room doctors interviewed by The Post.

“The SAVe II+ has fewer features and more limitations than other portable ventilators already in the national stockpile, including those we used in New York to support patients during the surge in March-April,” said Jeremy Beitler, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. “The lack of features limits the ability to adjust the ventilator to patient-specific needs,” he said.

“I wouldn’t call it a ‘covid’ vent,” said Robert Owens, a director at the medical intensive care at University of California, San Diego Health in La Jolla, CA.

Evans pointed to a September article in the medical journal CHEST that listed the average settings used on Covid-19 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Based on this data the SAVe II+ can ventilate the average COVID patient,"" he wrote in an email. However, the same article concluded the SAVe II+ was not suitable for treating critically ill covid patients. Rather, it could be used to transport patients or in lieu of a “bag valve mask,” which doctors can use to manually ventilate patients by squeezing a bag of air into their lungs. One other ventilator in the stockpile was also given that designation by the article’s authors.

Michelle Madej, spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency, said the agency originally ordered 2,500 SAVe II+ ventilators, but that it canceled 1,300 because they were no longer needed. But according to Bialek, the Strategic National Stockpile spokeswoman, HHS still ordered an additional 10,000 SAVe II+ ventilators. They have not been used on pandemic patients, she said, and are being stored in warehouses.

Harold Pollack is a professor at the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration and co-director of the University of Chicago Health Lab. In mid-November, my wife Veronica got a phone call she’d been dreading. Her brother Vincent was very sick, and had been taken by ambulance to our local hospital. Veronica raced there, where she found Vincent febrile and groggy, complaining of abdominal and chest pain. He was placed in the covid-19 unit and given oxygen while we awaited definitive test results.

Vincent is one of an estimated 7.4 million Americans with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Like roughly 600,000 others, he lives in a Community Integrated Living Arrangement, or CILA for short. Residents and the staff who care for them are at high risk during this pandemic. They should be given correspondingly high priority for covid-19 vaccines.

Americans can be proud that we no longer warehouse people with Down syndrome, Fragile X, autism and related conditions within institutions and state homes. But we cannot be complacent about the dangers they face.

Across the United States, it’s unclear where CILAs or sprawling complexes such as Ludeman stand in the vaccine queue. There is no national definition of long-term care facilities. States decide this on their own. Illinois’ covid vaccine plan makes little mention of IDD, though officials recently indicated that developmental centers and CILAs would receive priority. Other states took a similar approach, referencing disability and residence in a congregate setting in broad terms as factors in setting priority for vaccination, but neglecting to clarify where people with IDD stand. Nationally, caregivers, family members, CILA residents and staff are largely in the dark.

Vincent’s household includes five other men. Two use wheelchairs and require considerable help. Another is an older adult. Two staff members help Vincent prepare meals and perform housekeeping tasks, and assist the gentlemen with bathing, toothbrushing and daily medications. These workers are at risk — and thus Vincent is, too — because they are people of color living in south-suburban Chicago communities hammered by the pandemic.

Precautions to prevent the spread of covid-19 place people such as Vincent in danger of other physical and mental health harms. Many people with intellectual and developmental disabilities need services that can’t be performed over Zoom. Direct support work is hard and poorly paid, with frequent turnover. It’s important for a family to be able to check in on the care their relatives are receiving — or not receiving — during this difficult time.

The psychological impacts of isolation weigh on people with IDD. Window visits and Zoom are bewildering. Many are frightened by masks and other forms of personal protective equipment or experience physical distancing as a form of punishment.

Vincent has spent 50 years giving affectionate hugs. It’s hard for him and his peers to be vigilant about masks and physical distancing. While he’s been well-protected from covid-19, he’s bored and cooped-up. His day services are closed, recreational opportunities are halted. For more than a decade, he’s spent weekend afternoons and evenings catching up with our family friend Robin over dinner and a movie. That suddenly stopped.

Advertisement

Veronica — a nurse and medical social worker — has long monitored Vincent’s medical and dental appointments, sorted through his clothing and his room, observed him for injuries and inspected his feet, which are vulnerable to infection.

During the first few months of quarantine, our visits with Vincent were limited to short, physically-distanced doorway conversations. Routine dental, podiatry and primary-care visits were postponed. By summer, we were allowed brief visits in the garage, where he could share a snack and get a quick shave. Staff turnover continued apace. Telephone access to the house was spotty.

Veronica couldn’t regularly monitor his health. She couldn’t address routine problems as she’s always done. At the hospital, nurses discovered that his right big toe was ulcerated, bright red and grossly swollen.

Advertisement

We anxiously waited for Vincent’s test results. After three days, they came back — covid-negative. But his toe ulcerations had resulted in bacteremia, and — his doctors suspected — produced pneumonia that landed him in the emergency room. This wasn’t directly attributable to covid-19. But absent the pandemic, Veronica would have likely caught and addressed the ulcerations that may have made him so sick.

Vincent and his housemates need early vaccines that would allow them to resume healthy and safe lives. Those who care for them have done this hard work for months, facing risks hardly reflected in their modest wages. They earned a prominent place in the queue. So did family caregivers, particularly the estimated 1.3 million over the age of 60.

Vincent is out of the hospital, recovering in our home. The alternative was a skilled nursing facility. He would have been scared by this unfamiliar environment. We would have been, too.

He’s still with us. He wants to live here permanently. We don’t know that we can commit to that. We know that he and everyone who lives with and cares for him deserve to be safe.

The Trump administration allowed 15 poultry plants to increase slaughter line speeds during the pandemic, an action that boosts production and makes it more difficult for workers to maintain space between one another. It also appears to have hastened the spread of the coronavirus. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Now the outgoing administration is rushing to finalize a rule that would make the faster line speeds permanent and expand them to dozens of other poultry plants — a move at odds with views held by President-elect Joe Biden.

“Whether it’s cattle, whether it’s beef, whether it’s pigs, whether it’s chicken, they’re moving down that line faster and faster and faster to increase the profit rate,” Biden said last year. “People are getting sicker. . . . People are getting hurt. The very thing we should be doing now is making sure these people are protected, that they have space six feet apart, that they have shields around them. Slow the process up.”

Since 2018, the Trump administration has issued — or reissued — temporary waivers that grant permission to 54 poultry plants to increase line speeds. These plants are allowed to speed up lines from 140 to 175 birds per minute, a 25 percent increase.

They are also 10 times as likely to have coronavirus cases than poultry plants without the line-speed waivers, according a Washington Post analysis of data collected by the nonprofit Food and Environment Reporting Network (FERN). The Post analysis mirrors academic research that shows more coronavirus cases in counties with plants that have waivers to raise line speeds.

Workers say the fast line speeds make it difficult, sometimes impossible, for them to socially distance during their eight-hour shifts as they struggle to work faster. Most of these plants are also large, employing thousands of workers who work in tight quarters, creating conditions that can fuel the spread of the virus.

Meat plants have been among the most virulent hot spots during the pandemic. More than 51,000 workers in beef, hog and poultry plants have become ill from the coronavirus, with at least 347 dying after becoming infected, according to FERN data.

In response to questions from The Post, the USDA said a “direct link” between line speeds and the prevalence of coronavirus cases has not been established. The department also said it does not regulate worker safety and that, when determining line speeds, plants should follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, says there is no correlation among line-speed increases, problems with social distancing and coronavirus case rates.

Council spokesman Tom Super disputed plant employees’ contention that faster slaughter lines have forced them to work faster to keep up with production. He said the plants with waivers have added additional processing lines and workers, which unions dispute. Super also discounted research that shows a connection between line speed and the spread of the coronavirus.

Super pointed out in a recent retweet of the National Chicken Council that the pandemic has been a boon for the poultry industry: “Americans flock to chicken, the nation’s #1 quarantine protein,” the council wrote, citing a survey that shows chicken sales have grown by 20 percent over the prior nine months.

During the spring and summer, the industry took out full-page advertisements in newspapers saying the meat supply chain was on the verge of breaking and plants needed to stay open, and gave a similar message to the White House.

At George’s poultry plant in Springdale, Ark., which received a waiver in April to speed up lines, Juana Hernandez is one of more than 1,000 workers who help keep up with the growing demand. She said employees lunge over plastic dividers between work stations — intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus — to snatch back chicken carcasses, so they can carve them into wings, drumsticks and breasts.

They bump elbows with co-workers through the plastic sheeting as they attempt to keep up with the quickened pace. The CDC says plastic “should not be used as a replacement for maintaining at least 6 feet between workers.”

“We are inches from one another, knocking into each other through the plastic sheets,” said Hernandez, 38, who has worked at the plant for five years and removes bones from the carcasses. “I eat lunch in my car to protect myself because the break room is too crowded. We are on top of one another as we clock in. It’s scary. I worry about bringing it home.”

An image taken from video shows workers pressed together, bodies touching one another as they clock in and out for their shifts.

At the Springdale plant, 290 workers have been sick with the virus. George’s did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. The company website says it is the seventh-largest poultry producer in the nation and that “the well-being of our team members, customers, and consumers remains paramount.”

It also cited more than a dozen measures it says it has taken since March, many disputed by workers in interviews with The Post.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who introduced a bill in July to block line-speed increases, said the Trump administration has failed to “adequately protect meatpacking plant workers and in fact, has shamefully made conditions worse by keeping plants [with high infection rates] open and allowing them to increase line speeds.”

Booker said the last-minute push by the administration to permanently allow faster line speeds in poultry plants “is further evidence that they are willing to help corporate agribusiness prioritize profits over the health and safety of their workforce.”

The Biden transition team declined to comment on the proposed rule. However, at a town hall meeting in May, Biden said he was opposed to speeding up slaughter lines.

“No worker’s life is worth my getting a cheaper hamburger,” he said, pounding the table in front of him. “No worker’s life is worth that.”

Coronavirus spread in plants

Slaughter line-speed increases began in the late 1990s as a USDA experiment in 20 chicken and four pork plants. The plan was to study and document whether food safety standards could be maintained — or improved — at the same time the pace inside the plants picked up. Plants were also allowed to replace some USDA inspectors on the slaughter line with employees of the meat company.

In 2012, during the Obama administration, the USDA proposed to make the experiment a permanent option for plants that slaughter young broiler chickens, if they developed new food safety controls.

There was immediate blowback. The USDA received about 100,000 comments that raised concerns about worker safety, and the proposed increase in line speeds was removed from the final rule.

“The argument that finally got attention in the White House and changed things was how this would have a disparate impact on vulnerable Black and Brown workers who make up a majority of the workers in this industry,” said Debbie Berkowitz, who was chief of staff at OSHA and actively fought the line-speed provision.

More than 60 percent of meat plant workers are Black, Latino, Asian American or Native American, according to Labor Department data. About 37.5 percent are immigrants with limited or no English proficiency.

Illness rates for people who work in meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times as high as the average for all other industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although data shows illness rates in the plants have fallen, the Government Accountability Office in 2016 cited serious flaws with how the information is being collected and said it was not reliable.

The Trump administration began issuing waivers in 2018, ultimately giving dozens of chicken plants permission to run slaughter lines at 175 birds per minute — the exact rate the Obama administration rejected out of concern for workers.

Then the coronavirus spread through meat plants across the nation. An academic research paper that analyzed infection rates using data through mid-July found that counties with chicken plants that have waivers tended to have more coronavirus cases, on average, than those without waivers. The study was published in November in a top science journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“A faster production line can result in both workers locating in greater proximity to one another and increased difficulty in maintaining personal protective equipment and thus could contribute to conditions that increase the likelihood of viral transmission,” the study said.

This aligns with the Post analysis, which looked at coronavirus cases in poultry plants through mid-December. Coronavirus cases have been reported at 41 percent of the plants with waivers, compared with an outbreak rate of less than 4 percent for other poultry plants, according to the Post analysis of FERN data.

The USDA questioned the validity of the conclusions drawn from the research. The department also said many plants slowed line speeds during the pandemic, causing it to further question a connection between slaughter speeds and coronavirus cases.

When meat plants became hot spots in late March and April, local health departments began to shut them down, ordering testing, personal protective gear and social distancing. But the industry petitioned the federal government for help to keep plant doors open, and Trump said plant employees were “essential workers.” He issued an executive order in April that said it was critical for beef, pork and poultry plants to “continue operating and fulfilling orders to ensure a continued supply of protein for Americans.”

With the backing of the White House — and direct intervention by federal officials with local and state governments — meat plants with active coronavirus cases were able to reopen and remain open.

'Ram this rule through'

Days after Trump lost his bid for reelection, the USDA sent a proposed regulation to allow all poultry plants to increase line speeds to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, seeking its approval.

The odds of it being finalized before Biden’s inauguration appear slim, experts say, but past administrations have used methods to successfully push through such last-minute proposals, often referred to as midnight regulations.

“The fact that the agency sent this new proposed rule right after the election to the White House for clearance is a clear signal that they are trying to ram this rule through before the new administration can shut it down,” said Berkowitz, the former OSHA official who is now the worker safety director at the nonprofit National Employment Law Project. If the White House clears the proposal, the USDA pledged to have a period of public comment.

Biden’s transition team said last week that he would block actions taken by the Trump administration that had not yet become official. Even if the Biden administration doesn’t support a new rule to permanently increase line speeds, it’s unclear what will become of the 54 plants with waivers. Past administrations, including Obama’s, have routinely let them stand.

Employees at poultry plants, like the one where Juana Hernandez works, are concerned that the fast speeds and the tight quarters where they work will look the same as they did during the Trump administration.

Although Super, with the National Chicken Council, said faster slaughter lines “do not translate into faster cutup and debone lines,” a colleague of Hernandez said he can no longer “get a good grip” on the chicken since line speeds increased in the fall.

The 38-year-old, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution from management, said he used to process 36 to 38 chickens per minute but now must process 43 to 45 birds per minute. He is one of the employees knocking elbows with workers through plastic sheeting as he cuts wings off chicken carcasses.

In an interview in Spanish, the worker said he comes into the plant 30 minutes before the beginning of his 7 a.m. shift, hoping to avoid people in the crowd who may carry the coronavirus, which made his mother sick in July. She quit the plant this summer, he said, and never came back.

The quickened pace of his work means he comes home with more aches and pains than before. He recently went to the plant’s nursing station for a pain in his shoulder but was disappointed when the nurse, who was not present at the time he arrived, had to be called in and gave him 180 milligrams of ibuprofen. There was no massage, no review of his pain and no referral to a doctor. He has stopped going to the nurse and relies on vitamins from the local Salvadoran market to help.

“It’s inhumane,” he said. “We are worse than machines. At least machines get maintenance every so often. We don’t get anything.”

Andrew P. Feinberg is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Epigenetics at Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine, Engineering and Public Health. The covid-19 pandemic caught humanity by surprise, but we were lucky because we already had tools to solve it. This almost certainly will not be the case next time. The time to devise ways to improve our odds in battling the next outbreak is now.

The novel coronavirus behind covid-19 is nearly identical to the SARS coronavirus that swept Hong Kong in 2003 and similar to the related MERS virus from 2012. As a result, scientists already knew before the pandemic hit how to make a good SARS vaccine and what specific piece of its genetic information was needed to create it. When the sequence of the pandemic virus was published last January, it took only 48 hours to devise the formula for the current vaccine. The months after that were mostly devoted to vaccine production and testing.

Fighting the next virus might not be so simple — and there will be another virus. Bats and other species frequently shuffle coronavirus genes that can lead to human pandemics, and human exposure to such animals cannot be eliminated. Even though the next virus could be much deadlier — and could strike in a year or two or five — it is clear that people are unlikely to tolerate another round of stringent measures such as those employed this year to fight the pandemic’s spread.

There is a scientific principle of induction that states that with enough similar data from independent but related experiments, one can infer in advance what the solution will be to a new problem. So we need to practice designing vaccines for new coronaviruses.

Here is a suggestion for how to do that: Invest much more in vaccine platform technology that is quickly adaptable, like the two RNA-based vaccines released by Pfizer and Moderna. Those vaccines were so rapidly successful because they were able to swap out the last threat for the current one, making them much easier to develop and scale up compared with traditional vaccines.

Vaccines could also be developed for the four other known endemic coronaviruses — and even for influenza and other viral strains — causing seasonal respiratory illness in millions of people. The seasonal common cold alone costs the economy nearly $25 billion per year, as well as causing great disruption to families, schools and workplaces.

Starting this work soon is especially important because the newly developed coronavirus vaccines could begin to fail against mutations of the current virus.

Another source of urgency in this arena: the threat of a deadly influenza pandemic like the one that tore across the globe in 1918, killing tens of millions of people. Fifteen years ago, public health planners, including epidemiologist Anthony S. Fauci, called for comprehensive preparations for influenza pandemics. There are RNA strategies for rapid vaccine development for influenza and other viruses, but we need to invest more substantially in them now. We also need to understand and reduce the risk for people who are more susceptible than others to the ravages of these viruses, so as to develop medications to reduce their severity.

While Congress has allocated more than $18 billion to Operation Warp Speed for vaccine development and production, so far only a few billion dollars have been appropriated to National Institutes of Health for basic science research in covid-19. The production of a vaccine was obviously a great success, but that does not help us enough to prepare for the next pandemic.

How should this research be funded? The mechanism could be, in part, emergency funding to agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which have already played a huge role in nurturing the new coronavirus vaccines. The incoming Biden administration has also proposed an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health akin to the Defense Department’s DARPA project, which seeded development of GPS and the Internet. That could facilitate practical, lightning-fast growth of antiviral defense through government and private partnership.

I’ve been told by senior government and academic scientists that antiviral platform technology for future pandemics would cost about $3 billion per year in basic vaccine research. If another $2 billion were added for research on medications and testing, the cost would still be a drop in the bucket compared with the $16 trillion covid-19 may cost the U.S. economy. Consider it biological defense spending — though at less than 1 percent of conventional defense spending.

As bad as this pandemic has been, developing a vaccine for the next one could take twice as long, or more. And the disease could be twice as deadly, or worse. Let’s not wait for it to arrive before we act.

“Yes, but is it fair?” Chief Justice Earl Warren, known for his innate sense of justice, would lean forward and put that question to lawyers who laid out well-reasoned legal cases in oral argument. The same question occurred to me in light of two covid-19-related actions taking place in our nation’s capital. First, the recently announced decisions regarding who in Washington will be given priority access to the scarce coronavirus vaccine. Second, plans to hold pro-Trump rallies on Jan. 6 — gatherings that risk community spread of the coronavirus in an already pandemic-stricken region.

It’s clear that vaccination guidance provided by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and by Congress’s Office of the Attending Physician covers approximately the same geographic area.

But the vaccination priorities couldn’t be more disparate in a city where the racial disparity in covid-19 deaths between Black and White residents is the highest in the nation.

The city’s Phase 1A group for the vaccine gives top priority to District people serving on the front lines “who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials” and cannot work from home.

They include front-line public health staff, home health aides, and workers in acute-care hospitals, long-term-care facilities, emergency medical services, outpatient settings, and dental and pharmacy settings. Phase 1A also includes D.C. residents in skilled nursing facilities, assisted-living facilities and longer-term psychiatric inpatient programs.

An estimated 115,000 individuals are in the Phase 1A group.

Congress, in contrast, is pushing more than 1,000 Capitol Hill staffers to the front of the line. Members of the House and Senate began receiving the first of two coronavirus vaccine shots earlier in December.

Vaccine eligibility has been awarded to two staffers in every House member and senator’s personal offices. What’s more, the vaccine is being offered to four staffers of every committee chair and every ranking committee member. Congress considers these staffers to be “critical” and essential for “continuity of operations.” Most congressional workers are under 35.

As for D.C. law enforcement and public safety workers, teachers, childcare providers, grocery store and public transit workers, and Postal Service workers? They are in the city’s Phase 1B — the second group. They must wait until the 115,000 in Phase 1A are taken care of, and for when enough vaccine becomes available.

But is it fair?

Are staff members of, let’s say, congressional small business committees or worker bees for House Republicans such as Louie Gohmert (Tex.) and Jim Jordan (Ohio) — who on Jan. 6, hellbent on trashing democracy, plan to try to overturn the result of a presidential election when Congress convenes to formally count the 2020 electoral college votes — more essential to the functioning of society than mail carriers, firefighters or grocery-store cashiers?

Advertisement

Yet, D.C. folks on the front lines must stand and wait, in hopes they don’t contract the deadly virus before more vaccine arrives.

The city’s Phase 1B category also includes D.C. residents who are 75 years and older.

The city estimates about 110,000 individuals are in Phase 1B. Because of my age and underlying health conditions, Phase 1B is where I belong.

I hope and deserve to be the last person in line.

I am not critical to the functioning of this city. The operation of the District ― or, for that matter, The Post — can get along without me very well.

My physical presence is not required anywhere in this city, except maybe at home — and that is when my wife, Gwen, is in a forgiving mood. Most of my in-person interactions these days involve our two black Labs — Ronnie and Buster — if they are in good moods. I know my part.

But so, too, should the crowd that President Trump has incited to descend upon Congress as it meets to certify the electoral results. “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” tweeted Trump. He followed that up with a Wednesday tweet to supporters, “JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!”

If they behave like those at two previous pro-Trump gatherings, social distancing and mask-wearing will be treated as afterthoughts, with shouting, chanting and coughing as plentiful as Trump-mania.

No matter, apparently. D.C. police, emergency services and public-safety workers must be on hand, exposed to infections and raging protesters, and away from the communities they have sworn to protect — because of the scheming rage of Donald Trump.

Is that fair?

MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors have asked the judge overseeing the criminal case in George Floyd's killing to delay the scheduled trial from March to June, citing concerns that the trial and expected protests could become a ""superspreader event"" amid the ongoing risks of the coronavirus. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In a memo filed Thursday, Matthew Frank, the assistant attorney general of Minnesota, who is leading the prosecution’s case, said the state “stands ready to try this case” on the scheduled March 8 trial date. But he argued that a “three-month continuance is in the best interests of public health,” noting that the increased availability of coronavirus vaccines for Americans in the coming months is likely to “substantially lower” the risk of transmission among those expected to gather for the trial.

“This high-profile trial is unique, and it poses unique health risks,” Frank wrote, pointing to the “larger than usual number of participants” inside the courtroom — including the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd’s killing, their lawyers and dozens of witnesses — as well as the danger of community spread among “large public demonstrations.”

“The costs of a covid-related interruption of the trial are likely to be far higher here than in an ordinary trial,” Frank wrote.

The motion comes as Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill has scheduled a Jan. 7 hearing on previous defense motions to delay the trial. Attorneys for former officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao accused prosecutors earlier this month of slow-rolling the handoff of key evidence and of turning over material they said was disorganized and riddled with technical issues — claims that prosecutors deny.

Robert Paule, an attorney for Thao, has asked Cahill to delay the trial until July. Eric Nelson, an attorney for Chauvin, did not cite a specific date in his request for a delay but pressed for “relief the court deems just.”

Earl Gray, an attorney for former officer Thomas K. Lane, quickly filed an objection to the state’s motion to delay the trial over coronavirus risks. He argued that prosecutors, “although all powerful, cannot see into the future” and reminded the court that jury questionnaires have already been sent out.

In their motion Thursday, prosecutors filed an affidavit from Ezekiel Emanuel, a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board, outlining the estimated rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the months ahead and warning of the health risks should the trial move forward in March.

“Even with social distancing measures and mask protocols, an in-person trial in March 2021 that attracts a large number of people who are indoors for prolonged periods of time with public speaking is likely to create a substantial risk of covid-19 transmission,” Emanuel wrote. “Given the high incidence of covid-19 in the community, the trial in this case could become a superspreader event.”

Cahill has already enacted some coronavirus safety protocols. Last month, he broke Minnesota court precedent to allow audio and visual coverage of the upcoming trial, citing the limited number of people who will be allowed inside the courtroom because of social distancing.

He has also moved to begin the process of jury selection weeks earlier than usual, as the court seeks to determine whether the officers charged in Floyd’s killing can receive a fair trial in Minneapolis.

Floyd died May 25 after being handcuffed and pinned facedown on a South Minneapolis street as police investigated a 911 call about a counterfeit $20 bill that allegedly had been passed at a convenience store. Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as the 46-year-old Black man repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe. Floyd lost consciousness and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis force, was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, while the other officers at the scene — Thao, Lane and J. Alexander Kueng — were charged with aiding and abetting murder. All four were fired by the Minneapolis Police Department.

Prosecutors have repeatedly sought to block the trial from being broadcast, citing concern about the effects on court proceedings and witnesses. It’s unclear if they will press the judge to reconsider coverage if he grants the motion to push the trial into the summer.

Medical centers in the United States are balking at providing the only treatment for covid-19 that aims to keep people out of the hospital, leaving hundreds of thousands of doses of the medication unused. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Monoclonal antibodies — described as “unbelievable” by President Trump, who received the treatment this fall — are designed for patients newly diagnosed with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, who have a high risk of developing complications and becoming seriously ill.

But for hospitals already strained by a surge of covid-19 cases, the outpatient pharmaceutical treatment presents a major logistical challenge as exhausted staff scramble to care for patients and race to inoculate front-line workers with the first coronavirus vaccines.

As of Wednesday, the federal government had allocated 550,000 doses to states and territorial health departments, which had distributed 378,000 doses to health-care facilities, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. But only 20 percent of the supply had been used, HHS said.

Some hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, have declined allocations, while others have simply not used the antibody treatments. The slow rollout reflects myriad challenges involving the intravenous drugs, which are made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly and were granted emergency use authorizations in November.

The treatments must be given within 10 days of the onset of symptoms — a time when many patients are hunkering down at home, hoping to get better. Clinics and hospitals need to set up a special infusion space to keep contagious patients away from other people, including cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Nurses must be pulled from other duties to monitor patients for the two-hour sessions, in part to watch for rare allergic reactions.

Questions about the drugs’ effectiveness further complicate matters. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends against routine use of the drugs, citing a lack of evidence, and the National Institutes of Health says “insufficient data” exists to recommend for or against the medications. Clinical trials of the two antibody treatments continue.

“Right now, we are swamped with both covid and non-covid patients,” said Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and physician at the Cambridge Health Alliance, a health-care system in the Boston area that does not offer the treatment.

“The last thing we want is to use our resources for an unproven treatment,” said Cohen, who works at the system’s Somerville, Mass., clinic.

The lagging demand was not anticipated by experts who warned of a shortage, not a surplus, of antibody treatments. In clearing the products in November, the Food and Drug Administration said they could be used broadly for high-risk covid-19 patients, a group that includes millions of older people and those with medical conditions such as diabetes. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, which aims to develop drugs and vaccines for covid-19, ordered 1.2 million doses for delivery by the end of January, said Janet Woodcock, leader of Operation Warp Speed’s therapeutics arm.

Demand was expected to surge when Trump made a laudatory video after receiving the Regeneron medication and promised to make the antibody treatments free to patients needing them. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson were treated with monoclonal antibodies after developing covid-19. Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani told the New York Daily News he received the Regeneron drug. Some people predicted only VIPs would get access to the drugs.

But many patients and doctors don’t know much about the medicine and have not been asking for it, officials say. In an appearance on CNBC on Dec. 15, HHS Secretary Alex Azar lamented a surprising surplus of the medications, partly because “people are waiting too long to seek out the treatments.” Such delays, he warned, meant that, for some patients, “it may be too late in order to get the benefit of these antibody treatments that beat back the spread of the virus.”

Experts say states’ experiences vary, with some, including Louisiana, Nebraska and Texas, embracing the treatment and others showing little interest. HHS has predicted that the pace will pick up as more facilities, including nursing homes, begin administering the drugs and mandatory reporting begins early in January.

Monoclonal antibodies are proteins created in the laboratory to mimic the human immune system. The treatment works by imitating natural defenses instead of waiting for the body to mount its own response and make it harder for the coronavirus to infect human cells.

The Lilly product, called bamlanivimab, is a single antibody cleared by the FDA on Nov. 9. Regeneron’s cocktail, made up of two monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, was authorized less than two weeks later.

At UCLA Health, four or so patients a day are being given the antibody treatments, according to Tara Vijayan, an infectious-disease specialist there. “Implementation has been difficult to say the least,” with lively debates about how to allocate space and staff, she said. “It took a month of constant meetings for a drug that doesn’t have a lot of data.”

Still, she said, with intensive care units reaching capacity amid a covid-19 surge in Los Angeles, “if there are ways to reduce that, we will try it.”

Operation Warp Speed’s Woodcock acknowledged the difficulties of administering the antibody treatments for hospitals under stress from a raging pandemic. “It is not easy,” she said. “These hospitals are being hammered.”

But, she said, the medications could ease hospitals’ burdens by reducing admissions. Although the clinical trials for the treatments are not large, she said, “the totality of evidence is very convincing” that the drugs can keep people out of the hospital.

“This is the only thing we have for outpatients, other than just telling them to stay home and isolate,” she said. She added that the government is planning steps to increase uptake of the treatments.

Mark McClellan, a former FDA commissioner who has been working to increase use of the drugs, said: “If it were my mom, I would want her to get it.”

But many doctors remain skeptical or undecided. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious-disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said his hospital is offering the treatment to high-risk patients in clinical trials and outside of studies. He said he was glad Regeneron and Lilly plan to complete their trials, saying additional data is needed.

“We are still trying to get a definitive answer to how beneficial this is” and which patients are helped, he said.

One of the biggest obstacles for clinics is identifying patients within the 10-day window during which the drugs are effective. Karen Bloch, an infectious-disease doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the hospital uses coronavirus test results to identify eligible patients.

“We look at the test results and reach out to the folks who fit,” said Bloch, who added that the medical center is providing the treatments to 18 to 22 patients a day.

To keep covid-19 patients apart from other patients, Vanderbilt created a free-standing area with walls, heat and light in what used to be a parking garage. Bloch said she doesn’t know whether the treatments are helpful, because she is not conducting a clinical trial.

“But from patients, we are hearing good reports,” she said.

Tufts Medical Center in Boston has been offering the treatment for about a month in its new Respiratory Infection Clinic, said Helen Boucher, an infectious-disease specialist. “The demand has not been overwhelming,” she said, “but it’s still early days.”

Woodcock said the government plans to ensure the drugs are distributed to a wider range of facilities, including home-infusion companies and other sites. CVS Health is running a pilot project to provide the medicine at home. Woodcock said she also plans to talk to groups such as the American Medical Association and to highlight “early adopters,” including the Mayo Clinic and the state of Maryland, which has set up regional antibody infusion centers, including in Baltimore’s convention center.

Lilly said it is working with hospitals and other providers to try to ensure that patients who need bamlanivimab can get it. The company said infusion centers are being created in several health facilities and repurposed public spaces to provide the treatment during off hours.

Even as coronavirus vaccines steal the spotlight, McClellan said, monoclonal antibodies will be needed “for people who don’t take the vaccine, or don’t mount an immune response when they do. This is something we need to set up and work out for the long term.”

Dawn Wells, an actress best known as the pigtailed Kansas farm girl turned castaway on the 1960s sitcom “Gilligan’s Island,” died Dec. 30 at an assisted-living facility in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 82. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The cause was complications from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, said a spokesman, Harlan Boll.

A drama major who was crowned Miss Nevada in 1959, Ms. Wells parlayed her pageant success into a show-business career. She made scores of screen and stage appearances over five decades, but none as memorable as her role as Mary Ann on the CBS show about a motley group of tour-boat passengers marooned on an uncharted South Pacific island.

“Gilligan’s Island,” which aired from 1964 to 1967, claimed an enduring place — as inexplicable as it was irrefutable — in pop culture. The show was dismissed by reviewers and even some network executives as escapist filler on the TV schedule, lowbrow and slapstick. But it became one of the most popular programs ever in reruns, spawning occasional TV movies that reunited most of the original cast.

Every week, viewers followed the misadventures of the goofy first mate Gilligan (Bob Denver) and his buffoonish Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.); the haughty millionaire couple Thurston and Lovey Howell (Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer); a scientist known as the Professor (Russell Johnson); a sultry movie star named Ginger Grant (Tina Louise); and Mary Ann Summers, the girl-next-door whose wardrobe of choice was short shorts and midriff tops.

“It’s not my ego talking, but Mary Ann wasn’t just a silly and sweet ingenue,” Ms. Wells observed in her 2014 self-help book, “What Would Mary Ann Do?: A Guide to Life,” written with Steve Stinson. “She was bright, fair-minded and reasonable, and I like to think that’s what I brought to her. . . . Sherwood Schwartz, the show’s producer and creator, was smart enough to put her in short shorts so you wouldn’t think of her as your bossy sister.”

The presence of Ginger and Mary Ann — the first a sexpot, the second a wholesome beauty — gave rise to an ongoing debate over who on the show best represented the male fantasy of womanhood. Ms. Wells embraced the rivalry.

“As a matter of fact, I’ve got a T-shirt that’s a ballot that says ‘Ginger or Mary Ann, the ultimate dilemma,’ ” she told the Vancouver Sun in 2014. “You can go anywhere and say ‘Ginger or Mary Ann?’ You don’t have to say what show it is. Everybody gets it. And I always win.”

Dawn Elberta Wells was born in Reno, Nev., on Oct. 18, 1938. She attended the all-women’s Stephens College in Missouri with plans to study chemistry but developed an interest in the arts and transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle.

She graduated in 1960, was Nevada’s representative in the 1960 Miss America contest and gave herself two years to make a mark as an actress — or otherwise return to college for medical-school training.

After small roles on TV series such as “77 Sunset Strip,” “Surfside 6” and “Hawaiian Eye,” Ms. Wells found herself up against another obscure actress for the role of Mary Ann. “That’s the only time I could beat Raquel Welch out of anything,” she later quipped to the Associated Press.

She married and divorced her agent, Larry Rosen, in the 1960s. Survivors include a stepsister.

Struggling to find challenging work after “Gilligan’s Island,” Ms. Wells turned to stage productions, often appearing in Neil Simon plays. She also had a featured role in the serial-killer movie thriller “The Town That Dreaded Sundown” (1976).

She told the New York Times that certain doors were closed to her, one of them being a staging of the Eve Ensler play “The Vagina Monologues.” “Are you out of your mind?” she recalled producers asking. “Mary Ann?” (She was hired for a touring production.)

In the late 1980s, Ms. Wells created a now-defunct clothing line for the elderly and disabled called Wishing Wells. For a time, she lived in Idaho and served as chief executive of the nonprofit Idaho Film and Television Institute, an actor’s workshop that shuttered in 2009.

She did not distance herself too much from her signature TV part, lending her name to “Mary Ann’s Gilligan’s Island Cookbook” (1993). She also starred in a short film, “She’s Still on That Freakin’ Island” (2015), but sporting jeans rather than her earlier skin-baring look.

“I actually have a pair of the original shorts from the show,” she told writer Nick Thomas, “but I’m not sure if they would fit me now.”

A grandma lost her brother and niece to covid-19, barely surviving the disease herself. A father lost his teenage daughter to gunfire and fears the killing has been forgotten. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight And a cook who lost his job due to the pandemic now skips meals to make the food stamps last. African Americans in the nation’s capital have always suffered more than Whites during crime waves and economic downturns. But 2020 has been a particularly devastating year for Black D.C., magnifying racial inequalities that were already among the worst in the nation.

Between the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in homicides, nearly 1,000 lives were lost this year in the District. Almost 80 percent have been Black, even though African Americans now make up less than half of the city’s population.

Some Black families have been struck by both the pandemic and gun violence, the twin tragedies compounding already immeasurable pain.

Abu Baker Bangura lost his 18-year-old son, Richard, in mid-August after the college-bound honor student was shot two blocks from home in Northeast Washington — so close Bangura heard the gunfire. Two weeks after the burial, Bangura found himself attending another funeral — for an uncle who died of covid.

“This has crushed us,” Bangura said.

And there have been other losses. Black unemployment nearly doubled in D.C. during the first few months of the crisis, while children of color have endured worse educational setbacks than their White classmates.

And amid demonstrations for racial justice, Black D.C. residents have watched the capital — a place long celebrated as Chocolate City — become a magnet for groups with ties to white nationalism. During an election protest earlier this month, members of the Proud Boys stole two “Black Lives Matter” signs from African American churches, smashing one and setting the other on fire.

“Just when you think things can’t get much worse,” said Marie C. Johns, who worked in the Obama administration and belongs to Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal, one of the churches, “you have people spewing hate and defiling a place that is absolutely sacred to my family and others, a place built by our recently freed ancestors.”

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District’s nonvoting member in Congress since 1991, said she couldn’t remember a worse period in her 83 years.

“It’s a very dark time,” said the native Washingtonian. “Everybody is waiting for 2020 to be over.”

'It is a beast'

Loretta Simmons lost her brother to covid in March, when he collapsed yards from the doctor’s office, unable to breathe.

Two weeks later, her daughter and grandson came down with coughs and fevers.

Soon, Simmons also fell ill. The 71-year-old from Northeast Washington spent April on a ventilator. A few days after she was discharged, her niece died of the disease.

“This thing has hit my family tremendously,” said Simmons, who is still suffering from breathing issues and brain fog eight months later. “It is a beast.”

Across the country, African Americans are almost three times as likely to die of covid as Whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the trend is even starker in the District, where African Americans have died of covid at a rate six times higher than Whites.

Of the 786 lives the disease has claimed in the capital this year, roughly 75 percent of the victims have been Black, even though African Americans make up 46 percent of the city’s population.

Some of the dead were public figures: an attorney in the mayor’s office; a groundbreaking law professor who helped create the Peace Corps; a pioneering psychiatrist renowned for her work with addicts and AIDS patients; a photographer who risked his life to capture the Freedom Rides.

Others were less renowned but no less mourned: a beloved teacher’s aide; a 105-year-old born before the 1918 flu pandemic; and a psychiatric hospital patient who was estranged from her family but whom caregivers considered a “gem.”

For Howard Croft, it began in late May with a fever after a trip to his oncologist. His wife, Cynthia Kain, thought the 78-year-old civil rights activist and educator might be having a reaction to the steroids that were part of his cancer treatment. But then his fever spiked and a trip to the hospital turned into a month-long fight for his life.

Croft was given remdesivir and transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he was put on a ventilator. After two weeks, something happened that seemed scripted by the scrappy, self-made storyteller: He came off the breathing machine.

“I was so happy,” Kain recalled. “I thought he had turned the corner.”

But covid had ravaged his lungs, and within a few days it was clear something was wrong.

“He just kept going downhill,” Kain said. “Down, down, down.”

The call she was dreading came at 3 a.m. on June 20. Kain, who had just recovered from covid herself, caught an Uber from their home in Southeast Washington to Baltimore. Their daughter drove down from Providence, R.I.

They played one of Croft’s favorite songs — Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” — as the man who’d spent his life working for change let go.

It hurts Kain to see the disease that claimed her husband ravage the Black neighborhoods he so loved.

“Why is all this visited on our community?” she asked. “Why are we having to bear all this terrible weight of covid and gun violence and joblessness? It feels really unfair.”

'They took my baby'

Saige Ballard was standing outside a Capitol Hill house party, talking to a young man in the June moonlight, when someone approached from the street and opened fire.

Bullets struck Ballard in her upper body. The 18-year-old had returned to her parents’ home in Northwest Washington this spring after covid cut short her freshman year of college. She was giddy about moving into her own apartment at Georgia State in the fall. Her father and older brother, both chefs, had begun teaching her how to cook.

Instead, she was pronounced dead at MedStar Washington Hospital: the 70th homicide victim in what would become the bloodiest year the District has seen in more than 15 years.

As with the pandemic, African Americans have suffered the brunt of the bloodshed. Of the 198 homicides in the capital this year, nearly all were Black, according to police data. At least seven were Hispanic and two were White.

Six months after he and his wife rushed to the hospital only to find they were too late, James Ballard fears that his only daughter — who would have turned 19 on Nov. 21 — is being forgotten amid a flood of killings. Her death received little media coverage, and police have no suspects.

Detectives tell her father they are working hard to find her killer. But Ballard doesn’t understand why the mayor didn’t hold a news conference for his daughter, as she did for a 1-year-old slain earlier this month.

“It’s like Saige is just another case,” he said. “Because gun violence is just so prevalent in the District.”

The city’s Black homicide victims range from an 11-month-old baby to an 81-year-old Korean War veteran. At least 18 were teenagers.

Christopher Brown was playing video games with his younger brother and grandma in August when a friend invited the 17-year-old to a cookout advertised on social media. The event had swelled to hundreds of people by the early hours of the next day, when gunfire erupted.

Brown’s grandma awoke to her phone ringing.

“Poppy got shot,” a friend told her, using Christopher’s nickname.

Patrice Brown began calling emergency rooms in search of the boy she’d raised like a son. Someone at UM Prince George’s Hospital Center told her the ER had received a young patient with no identification and a fatal bullet wound to his chest.

The teen had “Patrice” tattooed on his arm.

“They took my baby from me,” she said of the Aug. 9 shooting, which injured 21 others.

Christopher left behind a young son and a shattered family.

For Thanksgiving, Patrice made Christopher’s beloved cornbread, which the teen called cake. “As soon as I got everything fixed, I broke down,” she said. “Because he’s not here.”

Amber Wilson also spent the holiday in mourning. Her daughter, a 31-year-old dance instructor named Noelle, had been found shot to death six weeks earlier in an alley in Anacostia.

“My daughter was always the fashionista,” Wilson recalled with a laugh. “She’d come over for Thanksgiving, flying through the door fashionably late, saying, ‘I’m here.’ ”

This year, Wilson made Noelle’s favorite foods once more. Then she took the plate of ham, sweet potatoes and corn pudding to her daughter’s grave and ate with her, one last time.

'Come home'

For Tyrone Parker, the surge in homicides was a call to action. The 74-year-old helped found the Alliance of Concerned Men in 1991 — when the city suffered a record 482 killings — two years after his own son was slain.

Parker and his fellow “violence interrupters” have spent decades trying to defuse tensions in some of the city’s most dangerous areas. But lately, bloodshed has crept close to his organization.

The mass shooting that claimed Christopher Brown in August left bullet holes in the Alliance’s sign. And a young female volunteer was slain in October.

The Alliance was conducting a workshop with young men who’d lost relatives to gun violence in early December when the sessions suddenly came to a halt: Someone in the office had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Parker and his wife, Yvonne, had been sick with what they thought was the flu. But when he took her to the hospital, doctors told them she had covid. Parker tested positive for the coronavirus two days later.

Yvonne was put on a ventilator, but seemed to be improving. When Parker spoke to her on Dec. 7, the fastidious former NASA employee — who proudly displayed a photo with Neil Armstrong at their home in Temple Hills, Md. — reminded her husband of 43 years to collect the mail.

Parker told her he had hung the Christmas wreath on the door and put out the poinsettias, just how she liked.

“I told her I was waiting for her to come home,” he recalled.

She died the next day.

'I'm hungry'

Julius Booker still dreams of steak.

A good slice of meat was an occasional benefit of being a cook at a restaurant in Chinatown, where the prime rib cost almost twice his hourly wage.

The job had been a dash of good fortune in a life otherwise untouched by it. The 56-year-old former construction worker had been on disability since slipping two disks in 2013. Chopping vegetables was easier on his back and paid the bills.

But then the stores in Chinatown began shutting in March, and his boss told him to file for unemployment.

“He said when things got better they’d call me back,” Booker recalled. “But things haven’t got better.”

Instead, Booker, a proud man who learned to cook at a culinary school that feeds the homeless, now fears joining their ranks. He went on food stamps for the first time but they don’t stretch far enough, so he’s taken to skipping meals. He’s three months behind on rent and has no answer when his wife says, “Baby, I’m hungry.”

“I’m not used to hearing that,” he said.

Black unemployment in D.C. soared from 11 percent to 18 percent in the second quarter, according to the Economic Policy Institute. White unemployment went from 2 to 4 percent.

“We’ve seen people lose their first job, then their second job,” said Kim Ford, the president and CEO of the nonprofit Martha’s Table, which is handing out 2,000 bags of groceries a day. “The scariest thing is a lot of these jobs are not coming back.”

Martha’s Table and other charities have begun providing hard-hit families with stipends of $1,100 a month for five months. Many families use the money to buy food or pay the rent, Ford said, but at least two used it to bury a loved one.

Many nonprofits serving primarily African American neighborhoods are struggling to survive — their fundraisers canceled — just when they are needed most, said Philip Pannell, executive director of the Anacostia Coordinating Council. He worries about the city’s Black children; 1 in 4 were living in poverty last year, and the education achievement gap between White students and those of color is bound to get worse.

“The community is going to feel this for years to come, because our kids are just drastically falling behind,” said Pannell. “We were having a problem with school attendance and the high dropout rate . . . before the pandemic struck. This just made the situation that much worse.”

For Booker, each month without work only brings more debt. He and his wife receive around $1,600 a month in disability and unemployment, Booker said. But rent plus utilities for their one-bedroom home in the Carver-Langston neighborhood often pushes $1,200. What’s left over isn’t enough to pay for food, cellphone service and their one remaining comfort: television.

The Salvation Army rescued him from a $400 overdue gas bill this summer. And Pepco recently agreed to keep the lights on if Booker paid the $343 he owed in monthly installments.

A spate of homicides has rocked Carver-Langston this year. And ever since a neighbor moved out after being mugged this summer, Booker has taken to carrying a pocketknife when he walks to the grocery.

“This has been a hard year, a very hard year, and I’m powerless over it,” he said. “I didn’t do nothing to be in this bind, but there’s nothing I can do to get out of it until everything else clears up.”

He wants to believe that next year will be better, but the signs are ominous. He woke up one recent morning to find a little black bird in his living room. Relatives told him it was an omen of death.

Booker opened the window and carefully shooed the animal outside.

Luke Letlow, a congressman-elect from Louisiana, died of covid-19 on Tuesday at a hospital in Shreveport, according to state officials. Letlow, 41, won a runoff earlier this month to represent the state’s 5th Congressional District, succeeding his former boss, Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.), who did not run again after three terms in Congress.

Letlow is the highest-ranking U.S. politician to die of covid-19, which has killed more than 337,000 Americans. He was scheduled to be sworn into office on Sunday.

Letlow announced that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Dec. 18, the Monroe News-Star reported, and isolated at his home in Richland Parish in northeastern Louisiana. By the next day, he was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport.

He is survived by two young children and his wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, the News-Star reported.

State and national political leaders mourned his death on Tuesday night.

“COVID-19 has taken Congressman-elect Letlow from us far too soon,” said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), in a statement shared on Twitter. “I am heartbroken that he will not be able to serve our people as a U.S. Representative, but I am even more devastated for his loving family.”

Letlow was a native of Start, La., a town of about 900 people, and graduated from Louisiana Tech University before launching his political career as a staffer for Bobby Jindal (R), who went on to become a U.S. congressman and then Louisiana’s governor, the News-Star reported. When Abraham was elected to Congress in 2015, Letlow joined him as chief of staff.

In the race to succeed Abraham, Letlow was the establishment Republican, earning endorsements from his former boss and heavily outraising his opponents, the Associated Press reported. He took the most votes in a nine-candidate field in November, then bested Republican state Rep. Lance Harris in a Dec. 5 runoff.

As the coronavirus ravaged Louisiana, Letlow urged residents to follow social distancing guidelines and to listen to doctors, noting that Abraham, a physician, had returned to Louisiana to help treat covid-19 patients.

But photos on his Twitter page show he had an inconsistent record of wearing masks while campaigning, sometimes covering his face at meet-and-greets but also speaking indoors without a mask on to rooms of mask-free residents. At a candidate forum in October, Letlow urged the state to ease pandemic restrictions, saying, “We’re now at a place if we do not open our economy, we’re in real danger.”

After his symptoms worsened earlier this month, Letlow was first taken to St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe, where he sounded a hopeful note on Dec. 21, tweeting that he was “confident” in his recovery. Two days later, he was taken to a Shreveport hospital and placed in an intensive care unit, where he was treated with remdesivir and steroids, according to a statement from his office.

This week, he was in critical condition but showing signs of recovery, G.E. Ghali, the chancellor of LSU Health Shreveport, told the Advocate. But on Tuesday, he suffered a “cardiac event” and died, Ghali said. Asked whether any underlying conditions might have contributed to his death, Ghali said, “None. All covid related,” the Advocate reported.

Letlow’s death comes as coronavirus cases and fatalities are rising in Louisiana. On Tuesday, the state recorded more than 3,900 new cases and 61 deaths, according to data compiled by The Washington Post, a 185 percent jump over the average number of deaths in the past seven days. In all, the state has had more than 304,000 cases and 7,397 deaths.

After Letlow’s death, Jindal recalled his former staffer’s “passion for service” in the years they worked together.

“I first met Luke when he was still a college student, and spent countless hours with him in his truck driving the back roads of Louisiana,” Jindal wrote on Twitter. “His passion for service has been a constant throughout his life.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also noted Letlow’s devotion to public service.

“Congressman-elect Letlow was a ninth generation Louisianan who fought passionately for his point of view and dedicated his life to public service,” Pelosi said in a statement. “As the House grieves Congressman-elect Letlow’s passing, our sorrow is compounded by the grief of so many other families who have also suffered lives cut short by this terrible virus.”

Louisiana’s congressional delegation, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R), released a joint statement praising Letlow’s “positive spirit.”

“We are devastated to hear of Luke Letlow’s passing. Luke had such a positive spirit, and a tremendously bright future ahead of him,” the statement said. “More than anything, Luke was a loving husband, father, brother, and son, and his family — like so many others who have been affected by this evil disease — needs our prayers.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he spoke to Letlow’s family after his death.

“Our hearts break tonight as we process the news of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow’s passing,” he wrote on Twitter. “I spoke with his wife, Julia. Judy and I are praying for her and their two young children during this terrible time.”

Travelers boarding a flight during the pandemic might consider it unlikely that anyone sick with the coronavirus would make it onboard. But the reality is that travelers are boarding planes with covid-19, putting their fellow passengers at risk of contracting the illness. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Beyond the danger those infected passengers are creating to the people around them, they also pose a sizable risk to themselves when they board their planes. Doctors say that flying is a high-risk activity for coronavirus-positive individuals because of low air pressure in the cabin and that multiple passengers have now died because of it.

When a man infected with the coronavirus died of acute respiratory failure on a United Airlines flight from Orlando to Los Angeles on Dec. 14, he was not the first individual to die of covid-19 on a plane. In July, a Texas woman died of the disease on a Spirit Airlines flight that was diverted when she was found to be unresponsive and not breathing. In both cases, the passengers were given CPR on the plane but could not be revived.

Advertisement

The likely medical problem in both these instances, doctors say, is that low air pressure — which is standard in plane cabins — creates dangerously low blood-oxygen levels in people with respiratory conditions. Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, is a respiratory disease that often attacks the lungs and heart.

Nicholas Hill, pulmonary chief at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, says there is “no question” that the air condition in plane cabins poses a risk to passengers with covid-19 and that flying was probably factor in the deaths of the passengers infected with the virus.

“If you get on a plane with covid, or anything else respiratory-related, you are going to be at a considerably higher risk when you go to altitude,” Hill says. “This is not something unique to covid; it’s true of anybody that’s got an acute or respiratory condition. This change in oxygen from sea level can provoke crises in the air.”

Plane cabins are pressurized so passengers are able to breathe at altitudes over 30,000 feet, but the air pressure is still about 25 percent lower in a plane cabin than it is at sea level. Flying has long given respiratory-troubled patients medical crises in the air. Covid-19 is no different. Flying with it can impact blood oxygen levels to a degree that requires immediate medical attention.

David Freedman, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, says covid-infected patients are at the same risk as people with non-coronavirus lung and heart conditions that impact their breathing. Airlines are prepared for those kinds of respiratory emergencies with supplemental oxygen onboard.

“The oxygen concentration [on planes] is much lower than on the ground, and all patients with severe lung or heart disease know this and know that they will need supplemental oxygen on board even if they don’t require it normally,” Freedman says. “All planes do carry an oxygen tank on board for emergencies like this.”

Delta Air Lines says that respiratory emergencies make up about 10 percent of in-flight medical events and that all aircraft are equipped with supplemental oxygen.

All airline flight attendants receive annual training in CPR, Taylor Garland, a spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants labor union, told The Washington Post in an email. Flight crew are also in close contact with medical services on the ground that can meet the aircraft in the event of an emergency landing.

But those efforts all fell short in the July and December deaths. Hill says passengers do not necessarily need to be experiencing shortness of breath before takeoff to become breathing-impaired in-flight. Blood oxygen levels can be low in covid-19 patients who are not experiencing trouble breathing, making getting on a plane with the virus — even if you’re pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic — a high-risk endeavor.

“Early on in the pandemic there were descriptions of ‘happy hypoxia’ patients, covid patients who come in with pretty low oxygen levels but wouldn’t be short of breath,” Hill says. “Most people who have low oxygen levels are also complaining of shortness of breath, but it is possible initially to not have those symptoms.”

On the July Spirit Airlines flight, a crew member who administered CPR to the unresponsive woman passed out from exhaustion, according to reporting by The Post. Contact tracers reportedly never notified passengers on the plane of the positive coronavirus case onboard.

Tony Aldapa, an off-duty medical worker on the Dec. 14 United flight who gave chest compressions to the unresponsive man, said last week that he was experiencing coronavirus symptoms after helping the flight crew with CPR. He was not notified about his exposure to the virus by contact tracers until 10 days after the flight.

“I knew we were pretty far from where we needed to land at, and CPR is exhausting with one person or two people. Even with three or four people, it’s not an easy thing to do,” Aldapa, 31, told the Los Angeles Times of the incident. “Regardless of COVID … he needed CPR to save his life.”

Earlier this month, Tom Mountain, a Massachusetts Republican Party leader, posed for a maskless photo in front of a silver menorah as dozens of other guests without face coverings mingled nearby at a White House Hanukkah party. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Three days later, the vice chairman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee was rushed to the hospital with a severe case of covid-19 that later left him close to needing a ventilator.

Now, as Mountain recovers at home in Newton, Mass., he says he likely contracted the virus at the White House event.

“Lets put it this way: When I went down to Washington, D.C., for the White House Hanukkah event, I was perfectly fine,” Mountain, 60, told WJAR. “And three days later after that event, I was in the hospital … ready to be put on a lifesaving ventilator.”

The Dec. 9 event where Mountain believes he contracted the coronavirus was one of at least 25 indoor holiday celebrations the White House scheduled despite warnings from the Trump administration’s public health experts to avoid large gatherings and travel to mitigate the spread of a virus that has killed more than 333,000 Americans.

Superspreader events are the leading cause of coronavirus transmission in the U.S. Here’s what they entail, and why they are so dangerous. (Video: The Washington Post)

The White House holiday parties came months after a Rose Garden introduction for then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett became a ‘superspreader’ event that left President Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and more than a dozen attendees and administration officials with the virus.

Asked to comment on Mountain’s claim that he likely contracted the virus at the Hanukkah celebration, a spokeswoman for the first lady referred The Washington Post to earlier statements touting safety measures at the holiday events, including reduced crowd sizes and mask requirements.

Mountain, who also serves as the vice chairman of the state’s Republican Jewish Committee, said his wife urged him to skip the White House Hanukkah celebration over fears that he would contract the virus, the Boston Globe reported. She chose to stay home, but Mountain told WJAR that he felt “politically and morally obligated to go.”

He attended the first of two Dec. 9 Hanukkah celebrations, which were split up to reduce the crowd size, Mountain told the Globe. Attendees were required to wear a mask while waiting in line, but Mountain said many guests removed them once inside.

Mountain, sporting a “Trump” jacket and a red, white and blue tie, also strolled through the East Wing without a mask.

“People would just leisurely and gingerly take off their mask to mingle, to schmooze,” he told WJAR. “I don’t even think some people wore masks the entire time. And again, I was guilty as anyone else. I just wasn’t wearing a mask.”

Mountain spent the three-hour party snapping pictures in front of the president’s official seal and alongside some of the 100-plus other attendees, including attorney Sidney Powell. Mountain said many were disappointed that the president didn’t make an appearance.

Trump did briefly speak at the second Hanukkah party held that day, where he repeated baseless claims of mass election fraud as a crowd chanted, “Four more years!”

Mountain was tested for the coronavirus when he returned home on Dec. 11, the Globe reported, as he began experiencing symptoms. His results came back positive, and the next day, as his condition worsened, he was admitted to Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

He was released a day later but returned to the hospital the following week when his symptoms became more severe again. Twice, Mountain said, he was close to being put on a ventilator.

Although his wife skipped the White House event, she and other relatives, including Mountain’s son, daughter in-law and mother in-law, all later tested positive for the coronavirus as well, according to the Globe.

Mountain said he regrets attending the event and not taking the virus seriously enough. Some of the symptoms are still with him, he added. He is still experiencing coughing attacks and sweating profusely. Last week, he could not speak over the phone, he told the Globe.

“I didn’t listen to the warnings of my own family, and now I’m paying the price,” Mountain told the Globe.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa — In an emotional address Monday night, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reintroduced bans on public gatherings and alcohol sales, made mask-wearing required in public and lengthened a curfew as a second wave of coronavirus cases sweeps Africa's worst-hit country at ""an alarming and unprecedented rate."" Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Earlier this month, South African scientists discovered a new variant of the coronavirus, similar to one found in Britain. Ramaphosa said it was “well established” throughout the country at this point. Testing positivity rates have soared above 30 percent nationwide, up from just 5 percent two weeks ago.

Cases of the South African variant have also been found in Britain, Finland and Switzerland, but Ramaphosa did not close the country’s borders as he had during its first wave.

Only a handful of countries have banned travel from South Africa. South Africa’s health ministry pushed back against assertions that its new variant is more dangerous than Britain’s, saying there was “no evidence” to support that claim.

On Sunday, South Africa passed 1 million coronavirus cases. More than 50,000 cases have been recorded since Christmas Eve — just under one case per 1,000 people nationwide.

“I beg you all” to follow the new measures, Ramaphosa said toward the end of his address, with tears in his eyes. He also asked South Africans to join him in lighting a candle at midnight on New Year’s Eve in remembrance of the more than 26,000 who have died of covid-19.



South Africa’s second wave will probably grow a great deal in the coming days. In some hot spots such as Cape Town, testing positivity rates have approached 50 percent. Researchers said the new variant is driving the surge.

“We have very strong reason to believe that this variant is much more transmissible,” said Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform, which coordinates analysis of genetic samples of the virus. “This variant has grown very fast, which means it has a high transmission, because it is dominating most of the infections. It is very unusual.”

Ramaphosa identified most of South Africa’s major cities as hot spots, including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and Polokwane. In the province of Eastern Cape, he said, the number of hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths had now surpassed the worst of the first wave, and most places in South Africa had yet to see the peak of the ongoing wave.

He also said 4,630 public health workers had contracted the coronavirus in December alone, partly due to the fact that the new variant is more transmissible, putting front-line workers at an even higher risk.

It’s unclear when vaccines will arrive in South Africa. The country is largely relying on the World Health Organization-led Covax facility, but Ramaphosa said Monday that his government was engaged in discussions with manufacturers, though he did not say with which or for what scale of vaccine purchase.

More so than in previous speeches, Ramaphosa seemed personally burdened by South Africa’s difficulty in flattening its curve of infections. The country makes up for more than 40 percent of all coronavirus deaths across the African continent — a figure health experts say is driven in part by South Africa’s higher proportion of people older than 65.

Early in the pandemic, South Africa imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, with bans on sales of cigarettes and alcohol, nearly all travel restricted, and restaurants and bars closed. Even walking the dog could result in a ticket.

By September, new case numbers had dropped to around 1,000 per day. Recent days have seen more than 10,000.

On Monday night, Ramaphosa chastised some South Africans’ “extreme lack of vigilance during the holiday period,” and noted that many wear masks to gain entry into restaurants and shops, only to take them off once inside.

“We have let our guard down, and now we are paying the price,” he said.

All three of the country’s main private hospital groups said their intensive care units were under strain.

Richard Friedland, chief executive of Netcare, said the recent surge in coronavirus cases had “placed a significant and unprecedented demand” on health-care facilities.

Friedland warned that hospitals are being overwhelmed and may not be able to provide necessary care to new patients due to a lack of sufficient beds and equipment, such as oxygen tanks and ventilators.

“Practically, this may mean that levels of care such as ICU and high care, ventilators and oxygen delivery modalities may not be available to all patients,” he said.

While the United States was preoccupied by its own problems — a presidential impeachment, racial injustice, an out-of-control pandemic and an election cycle like no other — 2020 was the year China showed the world it would rather be feared than loved. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Chinese President Xi Jinping had already abandoned the “hide your strength, bide your time” mantra espoused by former leader Deng Xiaoping. Now, with U.S. global leadership in retreat under President Trump, Xi seized on the distractions of the pandemic and the U.S. election to further tighten domestic societal controls and forcefully assert his will abroad — consequently escalating conflicts with the West.

Here’s a look at some key developments this year:

Taking control in Hong Kong

Hong Kong utterly transformed in 2020. In recent years, the city had become synonymous with its pro-democracy protests. During the summer, China moved to tighten control of Hong Kong, ending the city’s long-standing autonomy and imposing a feared security law that has made almost any dissent punishable by prison.

Advertisement

As 2021 nears, the city’s status as a backbone of global business appears to be in jeopardy while an exodus is underway of democracy activists, in addition to regular families. The fallout has not only hit at home: China’s crackdown on Hong Kong’s freedoms also led the United States to impose sanctions against Chinese officials and spurred Britain to open its doors to Hong Kongers seeking refuge.

Repressing Uighur Muslims

China’s campaign against Muslim Uighurs intensified in 2020. Bolstered by the state’s high-tech surveillance powers, China expanded its detention camps and forced labor in the western Xinjiang region, and increased repression of other ethnic groups, including in Inner Mongolia.

Amid growing alarm about the abuses, Western attention is focusing on forced labor in supply chains emanating from China. Beijing has in turn faced increasing resistance in Europe, whose leaders were long regarded by some China watchers as too passive about the Communist Party’s geopolitical intentions. At the same time, Muslim nations — top recipients of Chinese loans and coronavirus vaccine deals — have remained largely silent about the Uighurs’ treatment.

Retooling the economy

As both the first country hit by the coronavirus and one of the earliest to bring it under control, China’s economy began to recover sooner than other major countries. Nationalistic state media trumpeted the economic revival and the successful virus fight as evidence of the superiority of China’s authoritarian system vs. the democratic West.

But economic realities remain far less rosy. China’s vital export markets remain depressed, while growing bond defaults among state-owned enterprises point to signs of financial stress and looming trouble ahead. China is trying to address these risks by dialing back on state-backed industrial stimulus and refocusing the economy under a “dual circulation” strategy centered on domestic demand and self-sufficiency — but neither can be achieved quickly.

In 2021, China will also have to contend with the new Biden administration and its own pledge to retool China-U.S. economic relations.

Rising China-India tensions

A deadly clash in June between Chinese and Indian forces in the Himalayas escalated tensions between China and India. The deepening friction between the two regional powers led India to draw closer to the United States, as well as to its regional allies Japan and Australia through an emerging bloc known as the Quad. India additionally blocked dozens of Chinese-owned apps, including TikTok, inflicting hefty losses on China’s tech sector. The dicey India-China relationship remains poised for further problems in 2021.

Growing threats against Taiwan

In 2020 Xi and other Communist Party leaders stepped up threats against Taiwan with a sharp rise in military incursions into Taiwanese airspace and increasingly menacing language about seizing control of the democratic island. China also reinforced its territorial claims over the disputed South China Sea, which the United States has said it rejects outright.

Widening Washington-Beijing tensions

Growing tensions with Washington spilled into academia, science and media, with Beijing expelling American journalists and the U.S. restricting visas for Chinese students and Communist Party members. Trump, meanwhile, moved to ban WeChat and TikTok in the United States.

Suppressing domestic dissent

Domestically, Xi showed zero tolerance for dissent in 2020.

The year ends with a growing list of detainees. Ren Zhiqiang, a tycoon who wrote an essay criticizing the Chinese leader’s coronavirus response, was jailed for 18 years. Xu Zhangrun, a Tsinghua University professor, was detained for similar criticisms of pandemic secrecy. Cai Xia, a former professor at China’s elite Central Party School who now lives in the United States, was expelled from the Communist Party after it emerged in leaked audio that she described Xi as a “mafia boss” who had killed his country.

In a case that made headlines worldwide, Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor silenced by police after he tried to raise alarm about the novel coronavirus long before Chinese authorities acknowledged its full threat, died of covid-19 in February.

Seizing the narrative

In the backdrop of 2020, China’s “wolf warrior diplomacy” further contributed to increasingly unfavorable views of Beijing in many countries. Officials and state media have repeatedly mocked the United States as a chaotic morass of incompetence, violence and racial tension — a combative take bolstered by the Trump administration’s incoherent response to the pandemic and penchant for extreme rhetoric. Concurrently, China this year moved more aggressively to punish countries that have resisted its pressure, notably Australia, which it hit with import bans.

In the hours after country music legend Charley Pride died of covid-19 complications on Dec. 12, fans were devastated. And then they started asking questions. About a month earlier, the 86-year-old singer attended the Country Music Association Awards, where he received a lifetime achievement award. But many viewers were shocked to see the ceremony taking place indoors, in front of nearly 100 people, the majority of whom were not wearing masks on camera. Following the news of Pride’s death, a flood of social media posts — including some from high-profile country stars — wondered whether his attendance or travel from his home in Texas to the show in Nashville led to his illness.

It is unclear where and when Pride contracted the coronavirus. The CMA released a statement saying that it “followed strict testing protocols outlined by the city health department and union” and that Pride — whose family said he was hospitalized in late November — tested negative before coming to the show, again upon landing in Nashville, and multiple times when he got home. Pride’s manager Kevin Bailey echoed this to the Dallas Morning News and praised the CMA for “taking every precaution,” and added that anyone saying otherwise is “crusading to stir up some mud.”

Pride’s publicist did not respond to multiple requests for additional details, and when reached by phone, Bailey declined to discuss the topic. A CMA spokeswoman said: “Out of respect for his family, we do not have further comment.”

And yet it’s hard to imagine country music’s year in the pandemic ending on a worse note. The genre has made a slew of unflattering headlines over the past 10 months, from Chase Rice’s not-socially-distanced summer concert to Morgan Wallen being dropped as the “Saturday Night Live” musical guest after violating the show’s coronavirus protocols. Then there was the strange tone of the CMA Awards, the format’s biggest night in the national spotlight to celebrate music known for capturing real life and “three chords and the truth,” trying to project an image of cheerful normalcy in a tragedy-filled year.

It’s a lightning-rod topic that almost no one wants to talk about publicly — but behind the scenes in Nashville, according to industry veterans, it’s a subject nearly everyone has talked about. One common term used to describe these types of incidents is “tone deaf”; there’s anger, fear and a lot of questions. Among the questions that come up among people in the industry: Given that nearly every other awards show went largely virtual this year, why did the CMA Awards have to be in person, especially with virus cases spiking in Tennessee? Why do country stars keep showing up on social media attending maskless indoor gatherings or traveling? What message is it sending to their fans?

“I think the thing that angers me the most is they’re purporting to represent a working-class art form . . . but what I see is nothing but ‘me, me, me,’ ” said roots musician Rhiannon Giddens, who tweeted about her grief and frustration after Pride’s death. “It just hits me so hard. The excesses of the commercial country music industry are not my thing, and that’s fine — but this year, it’s just really hard to see all of that.”

While country stars are hardly the only celebrities to use their wealth and resources to host events and travel (the Kardashians and their private island, anyone?), they have received their share of criticism for pandemic activities. Cole Swindell recently posted an Instagram photo of a group of Nashville singers including Wallen, Kenny Chesney, Luke Combs and Jake Owen (and, for some reason, retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning) with their arms around each other at a bar. While it mostly earned delighted reactions, the comments were also peppered with ""Come on boys mask up"" and ""Not a mask among them"" and ""Is this an ad to catch covid for the holidays?"" The response sparked arguments among fans.

In October, Wallen made national headlines when SNL dropped him as a musical guest after TikTok videos surfaced that showed him partying maskless with students at the University of Alabama. (He was later rebooked.) Shortly after, Jason Aldean encountered some backlash over a no-masks family photo at Disney World. “Chill out lady. They are in our pocket. We took them off for 5 seconds to take the pic,” Aldean wrote to one critic, before deleting the picture.

A similar dynamic occurred in mid-December when Thomas Rhett and his wife, Lauren Akins, posted photos of a group trip to Mexico, and some fans were not thrilled: “Wish I could be happy for you but the rest of us are not traveling to try to keep covid at bay.” Afterward, Rhett said he was taking a break from Instagram because of the negativity.

This echoes other singers’ decisions on whether to engage on social media: According to one Nashville industry veteran, one star simply declines to upload photos because every time they post a maskless one, they are criticized no matter what.

The potential of being publicly shamed is a powerful influence. Country singers saw the outcry in June when Rice and Chris Janson held concerts the same weekend and shared Instagram pictures of people packed together with no masks. The intense reaction, some said, seemed to discourage other singers from attempting to hold concerts.

“It wasn’t about the fear about getting covid,” theorized Clay Myers, who owns Nashville Music Consultants. “They were scared of the public disapproval of them playing shows.”

The pandemic has decimated the live touring industry, and performers are understandably anxious about their futures and providing for their band and crew members. While musicians are all eager to get back on the road, in November, many country singers let their frustrations show on social media when pictures of people celebrating President-elect Joe Biden’s victory started to go viral.

“Knew we were waiting on the election since March when this s--- show started,” Florida Georgia Line’s Brian Kelley wrote on Instagram under a picture of crowds gathered in Washington, adding, “Time to go back to work AMERICA. Booking shows ASAP.” Other Nashville singers shared similar thoughts (“So this means we can play shows again right?” wrote Mitchell Tenpenny; Wallen added: “The hypocrisy is unreal”), though others criticized them for equating outdoor, largely masked gatherings in response to a contentious election with country music concerts.

“Perhaps most egregious, the nonchalant calls to restart live shows generally fail to consider or acknowledge the fans,” Joe Hudak and Jon Freeman wrote in Rolling Stone. “We’ve all been thrown into economic crisis because of the pandemic — millions have lost jobs, with music crews especially hard hit — and yet artists clamoring to return to the road in a traditional manner . . . suggests they’re not taking into account their fans’ finances or their very health and safety.”

On the other hand, lots of singers have dutifully followed protocols and are patiently waiting for the days when they can tour safely. Earlier this year, the Academy of Country Music Awards and CMT Music Awards went ahead with mostly virtual shows, as artists performed outside or in remote locations, and accepted trophies via video. Then in October, the CMA Awards announced that the show would ""mark the first time the biggest names in country music will come together — safely, all in one room — this year.""

Things got off to a rocky start when the show promoted itself on Twitter as a “no drama zone,” which briefly stirred controversy as some took it as a warning to artists to not discuss current events. Then, five acts (Lee Brice, Florida Georgia Line, Lady A, Rascal Flatts and Jenee Fleenor) had to drop out after testing positive for the virus or being exposed to someone who had tested positive. In interviews after the telecast, executive producer Robert Deaton and CMA chief executive Sarah Trahern ran through the long list of state, local and union protocols they followed to hold the show inside the Music City Center. Deaton told Variety the reasoning behind the in-person ceremony was to have it properly reflect the CMA brand.

“We knew we could not do a Zoom show; we could not do a living room show. We could not do that and have it represent the CMAs, which is ‘country music’s biggest night,’ ” Deaton said. Trahern emphasized that anyone who stepped on set had to first test negative. “Probably one of the safest places in the world to be was at our show,” Deaton said.

Still, news coverage of the awards was nearly overshadowed by headlines about all the positive tests before the telecast, as well as the lack of mention of covid-19 and the absence of masks — which some considered a missed opportunity to send a powerful message to country music’s fan base. (In the Variety interview, the producers later compared it to a restaurant, and said that anyone not seated or singing had to wear a mask; and added that they provided plastic shields for artists who didn’t want to wear face coverings because of hair and makeup.)

The optics took another dive with Pride’s death, as fans vividly remembered him, four weeks earlier, accepting his Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award with an emotional speech and performing onstage with Jimmie Allen. People instantly started speculating. “I don’t want to jump to conclusions because no family statement has been made. But if this was a result of the CMAs being indoors, we should all be outraged,” country artist Maren Morris, who was one of the many stars in attendance, said in a now-deleted tweet. Mickey Guyton and Brandi Carlile concurred, as did Giddens.

“It’s like the [Trump rally], they held this big gathering and then who’s the one that died? The Black guy. Herman Cain. I was just like, here it is again, there’s this big country gathering, and who’s the one that dies? The Black guy. It’s just so cosmically unfair,” Giddens said. “So it’s just kind of like, of course we’ll never know [how it happened] — but it doesn’t seem like it even needed to be a question.”

That’s the other issue that has come up repeatedly in conversations with Nashville insiders, even as many declined to speak publicly. (Nobody wants to tick off the CMAs, one said, as others noted the high-profile organization’s power and board members’ influence in town.) Charley Pride was a groundbreaking legend, one of the genre’s first Black stars. He had 30 songs reach No. 1 on the country charts. He could have received the award, which was instituted in 2012, well before 2020. Presenting him with the award in the year of racial reckoning appeared to be a way for the CMAs to recognize the serious lack of diversity in the genre. In doing so, Pride was faced with the choice of whether he should travel for the show — and as CMA defenders have pointed out, he did make the decision to go. But, behind the scenes, many feel he should have never been asked to make that choice.

“The thing that breaks my heart the most is that Charley Pride has been trained for decades about the way country music works — first and foremost, it’s loyalty to country music,” said a longtime Nashville industry insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “If you’re presented with an opportunity and turn it down, or request something be changed, you’re unlikely to get that opportunity again.”

“You smile and be a good soldier. And if you say no? Country music moves on,” the insider said. “The moment you say, ‘I don’t want to do it that way,’ they’ll find someone else who will do it that way.”

As coronavirus vaccines are distributed across the United States, some questions and misleading information have emerged. Here is information to combat five common concerns. Only the vulnerable need to get the vaccine. Many people, unfortunately including elected officials, have said publicly that they will not get vaccinated. For example, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) announced last week that he would refuse the vaccine, saying that he is healthy and that the vaccine is only for those at risk — which he defined as health-care workers and the elderly.

There’s a lot of misinformation to unpack here. As has been well reported, younger individuals and those across many occupations are among the more than 320,000 Americans who have succumbed to covid-19. Even setting aside those facts, Buck’s statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work. Vaccines protect more than the individual who is inoculated; the goal is to have enough of the population vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity,” which is also, accurately, called “community immunity.” The more people who are immune means fewer people the virus can infect — lowering the infection rate and the risk for us all.

Another reason that everyone eligible should get the vaccine is to protect those who cannot get it. With studies on children and the virus just getting started, it’s likely that young kids and babies won’t be able to receive the vaccine until fall 2021. Immunosuppressed people may need to rely on the immunity of others to help them stay healthy. In this sense, not getting a vaccine is like not wearing a mask: Your decision affects not just you but everyone around you, too.

There’s no point in getting the vaccine if we still have to wear masks. Vaccinated people should keep wearing masks and follow social distancing guidelines. In fact, we will all need to wear masks for some time. Although the vaccine is more than 94 percent effective at reducing symptomatic illness, it isn’t yet known whether it reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus and being an asymptomatic carrier — a person who can unknowingly infect others.

As vaccination brings us all closer to herd immunity, there will be a point when enough of the population is protected that we can do away with masks. That could happen by the end of 2021. In the meantime, vaccination is a crucial tool. It doesn’t replace other tools but is a powerful measure that can help save lives and help the economy recover.

We don’t know how long the vaccine will protect us. Virus mutations could mean the vaccine won’t work. A study of the Moderna vaccine found a robust antibody response for at least 119 days. We don’t yet have data beyond this, though some experts believe immunity should last at least a year. As for mutations, all viruses mutate. Vaccines are designed to consider possible mutations, though it’s possible that enough mutations could eventually reduce the potency of the existing vaccines.

It may turn out that people have to receive regular booster shots, as we already do for tetanus or an annual shot that adjusts for variants, as we do for influenza. The theoretical necessity of future vaccinations doesn’t override the urgency of getting one now.

The vaccine is not safe. People have cited different safety concerns. For those worried about the messenger RNA technology, this is how it works: The mRNA is a portion of the genetic code that teaches cells how to make a protein that then triggers an immune response. Importantly, the mRNA of the vaccine never enters the nucleus of people’s cells and does not interact with an individual’s DNA. None of the coronavirus vaccines being tested in the United States contain a live virus, so no one will get covid-19 from the vaccine. Although it’s often heralded as a new method, this technology has been in development for decades.

For those worried about political interference in expediting approval, it’s critical to emphasize that no shortcuts were taken in research or the approval process. Vaccine safety was tested in phase 3 trials involving tens of thousands of participants. External committees of scientists vetted the data and produced independent recommendations to support vaccine authorization.

Allergic reactions suggest that the vaccine is dangerous for at least some people. Allergic reactions can easily be treated without lasting consequences. The same cannot be said about covid-19. Allergic reactions also happen right away — within minutes. It isn’t yet known what component of the vaccine triggers allergic reactions, but there is no reason for people with food or medication allergies to avoid the vaccine as long as they are monitored in a health-care setting.

Over the next several months, we may all hear family, friends and colleagues express vaccine hesitancy. Let’s approach them with empathy, understand the cause of their concern and aim to address those issues with accurate information. Ending the pandemic will require all of us talking to those we know to debunk myths and help everyone understand that vaccines are safe, effective and life-saving.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Susan Gerber, the respiratory viruses supervisory branch chief at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was one of the CDC scientists removed or shifted to another position in the spring. Gerber had no supervisory role over the test development from mid-January and later accepted another position at CDC through a competitive process. This story has been corrected.

A new virus was exploding in Wuhan, a Chinese city with 11 million people connected by its airport to destinations around the world. In the United States, doctors and hospitals were waiting for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a test to detect the threat.

On Jan. 13, the World Health Organization had made public a recipe for how to configure such a test, and several countries wasted no time getting started: Within hours, scientists in Thailand used the instructions to deploy a new test.

The CDC would not roll out one that worked for 46 more days.

Inside the 15-acre campus of the CDC in northeast Atlanta, the senior scientists developing the coronavirus test were fighting and losing the battle against time.

The agency squandered weeks as it pursued a test design far more complicated than the WHO version and as its scientists wrestled with failures that regulators would later trace to a contaminated lab.

The Washington Post reviewed internal documents and interviewed more than 30 government scientists and others with knowledge of the events to understand more fully the missteps in those early weeks as the coronavirus began to spread unchecked across the nation. Most spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to do so publicly.

This account reveals new details about how an overly ambitious test design and laboratory contamination caused the CDC’s delay, and describes previously unreported challenges that confronted the agency scientists assigned to carry out the work.

CDC leaders underestimated the threat posed by the new virus — and overestimated the agency’s ability to design and rapidly manufacture a test. Quality-control measures failed to prevent the shipping of compromised kits to dozens of state and local public health labs.

The CDC’s response to what became the nation’s deadliest pandemic in a century marked a low point in its 74-year history. More than 329,000 Americans have died of the virus. In an agency long known for its competence, hubris became the nemesis that could not be overcome.

The CDC has quietly removed or shifted to other duties scientists who were involved in developing the coronavirus test, according to those familiar with the matter. Those displaced included a longtime division director and a respiratory virus specialist who led the design of the test.

The problems with the CDC’s test kits are the subject of ongoing inquiries by the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general and the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

“We missed the game,” a senior CDC disease-transmission specialist said in an interview. “Many people here wish we had done things differently.”

Nearly all of those in charge at the highest levels of the CDC lacked hands-on lab expertise and for weeks deferred to subordinates — scientists who were logging grueling, high-pressure hours on the highly technical work.

Stephen A. Morse, a retired agency microbiologist who had helped establish a formal affiliation with the public health labs to ensure rapid responses to outbreaks caused by nature or biological terrorism, said the CDC’s approach was simply too narrow.

It would have been prudent, he said, “to use the WHO test that was already available. At the same time, get a better understanding of the performance of that test — see if you could improve on it with a second-generation test, as opposed to trying to develop your own test, independent of what’s out there.”

Without tests to identify the early cases, health authorities nationwide were unable to isolate the infected and trace the rapid spread among their close contacts. Those who were asymptomatic, yet contagious, went undetected.

CDC Director Robert Redfield, an appointee of President Trump, took a hands-off approach while the in-house manufacturing efforts foundered and agency scientists clashed over whether to alter the design of the problem-plagued test, according to CDC and other federal officials.

James Le Duc, who as the director of the Galveston National Laboratory in Texas oversees development of diagnostics for rare pathogens, said he is perplexed by the CDC’s decision-making.

“The test that the WHO used early on was quite successful,” said Le Duc, a former senior CDC official who still serves as an adviser to the agency. “I frankly don’t know why CDC didn’t accept it.”

Redfield and other CDC leaders declined to be interviewed or to respond to written questions about the agency’s handling of the test.

“Appreciate the opportunity, but we are going to pass,” said CDC spokesman Benjamin N. Haynes.

The struggles with the test kits had far-reaching consequences.

“If we would have put [tests] out there quicker, could we have saved lives? Well sure,’’ said Peter C. Iwen, director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory in Omaha. “If we would have diagnosed quicker, we would have saved people.”

A working test within hours

Since its founding in 1946, the CDC has grown from a regional bulwark against malaria in the southern United States to a world leader in fighting diseases of all kinds.

Nowhere has the CDC’s presence abroad been larger than in Thailand, where the agency maintains offices and a staff of about 170 epidemiologists, laboratory specialists and others. In 1980, the CDC established its first overseas epidemiology program in a suburb of Bangkok, training a new cadre of disease detectives.

In early January, Thai doctors in Bangkok were worried by the outbreak in Wuhan, less than seven hours away by airliner. They strategized at length about the threat with their local CDC counterparts. They also learned from scientists enough about the genetic makeup of the new coronavirus to begin developing a molecular test for in-hospital use.

That initial test would use real-time polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, to examine sputum samples in search of unique genetic material from the virus.

On Jan. 12, using their new test, the Thais became the first country to confirm a coronavirus case outside China, a sickened traveler from Wuhan.

The same day, the Chinese posted on the Internet what public health authorities worldwide had been waiting for: the complete genetic sequence of this previously unseen strain of the coronavirus, the cause of the disease soon to be named covid-19.

Another breakthrough came the next day, Jan. 13, when the WHO publicly shared a protocol, essentially a recipe, specifying the materials needed to build a molecular test.

The Thais used that protocol to make a second test to detect the virus. This redundancy would eventually become the model for developing a vaccine against the virus.

“Multiple shots on goal,” as Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. infectious-disease expert, often said of the approach. That way, said Fauci, if one attempt stalled or failed, another might score.

The approach paid off immediately for the Thais.

“We have not relied only on one testing technique from one laboratory,” Krit Pongpirul, a researcher and clinical epidemiologist at Bangkok’s Bumrungrad International Hospital, said in an email exchange with The Post.

Using their version of the WHO test, Thai health officials within days found other cases, including a taxi driver. He had not been to Wuhan, but Pongpirul and a colleague suspected he had become infected by Chinese travelers. Thai officials traced and tested close contacts of the cabbie and others who were found to be infected. The contacts were persuaded to isolate themselves to prevent the virus from spreading.

One of the infected, the Thais found, was asymptomatic — an early warning that the coronavirus was being spread by those not overtly sick.

“Patient 4 had detectable [virus] for 4 consecutive days, but we were only able to follow her for 7 days before she returned to China,” the Thai doctors and others wrote in a subsequent scientific journal article. “Her case is an example of a person without reported symptoms but with radiologic evidence of disease and detectable virus over several days.”

By the end of January, the Thais had diagnosed 11 patients with covid-19, according to Pongpirul, who described the details in the email correspondence and in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, published by the CDC.

Four of Pongpirul’s 11 co-authors were CDC specialists — three of them based in Bangkok and the other in Atlanta.

“The early availability of the RT-PCR testing definitely helped to reduce transmission and save lives,” Pongpirul told The Post by email.

The Thai scientists shared their success and insights in a Jan. 13 conference call that included CDC personnel in Bangkok and at headquarters in Atlanta.

“This was the first indication of international spread,” said an Atlanta-based official who described the call as riveting. “ ‘Why Thailand?’ We found out there was a direct flight from Wuhan.’’

CDC NARRATIVE | John R. MacArthur discusses the novel coronavirus's spread to Thailand (Video: GPA Interactive)

John R. MacArthur, a physician who had led the CDC’s Thailand operations since 2013, said that when PCR testing confirmed the first case there, “I immediately contacted CDC leadership in Atlanta to let them know what was happening.”

“Seeing the first case outside of China, I thought, was a big moment,’’ MacArthur said in a phone interview.

MacArthur, one of the co-authors of the journal article, said the CDC’s lab training in Thailand gave officials there “the tools that they needed to respond very quickly and effectively.’’

At CDC headquarters, officials did not adopt the strategy that proved successful in Thailand.

Instead, the agency planned to design and manufacture its own test in-house and ship 300 of those kits to 120 public health labs throughout the United States.

At the time, CDC officials in Atlanta expected that the strain emanating from Wuhan, while worrisome, would be no worse than two earlier coronaviruses that spurred dread before fizzling out, those familiar with the matter said.

One of those viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, originated in China in late 2002 and killed 774 people worldwide, but none in the United States. Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, emerged in 2012 and over the next seven years killed 866 people, but resulted in only two U.S. infections and no deaths.

Neither SARS nor MERS was known to be widely spread by people who had no symptoms.

“It was being treated as a MERS situation or a SARS situation,” said a CDC scientist who had helped confront the new threat in January and who declined to speak on the record because he was not authorized to do so. “At that point we thought it was going to be a limited activity.”

'Can you make this happen?'

In the first week of January, Nancy Messonnier, a physician and director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Atlanta campus, spoke to Stephen Lindstrom, an accomplished respiratory virus specialist. She wanted to know if, and how soon, he could get a coronavirus test up and running.

“Can you make this happen?” she asked, according to a person familiar with the exchange.

Lindstrom, co-inventor of seven earlier CDC tests for strains of the flu, had transitioned in 2018 to lead a respiratory virus lab that focused on diseases other than influenza.

Before saying yes to Messonnier, Lindstrom had an ask that she would promptly grant: He needed to pull in at least 20 people to supplement his staff of eight lab specialists.

On Jan. 9, Lindstrom outlined his plans to Messonnier, as well as the director of the viral diseases division, Mark A. Pallansch, and the respiratory viruses branch chief, Susan Gerber, among others. In a conference room near Messonnier’s eighth-floor office, Lindstrom narrated a slide show that spelled out how the test manufacturing and other tasks would be divided up.

That same week, Lindstrom recruited Julie M. Villanueva, who was also a PhD scientist and with whom he had collaborated on anti-flu efforts over the previous decade. In 2016, she had led the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center during an outbreak of the Zika virus.

Over the next few days, Lindstrom, who had not previously designed a coronavirus test, set about researching what materials were necessary as well as a recipe for combining them to detect the virus with PCR.

All of the CDC scientists and officials involved with the test’s development and named in this report — including Messonnier, Lindstrom, Pallansch, Gerber and Villanueva — declined to comment or referred questions to the agency’s public affairs office.

Invented in 1983, PCR is a multi-step test to detect infectious agents, including viruses in humans, using a sample of sputum or other genetic material. A machine extracts nucleic acids from the sample, placing them into a small tube with various chemical reagents, including an enzyme that converts viral RNA, which is present in coronaviruses, into DNA.

Some of the solution is then transferred to tiny plastic wells containing additional reagents to help detect whether the virus is present. The wells are placed into a PCR machine, resembling a midsize office photocopier.

The process seeks to copy and amplify targeted regions of the coronavirus genome. If the virus is present in the original sample, a detectable, fluorescent dye is released.

Two components that Lindstrom designed for the CDC’s test, called N1 and N2, focused on separate regions of the virus’s genome, a conventional approach.

But Lindstrom, aided by a lab colleague with coronavirus experience, Xiaoyan Lu, chose to add a third component that distinguished the CDC’s test design from others: This component would identify a wider family of coronaviruses, including SARS and bat-carried strains not known to have infected humans. They called it N3, and Lindstrom told colleagues it would help detect the novel coronavirus if it began to mutate, according to interviews with those familiar with the matter.

Villanueva’s chief role was to ensure that each step of development and production was properly documented and communicated to the public health labs and to regulators at the Food and Drug Administration. CDC officials expected the FDA to expedite emergency authorization of the test, and scientists said Lindstrom and Villanueva worked so seamlessly that colleagues took to calling them what sounded like one name, “Steve-and-Julie.”

On Jan. 17, just days after the Chinese made public the virus’s genetic sequence, Messonnier announced at a news briefing that health authorities in Thailand and Japan had already used molecular testing to detect coronavirus cases. Testing was beginning as well in South Korea and Taiwan.

“We at the CDC also have the ability to do that today, but we are working on a more specific diagnostic,” Messonnier said, indicating that the agency was seeking a more sophisticated test.

To provide reliable detection, a PCR test must be sensitive enough to identify microscopic levels of a pathogen — and able to distinguish them from genetic neighbors.

During the same briefing, Messonnier gave a low-key forecast of what to expect from the new coronavirus.

“It’s highly plausible that there will be at least a case in the United States,” she said.

Nationwide, the stakes were magnified because the 120 public health labs were without a government-approved test of their own and, with few exceptions, depended wholly on getting the CDC’s kits. Based on Messonnier’s forecast, companies had no incentive to navigate regulatory hurdles and mass-produce kits.

Representatives from the public health labs listened to Messonnier’s remarks on Jan. 17 and heard no grounds for concern.

Scott J. Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, recalled thinking: “We’ll get 100 labs up and running really quickly. We’ll be on top of this.”

Confidence remained high over the next few days. Messonnier said in another briefing that, as of Jan. 19, the CDC had “finalized development” of its test. The CDC used it in Atlanta, she said, to quickly confirm the first known U.S. coronavirus case, a man in Washington state who had just returned from Wuhan.

“Right now, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in coming weeks, we anticipate sharing these tests with domestic and international partners,” Messonnier said, adding, “We continue to believe the risk of this novel coronavirus to the American public at large remains low.”

On Jan. 30, the New England Journal of Medicine published an account from German doctors describing a worrisome twist with the virus.

They documented the case of a 33-year-old “otherwise healthy” businessman who took ill on Jan. 24 with a sore throat, chills and body aches from what turned out to be covid-19. Three days before, he had met extensively in Munich with a Chinese counterpart. At the time they interacted, she had shown no signs of sickness. But the woman became ill on her return flight to China, where she tested positive for the virus on Jan. 26.

It was “notable,” the doctors wrote, that the woman’s “infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period,” before she showed symptoms.

A scientific orchestra

Lindstrom had seen no significant trouble with his nascent test when he confirmed the diagnosis of the first U.S. patient on Jan. 19, those involved said. As February approached, he was collaborating with Villanueva and their team to work through the remaining technical details.

They had to ensure proper manufacturing of the test so it could be distributed to the labs nationwide, and also secure the FDA’s swift authorization.

Lindstrom, who grew up in the Canadian prairie province of Saskatchewan, was known to colleagues as diligent, accessible and, at times, bluntly spoken. A self-described lab geek, he had worked at the CDC since July 2000.

Now he was conducting a burgeoning scientific orchestra.

Lindstrom turned to the Biotechnology Core Facility Branch on the CDC’s Atlanta campus to make detection-enabling “probes” and “primers.” These were synthetic nucleic acids to be added to the mixture of other reagents. As the core lab commenced production on Building 23’s top floor, it sent Lindstrom a portion of each batch for quality-control vetting.

He still saw nothing of undue concern, according to those involved. With help from a third lab, the Reagent and Diagnostic Services branch, also in Building 23, the materials were poured into vials and readied for shipment to the states. On Feb. 4, the FDA granted the emergency authorization.

The state labs started vetting the kits, using samples that contained no virus. Then calls and emails began coming in to Atlanta describing a consistent problem: false-positive results — confined to Lindstrom’s signature N3 component.

Lindstrom tried to grasp the underlying cause. Were the labs doing something wrong? Could his design or protocol for conducting the tests be revised to eliminate the false positives and ensure reliable detection? Did something go wrong with the CDC’s manufacturing?

The troubleshooting dragged on for weeks, but the false positives persisted. The CDC halted further shipment of the kits.

Soon the state labs and the Association of Public Health Laboratories were pressing the CDC: What about streamlining the test to get it up and working? Lindstrom and Villanueva opposed doing so.

“We had a conversation with Steve and Julie and asked, specifically: ‘Lots of members are asking if we can drop N3 and just keep N1 and N2,’ ” recalled Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases for the professional association, based in Silver Spring, Md.

“And their response at that point was: ‘FDA isn’t going to go for that.’ Both of them were like, it’s a non-starter.’’

Government officials later told The Post that the FDA would have considered proposals to remove N3.

Some CDC scientists also were questioning among themselves the need for N3.

“Why are we trying so hard? . . . We know there’s a problem with it,” one of them recalled asking.

Instead of dropping N3, the CDC set about trying to manufacture a new batch of reagents in hopes of eradicating possible contamination that had caused the false positives. On Feb. 11, Villanueva informed directors of the state and local labs about the development.

“Thank you for your patience as CDC investigates reported sporadic aberrant reactivity in the N3 assay,” Villanueva wrote in an email. “After consultation and agreement with FDA, CDC is currently manufacturing and quality control testing a new N3 primer/probe set. . . . We hope to provide this replacement component as soon as possible.”

Lindstrom contacted industry sources, seeking private vendors that could promptly make more reagents, officials said. Scientists said he complained to colleagues about what he saw as a lack of urgency within the CDC to expedite the paperwork necessary for the contracts.

The public health labs remained in limbo as the virus continued to spread.

On Feb. 15, the labs’ newly formed task force on coronavirus testing circulated a bulletin, noting that “an overwhelming number of labs” had reported problems with the N3 component, adding in boldface, “The Task Force does not recommend that any PHL proceed with testing until CDC issues the new primer/probe set for the N3.”

The same bulletin advised that several of the labs had also reported “similar, although less frequent issues” with the N1 component.

A Feb. 17 email from a CDC supervisor, Darin Carroll, to six agency scientists, including Lindstrom, described concern about lab-induced contamination.

Referring to Jan Pohl, the core lab’s director, the email said, “Jan’s thoughts are that if the production facility is found to be free from contamination today it may be possible to have a small production run ready for drying/assembly by late this week.”

That same week, officials from a unit of the CDC responsible for monitoring lab safety and quality, led by associate agency director Stephan Monroe, traveled to the FDA’s offices in Silver Spring to confer about the false positives. Lindstrom also spoke with Monroe’s staff and opened his team’s lab records for review.

Meanwhile, the CDC tasked Lindstrom’s team with overseeing prompt PCR analyses of a growing number of samples arriving from the state labs, which remained unable to conduct tests themselves because the kits were unreliable.

Travelers returning from virus-besieged cruise ships were escalating demands for rapid test results in Atlanta. Lindstrom and Villanueva were also ordered by agency administrators to document their work in a separate information-management system, a time-consuming chore.

In mid-February, Lindstrom sought to clarify priorities at a meeting he attended that was led by the CDC’s coronavirus incident manager, influenza specialist Daniel B. Jernigan, and others in charge. “Tell me what the f--- you want me to do,” Lindstrom said, a person who heard the remark recalled.

Though pressure mounted from the public health labs and from within the CDC, Lindstrom and Villanueva defended the test’s design.

Lindstrom warned superiors that dropping N3 might lead to missed cases of infection, false negatives. Villanueva told colleagues that the design was of “Nobel quality,” according to those familiar with the matter.

Lindstrom also conferred with Pohl, the chief of the core lab. A chemist, Pohl initiated rigorous measures to eliminate any contamination that might be causing the false positives, which were not confined to N3, records show.

Nine public health labs, including facilities serving the city and state of New York, the District of Columbia and Minnesota, reported difficulty with N1, lab officials said. The FDA would later conclude that N1 was probably contaminated during work in Lindstrom’s lab in Building 18, a view shared by CDC leaders.

In an email on Feb. 19, a scientist at the core lab, Nicky Sulaiman, told Lindstrom that Pohl had agreed to also decontaminate “all . . . areas and instruments” to be used in further manufacturing of the reagents.

On Feb. 23, a diagnostic-test expert from the FDA, Timothy Stenzel, entered the CDC to examine how the test kits were developed. He concluded that lab conditions for making the kits were substandard and that contamination was the most likely cause of the many N3 false positives, federal officials told The Post. It was likely, Stenzel later told HHS lawyers, that the contamination occurred during quality-control checks made in Lindstrom’s lab.

Stenzel saw nothing wrong with Lindstrom’s design, including N3 — but he flatly advised the CDC to shift any additional manufacturing of the kits to outside contractors.

Lindstrom believed that the contamination with both N1 and N3 stemmed from the core lab, those familiar with the matter said. He continued to say that the kits should include N3.

Meanwhile, the delays had become a national crisis.

By the third week of February, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was leading the government’s quest for a coronavirus vaccine, ducked into the office of Brian Harrison, chief of staff to HHS Secretary Alex Azar, about the stalemate with testing.

“Brian — you’ve got to do something,” Fauci said. According to officials familiar with the conversation, Harrison replied, “I share your concern.”

Azar urged Redfield and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn to intervene and take steps to end the impasse, a department official said. On Feb. 26, the FDA told the CDC by email that public health labs could use the test, without N3.

Two days later — 46 days after the World Health Organization publicly shared its protocol for coronavirus testing — Messonnier announced that the labs “can start testing.”

Epilogue

Throughout the CDC’s struggle to deliver a reliable test, Director Redfield repeatedly assured officials that a solution was close at hand, according to interviews with those involved.

When members of the White House coronavirus task force pressed him, Redfield, a physician and longtime HIV researcher, signaled complete faith in the CDC’s scientists. One task force member recalled that Redfield “kept on saying, ‘We got this covered, don’t worry.’ He made it seem that the fix was quick, a minor thing.”

Another official, who was privy to Azar’s regular phone calls with Redfield, said the low-key CDC director consistently defended the agency’s approach with the test kits.

“This was kind of the theme for about a month,’’ said the official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to comment.

Messonnier has told colleagues that, not being a virologist or laboratory specialist, she relied on subordinates with greater subject-matter expertise.

Starting in spring and over the next few months, CDC leaders removed or shifted scientists who worked on or supervised the original test, officials said.

Lindstrom was shifted to an advisory role and no longer leads the respiratory virus lab.

Pallansch, who oversaw Lindstrom, was removed by Messonnier from his job as director of the viral diseases division and now holds a title of special adviser, officials said.

A polio virus expert and 36-year CDC employee, Pallansch told colleagues that if he had known about the N3 component when the test was designed, he would have challenged its inclusion as unnecessary. A person familiar with Pallansch’s thinking also said he regretted not having initially sought out the information.

In a June 19 report on the testing problems, the HHS lawyers said that “time pressure to ship test kits out quickly” may have caused the CDC to shortchange proper quality control and to miss “anomalies in data” and “likely” contamination before the kits were released.

What happened at the CDC remains under scrutiny by the HHS inspector general and by the GAO, according to their representatives. The department lawyers also have recently questioned Messonnier and staffers involved with making the kits, officials said.

Global mortality from the disease has varied dramatically: Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, all of which jump-started coronavirus testing in January, have experienced death rates of less than 2 per 100,000 people. In the United States, the rate is 91 deaths per 100,000 people, according to lab-confirmed cases archived by Johns Hopkins University. Experts hesitate to quantify how many lives were saved by the early testing in Asia.

But Michael V. Callahan, a Massachusetts General Hospital infectious-disease physician who was detailed in February by HHS to help repatriate Americans from cruise ships hit by the coronavirus, said the CDC and the White House should have seen the gravity of the threat.

“We had a fast-moving outbreak with a solution at hand,” said Callahan, referring to the tests used immediately in Thailand and elsewhere. “Yes, CDC should make its own super-special test. But until then, they should make the test that will help us curb the problem.”

In recent weeks, senior CDC officials, including Jernigan and Monroe, have been drafting a review of the testing struggles that attributes the test failures with N3 to Lindstrom’s design, and with N1, to contamination in his lab. Officials said the summary is envisioned for public release, possibly in a scientific journal.

The GAO’s chief scientist, Timothy M. Persons, said that lessons to be learned from the CDC’s mishandling of coronavirus testing should shape policy for future outbreaks.

“The whole thing is a race,” Persons said. “You have to get the testing right as soon as possible, because if you don’t, you don’t know the size of the problem.”

United and Delta will require passengers traveling from the United Kingdom to the United States to present proof of a negative coronavirus test, the airlines announced on Thursday. Delta will begin enforcing the rule today, and United will begin the requirement on Dec. 28. The airlines will accept both rapid antigen and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.

The changes come after British officials imposed lockdowns and banned holiday gatherings earlier this week because of a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus. Canada and some nations in Europe have moved to ban travel from England altogether.

“Beginning December 28, United customers traveling from London Heathrow to Chicago, Newark, Washington Dulles and San Francisco will be required to present proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no later than 72 hours prior to departure,” United said in a statement. “The health and safety of our employees and customers is our highest priority.” United is requiring the tests for all passengers over the age of five.

Delta also requires the test result be less than 72 hours old. Passengers flying from the United Kingdom to the United States, or transiting through the country, will be required to show the test before boarding, a spokesperson for Delta said in an email. The airline will require the negative tests from all travelers over the age of six.

On its website, Delta states that passengers who are not traveling from the United Kingdom, and are only transiting through the U.K. on a layover, will be exempt. On Monday, Delta moved to require health screenings on U.K. flights to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy lauded the strengthened health protocols for U.K. visitors, saying in a statement: “As we continue to experience a second wave of COVID-19 cases, it’s critical that we take any and all precautions to mitigate the potential for further transmission.”

Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

When Merlin Pambuan awoke in September after four months hooked up to a breathing machine that helped keep her alive, the intensive care unit nurse sickened with the coronavirus was comforted knowing her life was in the hands of her colleagues, treated at the same hospital she had worked at for 40 years.

But she still could not feel her extremities following a deep sedation that started in May, shortly after she had contracted the virus while treating patients with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif. As first reported by Reuters, the nurse could not remember anything about a period in which she had come close to dying “multiple times,” according to her doctor.

This week, doctors and nurses who have been pushed to their limits in a part of Southern California ravaged by the pandemic received a rare piece of good news: Pambuan had recovered from covid and was leaving after being hospitalized for eight months fighting the virus.

The 66-year-old was met by dozens of cheering, masked co-workers as she walked down the hallway at St. Mary on Monday, an emotional scene on a day her family and physician were uncertain would come.

“I’m thankful,” Pambuan said to Reuters. “This is my second life.” She added: “Don’t lose hope. Just fight.”

The nurse’s recovery, which has been celebrated on social media this week, offered a much-needed feel-good moment at a time when more people in the United States are being hospitalized with the coronavirus than at any other point during the pandemic. Nearly 120,000 covid-19 patients nationwide were receiving inpatient treatment as of Wednesday, the second consecutive record-setting day, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.

The situation is particularly dire in Long Beach, where daily cases have exploded by more than 1,000 percent in recent weeks. Following two record days of covid-19 deaths in Long Beach, the city on Wednesday activated a “mass fatality” plan to support morgues that are close to capacity.

At St. Mary, the hospital is so full that some patients are being treated in the ambulances that brought them there, the Long Beach Post reported. Other patients are in beds lining the hallways, and nurses have seen almost three times as many people as usual, according to the newspaper, amid a period that was described by one hospital official as “extremely busy.”

“The covid crisis in Long Beach is not getting better; it’s getting worse,” Mayor Robert Garcia (D), who lost his mother and stepfather to the virus, said in a news conference Wednesday. “We have to just recognize that we are living through the biggest challenge we have ever faced as a community and a city.”

The crisis was felt early on by Pambuan, a hospital veteran who was treating some of the most critically ill patients at St. Mary when she tested positive in the spring. A paralysis-inducing sedation resulted in the ICU nurse needing both a breathing tube and a feeding tube, according to Reuters. Pambuan was in such bad shape that Maged Tanios, a pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist at St. Mary, floated end-of-life options to her family.

“At multiple times, she was very near death,” Tanios said. “I would say this happened at least a half-dozen times.”

Though she regained consciousness in early September, a grueling physical and respiratory rehabilitation program awaited Pambuan to help her move arms and legs that had been immobile for months. While the task was daunting, the 66-year-old said she refused to back down from taking control of her life again.

“I said, ‘No, I’m going to fight this covid,’ ” she said, reported Reuters. “I start moving my hand [and] a physical therapist come and say, ‘Oh, you’re moving your hands,’ and I said, ‘Oh, I’m going to fight, I’m going to fight. I’m trying to wiggle my toes. I’m going to fight it.’ ”

Her extended hospital stay for most of the year is another example of the thousands of patients recognized as “long-haulers,” who continue to suffer the consequences of covid months after they were infected. While doctors are still uncertain as to why this is the case, public health experts have noted it’s increasingly clear that many people are bound to face long-term effects of the coronavirus.

When the time came to leave the hospital this week, the ICU nurse would not use a wheelchair or walker to exit. She would walk slowly, but walk nonetheless, determined to thank her colleagues on her own terms.

As her colleagues applauded Pambuan and recorded the moment on their phones, the nurse located and embraced Tanios, the physician who knew how close she came to not making it.

“This is what we live for,” the doctor said. “This is what makes us go through this pandemic and these difficulties … for the results of seeing our patient going home alive and in good condition.”

Have you played that new Covid Gotcha game? It’s fun for the whole family! Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Here’s how it works: One player announces he’s going to do something involving some risk of covid-19 exposure. Then, another player pounces with an example of a far less risky thing the first player adamantly argued against just hours before.

You’re letting Elphaba spend the weekend, even though we agreed Glinda couldn’t come over to watch basketball unless she quarantines first?

You’re going for a maskless jog with Olaf? But you just said I shouldn’t meet Kristoff for dinner, even if it’s outdoors in a strong wind!

And so on. The player who identifies the greatest inconsistency wins!

Just kidding: There are no winners. The game ends when someone leaves to check the Internet for clear and incontrovertible covid behavior guidelines and never returns.

That’s where we are as 2020 comes to a close. We argue endlessly about relative risk — indoors sitting far apart vs. outdoors huddled around a fire; six feet vs. 15 — but, since we’re human, the real, unspoken debate is about relative reward. Is it really too risky to drink eggnog on the in-laws’ porch on Christmas Eve, or is it just that you don’t want to spend a cold evening with your husband’s mother — no matter how safely? Is there any good excuse for your daughter not to quarantine after she comes home from abroad, or is it just that the idea of stowing her in the basement for a week makes you want to cry?

Keeping each other honest and fact-based could be considered a positive family activity, I guess, if we could keep our voices down. But why are we even arguing about our personal covid protocols? Why don’t we just follow the rules?

Because we, like most Americans, have been left to regulate ourselves.

The federal government is giving us mixed messages, to put it mildly. Even their official health guidelines have loopholes (see “Options to Reduce Quarantine”) and defer to local authorities for the “final decisions.” Meanwhile, those local authorities struggle on without federal aid. New York’s Albany County, where I live, is probably doing the best it can, but it’s still relying too much on residents to play Covid Gotcha on their own. “I’m begging you,” said the county executive, just before Thanksgiving. “By doing the right thing, we can get out of this.”

Follow Kate Cohen 's opinions Follow

We did not. At the same time, the state government is adding to the confusion. According to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s original plan, all of New York should be shut down again at our current rate of spread, but when the numbers were headed fast toward another widespread “pause,” he simply changed the plan.

To Cuomo’s credit, he’s honest about the balance between reward and risk — “the last thing that anybody wants is a shut down” — but he’s still leaving it to us to police ourselves. “New Yorkers are smart, I think they’re going to learn from Thanksgiving, and I think you’ll see a smarter response through the holidays.”

Hang on a minute while I go check the Internet for evidence of people getting smarter.

There’s hope in the vaccines and in the change of president. But the next administration should refrain from pinning too much hope on us. President-elect Joe Biden has said that the moment he takes office, he will ask people to wear a mask for 100 days. Sure, ask. But also, please, mandate masks in public indoor spaces and enforce that mandate. Close the places where we gather indoors against our (or our families’) better judgment. Compensate the businesses that have to close. Pay workers to stay home if they have covid symptoms. Make testing easy, fast and free. Restrict gatherings and travel and enforce those restrictions.

In other words, make us behave as though we are still in the midst of a massive public health crisis in which thousands of Americans are dying every day.

In Britain, where the situation is dire but not U.S.-level dire, Prime Minister Boris Johnson just declared southeast England — London and its environs — on lockdown. No gyms, bars, restaurants; no shops, theaters, hairdressers. No holiday gatherings.

The head of the Labour Party immediately responded that millions of families across the country “are going to be heartbroken by this news, having their Christmas plans ripped up.” Maybe. But I bet some of them will be relieved that the people in charge have taken charge. I bet some will be relieved to stop arguing about what they should and should not do. I know I would be.

I’m tired of playing the game. All I want for Christmas is the rules.

As coronavirus vaccines are distributed across the United States, some questions and misleading information have emerged. Here is information to combat five common concerns. Only the vulnerable need to get the vaccine. Many people, unfortunately including elected officials, have said publicly that they will not get vaccinated. For example, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) announced last week that he would refuse the vaccine, saying that he is healthy and that the vaccine is only for those at risk — which he defined as health-care workers and the elderly.

There’s a lot of misinformation to unpack here. As has been well reported, younger individuals and those across many occupations are among the more than 320,000 Americans who have succumbed to covid-19. Even setting aside those facts, Buck’s statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work. Vaccines protect more than the individual who is inoculated; the goal is to have enough of the population vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity,” which is also, accurately, called “community immunity.” The more people who are immune means fewer people the virus can infect — lowering the infection rate and the risk for us all.

Another reason that everyone eligible should get the vaccine is to protect those who cannot get it. With studies on children and the virus just getting started, it’s likely that young kids and babies won’t be able to receive the vaccine until fall 2021. Immunosuppressed people may need to rely on the immunity of others to help them stay healthy. In this sense, not getting a vaccine is like not wearing a mask: Your decision affects not just you but everyone around you, too.

There’s no point in getting the vaccine if we still have to wear masks. Vaccinated people should keep wearing masks and follow social distancing guidelines. In fact, we will all need to wear masks for some time. Although the vaccine is more than 94 percent effective at reducing symptomatic illness, it isn’t yet known whether it reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus and being an asymptomatic carrier — a person who can unknowingly infect others.

As vaccination brings us all closer to herd immunity, there will be a point when enough of the population is protected that we can do away with masks. That could happen by the end of 2021. In the meantime, vaccination is a crucial tool. It doesn’t replace other tools but is a powerful measure that can help save lives and help the economy recover.

We don’t know how long the vaccine will protect us. Virus mutations could mean the vaccine won’t work. A study of the Moderna vaccine found a robust antibody response for at least 119 days. We don’t yet have data beyond this, though some experts believe immunity should last at least a year. As for mutations, all viruses mutate. Vaccines are designed to consider possible mutations, though it’s possible that enough mutations could eventually reduce the potency of the existing vaccines.

It may turn out that people have to receive regular booster shots, as we already do for tetanus or an annual shot that adjusts for variants, as we do for influenza. The theoretical necessity of future vaccinations doesn’t override the urgency of getting one now.

The vaccine is not safe. People have cited different safety concerns. For those worried about the messenger RNA technology, this is how it works: The mRNA is a portion of the genetic code that teaches cells how to make a protein that then triggers an immune response. Importantly, the mRNA of the vaccine never enters the nucleus of people’s cells and does not interact with an individual’s DNA. None of the coronavirus vaccines being tested in the United States contain a live virus, so no one will get covid-19 from the vaccine. Although it’s often heralded as a new method, this technology has been in development for decades.

For those worried about political interference in expediting approval, it’s critical to emphasize that no shortcuts were taken in research or the approval process. Vaccine safety was tested in phase 3 trials involving tens of thousands of participants. External committees of scientists vetted the data and produced independent recommendations to support vaccine authorization.

Allergic reactions suggest that the vaccine is dangerous for at least some people. Allergic reactions can easily be treated without lasting consequences. The same cannot be said about covid-19. Allergic reactions also happen right away — within minutes. It isn’t yet known what component of the vaccine triggers allergic reactions, but there is no reason for people with food or medication allergies to avoid the vaccine as long as they are monitored in a health-care setting.

Over the next several months, we may all hear family, friends and colleagues express vaccine hesitancy. Let’s approach them with empathy, understand the cause of their concern and aim to address those issues with accurate information. Ending the pandemic will require all of us talking to those we know to debunk myths and help everyone understand that vaccines are safe, effective and life-saving.

Earlier this month, just as Florida neared its 20,000th covid-19 death, a bit of good cheer popped into the inboxes of 160 state lawmakers: an invitation (plus one!) to Gov. Ron DeSantis’s holiday bash at his Tallahassee mansion. No masks or social distancing required; any devotion to science or reality could be checked at the door. The event narrowly avoided superspreader status: The state senate’s president regretted his absence only hours before the soiree when a coronavirus test came back positive.

Welcome to Florida — America’s sun-drenched State of Suspended Disbelief. From the pandemic’s infancy, DeSantis has conveniently, even diabolically, airbrushed covid-19 out of public life here. The result: 1.2 million total covid-19 cases, nearly 61,000 total hospitalizations and a new seven-day case-positivity rate of 9.7 percent — all rapidly rising toward crisis levels. Even Texas, which isn’t exactly a model of coronavirus caution, has a statewide mask mandate and lower cumulative infection rate than Florida.

The Republican governor’s response to the pandemic, in other words, has been a disaster — yet he shows no signs of changing course. Today, amid the state’s third surge, Floridians and tourists stand shoulder-to-shoulder in bars and restaurants and sashay into nightclubs and strip clubs. At the same time, DeSantis continues to shrug off statewide mask and distancing orders along with any real effort at contact tracing.

The governor has consistently played down the risks of covid-19, ignored credentialed scientists, sided with herd-immunity advocates, withheld information about hospitalizations and cases in nursing homes and schools, and cherry-picked numbers. In a state with a strong open-records law, DeSantis smothers transparency. As part of a “Blue Skies” initiative, reported by the South Florida Sun Sentinel, our governor even made clear that the state health department’s media people should not mention covid-19 until after the election; instead, department communications encouraged Floridians to get their flu shots and sign up for hearing-loss screenings.

Now DeSantis is refusing to release the weekly White House Coronavirus Task Force Reports on Florida, and news organizations are suing. Replete with dire warnings, the reports apparently contradict his cavalier way of doing business here.

As if all this weren’t enough, DeSantis has also barred local governments from implementing shutdowns or fining mask scofflaws, making it even harder to persuade Floridians to take anti-covid-19 precautions. Some cities are in open rebellion, setting the stage for a state-local showdown. Who said Republicans aren’t hot for centralizing power?

The governor can at least take credit for one successful contact trace: His public-health strategy is openly tied to President Trump. DeSantis even paid tribute, in a way, by placing 1 million orders of hydroxychloroquine. It was the least he could do, considering that aping Trump got him elected in 2018.

DeSantis, for his part, pats himself on the back for his half-blind strategy. “We have, I think, really saved the livelihoods of millions and millions of students, parents, workers, business owners by approaching this in an evidence-based way that focused on facts, not fear, and in a way that was more moderate,” the governor recently told political donors and corporate bigwigs.

Admittedly, the state’s open-for-business policy has preserved jobs. Yes, wrecking Florida’s vulnerable tourism-and-hospitality economy would only ruin more lives, although many visitors are steering clear because of our hands-off covid-19 response and high numbers. I also agree schools should be open with the right precautions. But the governor has needlessly damaged the lives of so many Floridians with his unnecessary all-or-nothing approach: Mask mandates and social distancing are not pointless, and manipulating information to hide the seriousness of the pandemic is reprehensible.

DeSantis knew all too well that Florida would largely embrace his reckless approach. Floridians aren’t exactly known for their prudence and judgment. There’s a reason we gave the world Florida Man — who “responsibly” fires guns, “does not routinely defraud Medicare,” “resists the impulse” to haul an alligator into a convenience store or showcase his own “Most Wanted” poster on his Facebook page. It’s not a coincidence that, pushed by DeSantis, wearing a mask here devolves into a quién es más macho standoff. It’s a mask, for God’s sake, not a sedation-free vasectomy.

To be sure, not all Floridians are buying what DeSantis is selling. They are, however, buying the perfect protest prop: “My Governor Is An Idiot” face masks. According to a woman who sells them on Etsy, many Floridians are scooping up her inventory. Meanwhile, on Twitter, the governor has been dubbed “Duh-Santis,” an impressive distinction for a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School. I guess it’s better than his other handle, “DeathSantis.”

It’s hard to imagine what, at this point, DeSantis could do to redeem himself. But considering that vaccines won’t be fully available until late spring, and simple precautions could save thousands of lives in the meantime, it would sure be helpful if a tea party-backed, Trump-loving governor promoted them. Maybe the next time the governor goes to a high school football game packed with maskless fans, as he did recently, he can give us all a lifesaving holiday gift: Suck it up, set a good example and strap on a mask.

They felt anxious, depressed, lonely and lost in their devices. Amrit Baveja, 17, listened as other high school students talked last spring in a Zoom room about fallout from the pandemic and remote learning. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The students seemed so desperate to return to school IRL (in real life) that Amrit trusted they would resist their teenage tendencies and follow social-distancing rules and restrictions if they could just attend in-person classes.

Based on that faith, Amrit, a big data and machine learning enthusiast, teamed up with a programming partner, Beck Lorsch, 17, who has released six iOS apps. They spent the summer building an app intended to help their private high schools in Marin County, Calif., contain the spread of covid-19.

“They’re sick of online learning,” Amrit said. An app, the young men thought, could help overcome the obstacles to returning to the classroom for high-schoolers, who are considered more at-risk for serious illness from the virus and more likely to behave in ways that could transmit it than younger children.

Development turned out to be the relatively easy part for the two, who taught themselves to program using online platforms when they were in elementary school. In November, they won the 2020 Congressional App Challenge for California’s 2nd District. Navigating the fault lines of the teenage pull to party with friends was more treacherous.

Every morning before school, Amrit and Beck’s app, called MarinTrace, asks students and teachers about their health, travel and if anyone in their life has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which causes the covid-19 disease. If they answer yes to any question, the program instructs them to stay home, emails school administrators, and contact tracing and testing is supposed to begin.

Administrators at Branson, Amrit’s school, began piloting the app in October, soon after the campus, nestled in wooded hills north of the Golden Gate Bridge, opened for the first time since the coronavirus closed it in March.

About 50 of the high school’s 320 students and 15 faculty members volunteered for the test study. Participants’ class schedules were downloaded into the app, and they agreed to self-report all their contacts — from between-class conversations to shared meals, parties and sleepovers.

Amrit and Beck worked on the assumptions that students would honestly disclose their interactions because they want their school to remain open and that they wouldn’t want to sacrifice the battery life of their phone or their privacy to an app that would track their every move.

Like Google maps, surveillance apps that use GPS can drain cellphone batteries. Moreover, the prospect of corporations or government agencies monitoring a student’s every step raises privacy concerns.

In New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, parents fired off angry emails after the schools superintendent was quoted in a Wired story expressing interest in a Volan Technology student surveillance app. The software would have monitored students to see if they were adhering to social-distancing guidelines and would have allowed administrators to quickly identify those exposed to covid-19.

Patrick Gallaway, the school district’s communications director, was reluctant to speak about the app proposal, except to say: “Our community was not thrilled about the concept. We’re not doing it.”

Volan Technology recently installed sensors in every classroom and hallway at Wickliffe High School, a suburb of Cleveland. In January, when the public school is scheduled to resume in-person instruction, some of the staff and 500 students will be asked to volunteer in a pilot project. Those who enlist will wear badges, which will wirelessly communicate with the sensors to track their movement.

If a student or teacher tests positive for covid-19, the badge will provide “a digital footprint” of where they’ve been and who they might have infected, said Joseph Spiccia, superintendent of Wickliffe City School District. He prefers electronic badges to phone tracking apps because students can remove badges when they leave school.

“That option kind of mitigates the argument that Big Brother is watching you,” he said.

But the badges remain Orwellian in the eyes of privacy expert Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP).

“We don’t think any of these systems has been shown to be effective, actually reducing transmission of covid-19,” he said. “And they all create a risk of bias that this technology will be used to target students of color and further expand tracking and criminalization of students.”

The danger, he said, comes “in the form of data that can be harvested by law enforcement, data that can be stolen by hackers.”

Amrit and Beck, a senior at Marin Academy, believed their classmates would have little appetite for tracking so they relied on self-reporting interactions that would lead to future contact tracing. And the student body had signed a code of conduct to steer clear of large gatherings or parties.

But just a couple of weeks into the app’s pilot, some Branson students breached the faith. They threw caution and their masks to the wind at Halloween parties. The school closed down again. The app played no role in detecting any outbreaks because the partygoers were not participating in the pilot.

“We cannot with confidence tell our employees, students or families that our campus provides an environment that is safe,” Chris Mazzola, head of the school, wrote in a letter to students and families.

Mary Jane Burke is considering using the app in Marin County’s schools where she is superintendent. With 80 percent of the county’s schools back to some in-person class time, between Sept. 8 and Dec. 3, public health officials had traced only a single case of covid-19 to in-school transmission, and it involved two staff members working in an office, she said.

“Anything we can do to streamline the collection of data and the health status of individuals is going to make it easier to have all students return to school,” she said.

Pierce Freeman, a 2014 Branson graduate and Silicon Valley computer scientist, applauded Amrit and Beck’s effort to help their own community.

“The more approaches that engineers come up with to try to solve this problem the better,” he said.

“Having people who are closer to the heartbeat of the community working on the problem is critical,” he said. “At the end of the day, the tension is between privacy and the need for contact tracing, and each community has to make the decision about the trade-offs for themselves.”

Haywood County, a majority-Black community not far from Memphis, has one health department, one nursing home and no hospitals. The fatality rate of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is 50 percent higher than the state average. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But a supply of vaccines based strictly on its population would leave the county in the Tennessee Delta, site of the first known slaying of an NAACP member for civil rights activities, woefully short. There would be too few doses to make a dent in the disease’s burden on residents of color, who have been “devastated, both young and old,” said Gloria Jean Sweet-Love, who lives in Brownsville, the county seat, and serves as president of the NAACP’s state conference.

“Can you believe it?” she asked. “In the richest country in the world.”

To account for the disparity, state officials are doing something unusual. They are taking a portion of their share of shots off the top and rushing it to places beset by poverty, poor housing and other factors most linked to the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on people of color. Explaining the move recently, Michelle D. Fiscus, who leads Tennessee’s immunization program, said, “Covid-19 has revealed that great disparity in outcomes for Black Americans.”

The approach illustrates the urgent effort by public health agencies to make sure inoculation against a virus that has ravaged communities of color — killing 1 in 1,000 Black Americans by the fall — saves the lives of the most at-risk people. The task is made more difficult by the need to reverse the inequities endangering people of color without enshrining an explicit system of racial preferences in the distribution of shots, which could prompt political blowback and legal challenges. It is harder still because of the limited initial supply of the vaccine, which is pitting essential workers, who are disproportionately people of color, against older Americans.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group has signaled it will recommend prioritization of certain essential workers, in part to address racial disparities exposed by the pandemic. People of color are overrepresented in industries such as food processing and transit, in jobs impossible to do from home. Some of these workers could gain access to the shots early in the new year, after health-care workers and residents and staffers at long-term care facilities.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to vote Sunday on recommendations for the next priority groups, heightening the pressure on state officials to refine their plans. The focus on essential workers as a way to advance equity has gained support from all 14 members of the independent panel of experts. Beth Bell, a clinical professor of global health at the University of Washington who chairs the panel’s vaccine working group, bluntly expressed the calculus: “If we’re serious about valuing equity, we need to have that baked in early in the vaccination process.”

Or, as Sweet-Love put it, “These are the folks at the bottom of the totem pole.”

The limited supply of shots, as most Americans head into winter unprotected from the deadly virus, has turned allocation decisions into ethical quandaries. The pandemic, by highlighting how racial fault lines warp the body politic, “also offers a moment to address and dismantle those inequalities so that everyone has a fair and just opportunity for health,” said J. Nadine Gracia, deputy assistant secretary for minority health under President Barack Obama.

Accounting for these inequities in state vaccination plans, Gracia said, is a “moral and economic imperative.”

‘As equitable as possible’

All the places where the pandemic has disproportionately harmed people of color — not just Tennessee — are confronting dilemmas about how explicitly immunization should be aimed at rectifying racial inequality.

In California, experts are devising ways to ensure communities of color “disproportionately are benefited” from vaccine distribution, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) vowed, “because of the impact they have felt disproportionately” during the pandemic. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) went as far as to threaten to sue the Trump administration over its national distribution plan, which he said failed “Black and Brown communities that were first on the list of who died.”

But it was in Tennessee, far from the made-for-TV promises of blue-state governors, that health officials put a number on their ambitions. They committed to setting aside 5 percent of their vaccine supply for areas with high scores on a CDC social vulnerability index — areas such as Haywood County, where the primary crop is still cotton and the closest emergency room is a half-hour away by car.

The index, originally developed to identify communities most in need of assistance after natural disasters, was recommended by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine for use in vaccine allocation because it incorporates factors “most linked to the disproportionate impact of covid-19 on people of color.” Those include minority status, crowded housing and lack of access to a vehicle — all factors that burden Haywood County, best known as the childhood home of singer Tina Turner.

The county, whose lone hospital closed in 2014, is already at a disadvantage because it cannot handle the two-dose vaccine regimen from Pfizer-BioNTech, which comes in 975-dose batches and must be stored at subarctic temperatures. Distributing shots made by Moderna based just on population would bring enough initial shots to Haywood County for not quite half of the county’s health-care workers, Fiscus said. That outcome would not be “as equitable as possible,” she said during a panel discussion this month on vaccine allocation and social justice.

The revised approach setting aside a portion of the state’s allocation to supplement the neediest areas was widely embraced in the deep-red state.

State Rep. Cameron Sexton (R), speaker of the Tennessee House, said he favored use of a clear index over “government picking winners and losers based on arbitrary facts.” Focusing on vulnerable populations, he said, “doesn’t make distribution a race issue. There’s no putting one over another. It’s based on health conditions.”

Advertisement

Others, meanwhile, said they were drawn to the approach precisely because it made race central to the allocation of the vaccine.

“Covid is not race-blind, and we need to act accordingly,” said Michael Caldwell, Nashville’s public health director. In meetings, he said, state health leaders have made it “crystal clear” that using social vulnerability as a guide to vaccine allocation is designed to focus attention on “inequities and disparities.”

The clashing views capture the way a National Academies committee wrestled with the issue. A race-based system of priorities would have prompted a backlash and created the appearance that “populations that already have mistrust of our health system were being told to go to the front of the line,” said Helene D. Gayle, president and chief executive of the Chicago Community Trust and a committee co-chair.

Advertisement

The approach is politically savvy, said Harald Schmidt, a bioethics expert at the University of Pennsylvania. By “baking metrics that grapple with race into the hardware of vaccine distribution decisions,” states can avoid the perception that they are favoring one group over another, Schmidt said.

Tennessee was the first state to commit in writing to using the CDC index to rush a set-aside share of the state’s supply to the most vulnerable areas, according to an analysis of state plans by specialists in medicine, bioethics and statistics. In draft plans, other states discuss the national index or metrics similar to it, said Schmidt, the paper’s lead author.

California intends to use its own equity metric. Georgia’s draft includes an equity statement that suggests there will be geographical prioritization based, in part, on “race and ethnicity,” but it offers no details, and the state health department did not respond to a question about how the equity aspiration would be realized.

Federal blueprints offer only vague language. The CDC playbook sent to states listed “critical populations” at increased risk from the coronavirus, including “racial and ethnic minority groups.” Just four states — Delaware, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska — retained this language in their plans, according to Ariadne Labs, a Boston center for health system innovation run jointly by Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“It could be somewhat random, but looking at those particular states, it could also reflect attention paid to tribal populations,” said Kate Miller, a senior scientist at Ariadne Labs.

Ariadne Labs found that plans in 19 states referred to a disadvantage index, among them the CDC’s vulnerability index. In some cases the aim is to guide distribution of the vaccine; in others it is to monitor its uptake in underserved areas. Tennessee makes explicit how the index determines the most basic question of all — the allocation of doses.

'A political hot potato’

When Sandra Lindsay, a Black critical-care nurse in New York, became the face of the first coronavirus vaccinations this week in the United States, she took note of the dual nature of her role. She wanted to inspire other nurses, she said in an interview, and to send a message to “minorities, people that look like me,” who may be “hesitant to take vaccines” because of mistreatment by the medical establishment.

Her words illuminated the lessons embedded in allocation plans that, on their face, say little about race. Across the country, some said justice was being done by sticking to deliberate phases putting workers, and especially health-care workers, first.

Stephen L. Williams, Houston’s health director, smiled recently as he drove past the light-rail station within the Texas Medical Center and saw that many of the waiting passengers were people of color, like him. Soon, he knew, many of the people on the platform would be vaccinated against covid-19 — not because of their skin color but because they are health-care workers.

“Look at how hospitals are staffed,” said Williams, who sits on the state panel making recommendations about vaccine allocation. “The people in their uniforms, getting on the train or bus after their shift — there are a lot of people of color in that group.”

Whether the people operating the buses go next is a more difficult question — and one even more freighted with issues of race and equity.

“The deeper you get, the more complexity there is,” said Nancy J. Cox, a virologist and former CDC official. “A lot of essential workers don’t have the same voice, they don’t have the same political pull, and those kinds of things may be coming into play here.”

Transportation is among the front-line occupations in which workers of color are most overrepresented, accounting for 56.7 percent of bus drivers and other transit workers, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a D.C. think tank. More broadly, about 4 in 10 front-line workers are Black, Hispanic, Asian American or Pacific Islander, the group estimated.

Many, like Bruce Caines, also have underlying health conditions. The 61-year-old, who has diabetes, works at a Trader Joe’s on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. During his shift, from 3 to 11 p.m., he unloads deliveries, stocks shelves, rings up customers. The elderly are not the only ones at risk, said Caines, who suffered a mild case of covid-19 in February and does not want to get sick again. “In my store, we already lost one crew member, a young guy in his early 20s,” he said.

Targeting front-line workers such as Caines, who is Black, “will be taking an equity approach,” said Richard Besser, who is chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation’s largest philanthropy focused exclusively on health, and a former top CDC official. “It would be a tragedy if communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic are not viewed as a priority for receiving the vaccine.”

The CDC advisory group estimates there are about 87 million essential workers, and states may choose to prioritize some over others. Many states, meanwhile, are building more-granular priorities into each phase, seeking to dodge the choice between front-line workers and elderly people.

Tennessee’s draft plan makes adults with chronic conditions a priority before “critical infrastructure workers” and gives preference to people 65 and older within each phase. California’s draft puts essential workers and people 65 and over in the same phase, betting on expanded supply early in the new year, though Newsom has recently spoken about the need to give particular consideration to teachers, farmworkers and grocery workers.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) of Florida, a close ally of President Trump, said at a recent White House summit he would like to see the vaccine reach the “broader senior population” by the end of December, an ambitious target that would probably involve passing over many front-line workers. Participating in a panel with three other Southern governors, he was the only one not to outline how vaccine allocation would address the needs of underserved communities when that question was posed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Instead, he decried “shutdowns that are totally unscientific.”

“I could see how this could become a political hot potato,” said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy organization.

The pressure is heightened by constraints on the vaccine supply, driven by international demand. Some of the thorniest political differences, however, are local.

David Smith, who runs the ambulance authority in Haywood County, said nine of the unit’s workers have fallen ill with covid-19, among a staff of about 27. Still, only three of the workers who respond to calls for emergency medical service intend to be vaccinated, he said. He is not among them, he added, citing concerns about how quickly the vaccines are being developed.

Brownsville’s mayor, Bill Rawls, said he hopes many will change their minds by the time the shots arrive in the county, which could be around Christmastime. So far, only the regional hospital, a half-hour away, has received doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

“It will be a gift sorely needed,” Rawls said.

With Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine being administered across the United States and Moderna’s vaccine under consideration for emergency authorization, there is a palpable sense that science has delivered. Yes, there have been remarkable breakthroughs, but the work is not done. Vaccine rollouts signal the eventual end of the coronavirus crisis, but many clinical trials are just getting started.

These remaining trials are so important that I’ve decided to participate in one.

When vaccine trials began, I wasn’t eligible to volunteer. None of the initial trials enrolled pregnant women or those who were breastfeeding, and I was still nursing after giving birth in April.

As the months went by, I heard many volunteers talk about how they wanted to do everything they could to fight the pandemic. For me, it was particularly compelling to hear about people who are racial and ethnic minorities taking part to try to ensure there was adequate representation for vaccines to help their communities. Their participation also demonstrated trust in institutions that once caused their groups great harm.

By the time I stopped breastfeeding, Pfizer and Moderna had released their exceptional preliminary data. I had no qualms about taking these vaccines. Still, I was eager to enter a trial because there is an urgent need to develop more vaccines. For the U.S. population to reach “herd immunity,” at least 70 percent of the population must be vaccinated. Vaccine production is the limiting factor, so we will get there much faster with multiple vaccines.

Anthony S. Fauci agrees. In a phone interview, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told me the goal was never to stop at two vaccines, even if they were found to be safe and extraordinarily efficacious. “We need at least several more vaccines if we are to get enough doses to vaccinate the overwhelming majority of the country,"" he said, ""which is hopefully what we will accomplish and get a good umbrella of immunity.”

“We also need vaccines for the rest of the world,” he added. Wealthier countries have purchased a substantial proportion of the initial expected vaccine supply, and a much greater supply of other vaccines is necessary to truly control the spread of covid-19.

Fauci raised the question of whether it’s ethical to keep conducting trials if two vaccines already appear to work well. “If these vaccines are available tomorrow to everybody that wanted it, then we might have trouble with new placebo-controlled trials. But it’s going to take a while to get the rollout of the vaccines that we have,” he said. Because all the vaccines are new, it isn’t clear which vaccine might impart longer-lasting immunity, which is also important to research.

Additional rigorous studies could help identify whether a specific vaccine is best for a certain population. Older people, for example, or those with an underlying medical condition may benefit more from one vaccine over another. There have been a few cases of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine; more studies may reveal whether people who are allergic to a component of one vaccine could take another.

I looked online to find clinical trials near me. The one with the most convenient location was a Johnson & Johnson trial. This vaccine is being tested as a single dose, a considerable advantage over most other coronavirus vaccines, which require two doses. It’s stored at standard refrigerator temperatures, which also makes it an attractive candidate for widespread distribution in lower-income countries.

To be clear, I could have just as easily volunteered for another vaccine trial. I have no inside information or other insights to suggest that the Johnson & Johnson candidate might be safer or more effective than another. And to avoid any potential conflict of interest with my writing and reporting, I am donating the study compensation to Health Care for the Homeless and the Maryland Food Bank.

I entered an arm of the trial that’s studying whether a second dose of the vaccine increases protection beyond just the one. So far, I’ve received the first of two injections. It’s a randomized and blinded study, so neither I nor the person who administered the shot know whether I got the vaccine or the placebo. I have a history of severe allergic reactions to penicillin and to peanuts, but I didn’t have a reaction to the injection or any other side effects. I’m completing a symptom questionnaire twice a week and am scheduled to receive the second dose two months after the first.

This is how science works. Science has gotten us to the point where we can see an end to this pandemic. How quickly we get there will determine how many lives can be saved. That depends on the speed of research. I am glad to take part in the scientific process, and I encourage others to join me.

“Songbird,” a thriller about a near future in which rampant, mutating coronaviruses prompt permanent lockdowns and quarantine camps, isn’t exactly relaxing viewing amid still-spiking covid-19 cases. But it is worth watching as a historical artifact — and for lessons it offers on how, and how not, to make art about the covid-19 pandemic.

“Songbird” started streaming last Friday, the same day the Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine. Although the vaccine rollout will take time, and the end of the pandemic is still far off, the nightmare scenario ginned up by director Adam Mason and co-writer Simon Boyes now seems more like a dystopia than a grim possible outcome.

The plot of “Songbird,” which was announced in May and began shooting in July, reflects what Americans worried about this past spring and summer. The story follows Nico (K.J. Apa), a former paralegal and bike courier who is one of a few people immune to the film’s scourge, “covid-23.” Everyone susceptible is quarantined, including Nico’s girlfriend, Sara (Sofia Carson); anyone who falls ill is immediately interned by the sinister and vast Department of Sanitation, whose agents look more like riot cops than garbage collectors.

By the standards of conventional moviemaking, “Songbird” moved from idea to reality with unusual speed: The process of writing and selling a movie, putting together the team who will make it, shooting and editing footage, and marketing the finished product can take years. Even so, given how real-world events have evolved since “Songbird” began shooting, the concepts that initially made the project appear timely and edgy are already dated.

In addition to the recent vaccine advances, other real-life developments are effectively checks on the film’s scenario. Resistance against directives to contain the spread of the coronavirus has included armed protests outside statehouses, physical attacks on retail clerks who asked patrons to put on masks and even reported plots to kidnap Michigan’s governor. These dispiriting — and dangerous — overreactions to efforts to protect public health are proof that Americans are far too independent to allow a jumped-up garbageman to implement a mass-internment scheme, as a character does in “Songbird.”

“Songbird” resonates better in its smaller moments, which provide its substantive value — as a record of how the covid-19 pandemic made people feel.

Nico and Sara’s sweet, chaste flirtation over video calls is reminiscent of the migration to online dating in recent months: When they finally meet, even the slightest gestures of physical intimacy take on a charge. Piper, a wealthy mother played by Demi Moore, has to tell her lonely, immunocompromised daughter that she can’t have friends over. “What are you going to do? Call Sanitation on two 12-year-olds?” the girl sasses. But in another scene, the child’s bravado disappears, and she asks if her mother wishes for a different, stronger daughter. Piper’s response will resonate with parents who have struggled to keep their children safe this year: “Why would I want to go anywhere if you couldn’t go with me?”

Although “Songbird” tries to frighten viewers with a lurid vision of a landscape where the only connection to the outside world is dropboxes that sanitize deliveries with UV rays, the film’s scariest scene is much more intimate. Piper’s corrupt, cheating husband, William, sneaks out to meet his mistress, a young singer named May. Initially, both are wearing masks. Then, William strips off May’s plastic face shield and cloth mask and kisses her as the camera lingers on her terrified face.

The scene crystallizes the idea that willingly exposing another person to a deadly virus — be it real or fictional — is an assault, and a particularly ugly one. William’s actions toward May aren’t about sex or closeness but a raw assertion that his desires matter more than her safety. People who aggressively flout masks and social-distancing guidelines may not recognize themselves in his character, but those who comply with these safety measures may recognize in May’s reaction their own feelings of powerlessness and rage at other’s activities.

Art inspired by the covid-19 pandemic can provide a public service by broadening understanding. Steven Soderberg’s 2011 movie “Contagion” is a tremendous film, but it didn’t actually prepare its millions of viewers to live through the spread of a viral disease.

Like everyone else, moviegoers are going to need help to process all that has happened this terrible year to them and their communities, their feelings of betrayal, the losses they couldn’t grieve with loved ones, the lives they couldn’t collectively celebrate, even the joys that were tainted or diminished in a time of widespread catastrophe. An entertainment industry long addicted to spectacle, and humbled by the pandemic, should take note: “Songbird” is at its best when its storytelling is most focused on human emotions, and most disposable when it’s a blockbuster. Cultural works can help, if only to reassure audiences that they aren’t alone and that their feelings aren’t abnormal.

In Boston, pediatric wards are being consolidated to fit all the adults battling covid-19. Philadelphia hospitals are once again barring family visitors due to transmission worries. And in Los Angeles, a public hospital canceled elective and scheduled surgeries because it cannot spare ICU beds. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Mounting hospitalizations in these and other states are pushing some hospital systems to near breaking points, with many scrambling to reconfigure themselves to handle a crush of patients streaming in after holiday gatherings and the arrival of flu season.

Hospitals reported more than 110,000 coronavirus patients on each of the past two days, a record count for the pandemic, according to tracking by The Washington Post. That is more than three times the number they treated in September and nearly double that reported at the height of the spring surge.

In hard-hit California, officials activated a mutual aid program for coroners, designed to help local authorities cope with “mass fatality.” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said at a news conference Tuesday that the state had ordered 5,000 more body bags and 60 refrigerated storage units were on standby.

“I don’t want people to scare folks, but this is a deadly disease,” Newsom said. “And we need to be mindful of where we are in this current journey together, to the vaccine. We are not at the finish line.”

The southern region of California, which includes Los Angeles County, has emerged as one of the state’s bright-red hot spots, with 0.5 percent availability of intensive-care beds, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. Covid-19 patients at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, a 600-bed public hospital, have “blown past” its earlier record in July, said Brad Spellberg, the hospital’s chief medical officer. The hospital has 150 covid-19 patients and 50 in the ICU.

“This is not the time to come to us for a hangnail,” Spellberg said. The hospital still has the capacity to treat heart attacks, strokes, car crashes and other emergencies, he added, but that’s about it. Even when treating such patients, it may take longer than normal to find beds for them.

He said the hospital is a step away from crisis triage levels when people will be discouraged from coming to the hospital altogether.

In the last week, 18 states have set single-day records in patients hospitalized for covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as cases soar all over the country.

Besides California, mounting cases and hospitalizations in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina continue to push some regions and hospital systems to crisis conditions, while the Upper Midwest and Plains states are finally seeing plateaus.

“Now the entire country is one big red hot zone,” said Arizona Medical Association President Ross Goldberg. “That red map that shows the really bad places for covid — now it’s just red.”

That the current surge is so widespread means health-care systems have not been able to share the burden as they have in the past. Those in rural areas, in particular, have been grappling with overflow conditions because some of their larger partners in urban centers have stopped accepting transfers. Such facilities are dependent on formal or informal partnerships with other institutions to handle critically ill patients after decades of financial challenges forced many to close or greatly reduce their intensive care units.

Many have only one ventilator for the entire facility and they are typically only used short-term — for a few hours or a day — until the patient can be sent to another facility. This process helped streamline operations in normal times, but has become a major vulnerability during the pandemic.

“Efficiency has been the mantra for health-care systems over the last decade but those efficiencies don’t work well in a pandemic,” said Brock Slabach, senior vice president for the National Rural Health Association.

That situation has left communities that might have only one ambulance without one for whole days so that people who suffer heart attacks or strokes may not have access to first responders, he said.

“Some in the public may think, ‘Well, I don’t have covid so this doesn’t affect me,’ ” Slabach said, “but this situation is unfortunately impacting all medical conditions now. We’re seeing a tremendous stretching of our entire emergency medical system’s capacity.”

With outbreaks in a local nursing home and prison, Norton County, Kan., with a population of 5,400, has seen some of the nation’s highest per capita rates of infection this fall. The 25-bed Norton County Hospital has had to greatly expand the distance it sends patients as the larger systems that typically take its patients have intermittently turned them away, said community relations director Katie Allen Wagner.

Normally, the hospital sends patients needing a higher level of care an hour and-a-half away by ambulance to Hays Medical Center, a regional hub that is so packed that it turned away more than 100 patients in November alone. Now, as a result, Norton County Hospital must send critical patients three-and-a-half hours away Wichita as well as to Omaha, which is five hours away. One patient was sent all the way to Denver, six hours away.

“There are a lot of other hospitals just like us in our situation,” Wagner said.

For health-care systems large and small, officials say staffing is the biggest challenge, with health-care workers out sick themselves with coronavirus infections and nursing registries used in the past to find temporary workers now tapped out.

Julie Huron, president of the West Virginia Nurses Association, said many nurses have used up all of their paid time off, because they needed it earlier in the year to recover after catching the coronavirus. Some have launched crowdfunding petitions to help with medical bills incurred as patients themselves. Others are “relying on the good nature of their providers to give them samples of inhalers.”

In North Carolina, which for the past three days has set daily records for the number of hospitalized covid-19 patients, nursing staff is the No. 1 concern, said Tatyana Kelly, vice president of planning and strategy at the North Carolina Healthcare Association.

“There’s no pool to pull from,” either from within the state or among its neighbors, she said. “Our front-line workers are exhausted and have been at maximum response for months on end.”

Ten months into the pandemic, that sense of exhaustion was echoed among many front-line workers struggling to keep on through what has become the pandemic’s darkest stretch.

Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, described the surge in patients like the waves coming in over and over — and over — again at the Bay of Fundy which is known for its high tides. She said several of the system’s 10 hospitals are so overstretched that staff have spent the past week calling patients to cancel non-urgent appointments past the new year.

“The problem is all the numbers indicate we are very early in the surge,” Mills said. “We are very worried about what things are going to look like in three to four weeks.”

Lewis Kaplan, head of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, said he and his colleagues say this surge feels different because some believe the country is no longer “all in this together.” He said there is palpable frustration that so many Americans are flouting public health guidelines, coupled with unspeakable grief over having to watch so many patient deaths they consider needless.

“After having spent so many months dealing with all the pandemic-related things without a break, you’re now asked to do it once more,” he said. “That’s part of our commitment as doctors, and yet a not-very-small part of you asks, ‘Did it have to be this way?’ And in your heart of hearts you’re sure it really didn’t.”

There are many regulations for travel abroad during the pandemic, especially for Americans, amid rising coronavirus cases. If you do need to travel, or are considering making a trip abroad, it can be hard to find the most up-to-date information on entry requirements for both your destination and your home base, as country-specific regulations are frequently changing to reflect quickly shifting coronavirus trends.

But several months into the pandemic, more detailed tools for monitoring restrictions on travel by country are emerging. And Skyscanner’s interactive covid-19 travel map is perhaps the most detailed option.

Accessible through Skyscanner’s homepage, the restrictions map is in beta, and it can be set to different origin countries to display varying restrictions. Color-coded, it displays low-restriction, moderate-restriction and major-restriction destinations in stoplight-style green, yellow and red. Countries without data on their restrictions, as well as the origin country, appear in gray.

Clicking through to specific destinations, or scrolling down to see a curated list of the ones you can visit, yields the most current information on quarantine restrictions, coronavirus case rate, the change in cases from the prior week, and the option to sign up for email updates on the country’s coronavirus situation.

The tool launched in November, and uses data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for the travel restrictions as well as Johns Hopkins University coronavirus data for case rates.

Skyscanner launched the interactive map in response to a survey of Americans the website conducted about attitudes surrounding travel restrictions. Of the 1,000 respondents surveyed, 51 percent of said they did not feel confident about their knowledge of where they could and could not travel.

Despite this, many are still searching for international airfare.

“People want to travel and we know there is pent-up demand from the searches we are seeing for flights and for more information; but confidence has been hit by the lack of consistency between countries worldwide regarding measures and restrictions,” Mark Crossey, U.S. travel expert for Skyscanner, said in a statement. “Consumers just don’t understand the complex rules and are crying out for transparent, detailed information.”

Americans can easily see from the map that they have very few options for quarantine-free travel: Only 13 nations are green; 212 are orange or red.

Crossey also says the map is only “one piece of the puzzle,” and global uniformity in quarantine and testing requirements will be required for a strong return to travel.

Until then, maps like this one will aim to bridge the gap between complex travel restrictions and travelers.

If the devastation of losing your job because of the coronavirus pandemic isn’t enough, imagine being conned by scammers capitalizing on the spread of covid-19 and your desperation to generate some income. If you have a personal finance question for Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary, please call 1-855-ASK-POST (1-855-275-7678) ArrowRight Income-based scams have increased significantly because of the pandemic. In the first nine months of 2020, people looking for ways to earn money were cheated out of $150 million, according to new data from the Federal Trade Commission.

“Scammers have been even bolder during the covid-19 pandemic,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “So many of us are unemployed or underemployed, stuck at home and badly in need of income. In fact, the number of income scams reported to the FTC reached the highest level on record in the second quarter of 2020. These scammers are taking advantage of a desperate situation to rip money from the hands of those of us least able to afford it.”

In a crackdown the authorities are calling “Operation Income Illusion,” the FTC — along with 19 federal, state and local law enforcement partners — is focusing on shutting down fake employment, work-at-home, multilevel marketing and investment scams.

In Maryland, Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) announced enforcement actions against several companies pitching franchise opportunities. In another scheme, promoters targeted members of the African immigrant community, promising huge returns on their investments in a cryptocurrency, a highly risky proposition even when it’s a legitimate investment.

“The past year has been especially difficult for many families who’ve lost their source of income due to the covid pandemic,” Frosh said during a news conference call. “In some cases, families are desperate to make ends meet, pay for much-needed health care or simply put food on the table. And, in addition to all the other pain this pandemic has caused, it made many Americans become especially vulnerable to income scams and unwise investment opportunities.”

The FTC has taken legal action against a number of bogus income cons, many of which are just preposterous.

— A Florida-based scam lured people in by promising they could earn between $500 and $12,500 in commissions in a digital income scheme. People paid for various levels of membership — $1,000 to $25,000 — and in return they could “earn” the right to make money off the recruitment of other people into the program. For example, someone paying $1,000 for an entrepreneur-level membership could make $500 if another person was sold a membership at that same level. There were no products involved or services offered. As I read how the scam worked, I was wondering how anyone could fall for it. But desperation can make you susceptible to what appears to be an easy way to make money.

— One scam targeted Latina consumers with a work-at-home scheme in which they would resell luxury products such as brand-name perfumes. Victims were told they could earn up to $1,000 a week. The scammers targeted “Latina consumers in the midst of the covid-19 health and economic crisis. . . seizing on economic insecurity in the community,” the FTC complaint said.

— An investment scheme targeting retirees and older adults promised they could double or triple their money in one week by taking advantage of “secret trading techniques” tied to opportunities related to the pandemic.

— Another bogus work-at-home scam claimed an affiliation with Amazon. None existed, of course. When the pandemic began, the scammers targeted people who had lost their jobs, hitting them with robocalls that allegedly said the company could offer them an opportunity to work from home and make up to $400 a day.

“As these cases show, the financial fallout of the pandemic has increased both financial distress and opportunities for scammers,” Smith said.

In announcing the enforcement actions, the FTC said it has created a new consumer education campaign about income-based scams. You can find more information at ftc.gov/incomescams.

Here’s what you can do to protect yourself from a covid-19-related income scam, according to the FTC.

— Slow down. If you find a business opportunity, take your time to investigate it. Don’t make a decision during the presentation. “High-pressure sales pitches are always a big red flag,” Smith said. I can second that. I’ve sat in on many bogus work-at-home or investment opportunity meetings. My reporting led to the shutdown of one. Here’s what I found as a sign the business opportunity wasn’t legit: The more questions I asked, the more agitated and defensive the promoter got. So ask a lot of questions.

— Don’t believe the hype of success stories or testimonials. “Our experience shows us that glowing stories can be fake, and online reviews can be made up,” Smith said.

— Skip the research and you’re more likely to be victimized. Promoters of pandemic-related scams know you’re in a hurry to make money. So they count on you not vetting their claims. Something as simple as an online search can save you from a scam. Search for the company’s name and add the words, “review,” “scam” or “complaint” to your online inquiry. “Finding no complaints doesn’t mean the company is legitimate,” Smith said, “but complaints can tip you off to possible problems.”

Roy Dunlap told his family his plans as they sat down to a dinner of salmon, greens and white rice. “I’m going to take the vaccine tomorrow,” the director of environmental services at Howard University Hospital said. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight His 17-year-old son’s eyes bulged and he raised his eyebrows to the heavens, as he typically does when his father says something out of the ordinary. Then the teenager looked at his mother.

“What do you mean?” Dunlap remembers his wife saying. “Your family needs you. Let somebody else take it.”

But Dunlap had already made up his mind to get the coronavirus vaccine. He thought about the number of people who have died of covid-19, including one of the cleaning workers he supervised at the hospital.

He recognized the importance of getting vaccinated, and wanted to be a leader for not only his staff of 70 people — who clean and disinfect every part of the hospital, including the covid-19 rooms — but also his community.

Convincing Black Americans scarred by generations of health-care discrimination to trust the vaccine is a crucial part of ending the pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted Black Americans, Latinos and front-line workers.

And so on Tuesday, despite his family’s worries, Dunlap became one of the first seven employees at Howard hospital to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, sitting straight up in his chair as white-coated, masked and face-shielded Frank Evans, a licensed practical nurse at the hospital, inserted the needle into his right arm.

Howard is one of six sites that received part of the District’s initial shipment of 6,825 doses of the vaccine. They arrived Monday morning, as the total number of coronavirus cases reported in the greater Washington region climbed above 540,000, and the death toll in the District, Maryland and Virginia exceeded 10,200.

Officials at the historically Black institution hope that publicizing the vaccination process will encourage other people to get vaccinated, especially Black Americans, who are nearly three times as likely to die of covid-19 because of health-care disparities and increased exposure at jobs deemed essential.

Many have told researchers and community leaders they do not plan to take the vaccine because of a history of medical mistreatment and because of the politicization of the vaccine development process.

“We will take the vaccine not to jump in line, but to show people and to help people understand this is a safe weapon against the scourge of covid that has just been taking lives, day after day,” Anita Jenkins, the chief executive of the hospital, said before getting her shot.

Howard University College of Medicine, founded three years after the end of the Civil War to train doctors to care for newly freed Black people in the nation’s capital, is working alongside the nation’s three other Black medical colleges to build community confidence in the vaccine.

Howard University set up coronavirus testing sites early on in the pandemic in Ward 7 and Ward 8, which have the city’s largest populations of Black Americans. And Howard’s medical school and hospital will soon be running the clinical trial of a vaccine that has yet to reach the market, spokeswoman Alonda Thomas said.

“We have a legacy of leadership in science and developing insights into new science approaches to treating health, and in applying science to the benefit of people of color,” said Reed Tuckson, a doctor and Howard University trustee who is the founder of the Black Coalition Against COVID-19.

Tuesday’s vaccinations, he added, were “a further example of this history.”

Shelly McDonald-Pinkett, the hospital’s chief medical officer, who got vaccinated just before Dunlap, said: “We’ve all heard the statistics about what happens in the African American community and communities of color. And so it’s important for those who are in leadership roles to demonstrate our willingness to take the vaccine.”

Dunlap was eager to do so. He said he decided to get the vaccine weeks ago, after Jenkins announced she was going to be vaccinated.

“The early stage [of the pandemic] was really rough for me, so that’s why I felt that I had to be at the forefront to lead,” Dunlap said.

The housekeeper who died of covid-19 did not contract the virus at the hospital, Dunlap said. In all, 10 of his staff members have tested positive, Dunlap said. Some workers quit, some refused to clean rooms inhabited by virus patients. His hours, and those of his remaining staff, grew longer.

The virus disrupted his personal life as well; among other things, he was unable to travel to Florida for the funeral of a pastor who was one of his childhood mentors and had died of cancer.

“I feel this day is historic because this is the beginning stages of making covid-19 decline,” Dunlap said after being vaccinated. “And somebody has to be the guinea pig. Somebody has to be the front line to volunteer and everything to see if the vaccine works.”

His wife was not easily convinced, however. Tuesday morning, before Dunlap headed to work, she stopped him and asked if they could pray.

“And so she prayed with me. That kind of gave me more ease, that God got it,” Dunlap said.

After the shots were given, and the crowd cleared out of the hospital’s Freedmen’s Hall, Dunlap began preparing the area for his staff to come in and do the essential work they’ve been doing every day during this pandemic: thoroughly disinfecting the area to curb the spread of the deadly disease.

A cluster of 26 new cases of the coronavirus on the Caribbean island of Grenada has been linked to a Sandals resort, Grenada’s Ministry of Health said in a statement Sunday. Sandals Grenada is closed to all new guests while officials test and contact trace resort guests and employees. Grenada officials moved on Monday to impose a partial lockdown amid the island’s new rise in cases.

Before the weekend spike of coronavirus cases, the nation had recorded a total of 45 confirmed cases since March. The island’s previous peak for a daily total was six cases, according to the World Health Organization.

The 26 positive cases linked to the resort “include guests and employees, as well as their contacts,” the Health Ministry statement said. “The discovery was made following proactive testing of employees and guests on Friday and Saturday, as part of the Ministry’s continuous testing of front-line staff in sectors directly related to tourism, travel and health.”

Advertisement

Acting chief medical officer Shawn Charles said in a news conference that they expect the case count to grow as they continue testing close contacts of the positive guests and employees.

Due to the new rise in cases, the government of Grenada also announced on Monday that it will now limit all gatherings to 10 people, require businesses to close by 10 p.m., and limit restaurants and bars to takeout only.

Prime Minister Keith Mitchell gave a public address Monday about the new measures, and he said that 13 of the Sandals-linked cases live in the same household as a Sandals Grenada staff member. He also said officials are working to determine if the resort breached health protocols.

“The Ministry of Health is revisiting the protocols for all hotels and resorts,” Mitchell said. “The magnitude of this new cluster of cases means it is not business as usual during this holiday season.”

A spokesperson for Sandals Resorts said in an email that the resort remains “open for current guests to enjoy"" and that quarantine measures are being strictly enforced so that ""there is zero risk to the rest of the resort’s operations.”

“Out of an abundance of caution, we are not accepting new guests at this time and are working with them to accommodate their travel plans to another one of our resorts in the Caribbean region,"" the spokesperson said. ""We will evaluate this policy in the coming days once findings are complete.”

Grenada currently requires all visitors to obtain a negative coronavirus test less than 72 hours before arrival, and it states in its Ministry of Health guidelines: “Health experts believe that people getting tested within 72 hours of travel will help to lessen potentially positive diagnoses after travellers enter the island. The closer the period is between testing and flight, the less time individuals will have to contract the virus in their communities of origin before boarding the flight.”

“The Government’s first responsibility is to protect the lives of our people, and we are resolute in taking all necessary steps to do so,” Grenada’s Health Ministry said. “This outbreak can be contained, if we all work together.”

Mitt Romney is a Republican senator from Utah. Joe Manchin is a Democratic senator from West Virginia. Coming off the most bitter, divisive presidential election (and post-election) in modern American history, expectations have been understandably low for Congress’s ability to agree on anything — even another round of covid-19 relief. Progress has been nonexistent for several months, with talks at an impasse between a comprehensive $2.2 trillion stimulus package put forth by Democrats and a much more targeted $500 billion bill proposed by Republicans. These proposals were denounced and dismissed by the opposing party as dead on arrival.

In mid-November, after months of stagnation, a small group of senators — four Republicans and four Democrats — convened for a socially distanced dinner hosted by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). In addition to breaking bread, we traded ideas on how to break the stalemate. We agreed to keep talking. What followed became a marathon: four weeks of hours-long Zoom calls, often multiple times a day, with the goal of crafting an emergency relief bill. We always understood that our bill was not going to be the final answer, but we knew it would be necessary to carry the American people through the early spring and prevent our nation’s health-care crisis from becoming an economic catastrophe.

We started with the emergency priorities we agreed on — including some measures in the Cares Act that were set to expire this month. Millions of Americans lost their jobs this year through no fault of their own, and with pandemic unemployment assistance running out as the virus rages on, jobless Americans and their families are set to lose a critical lifeline right before the holidays. We agreed there should be an extension. And there was unanimity on the need to provide sufficient funding to ensure efficient distribution of covid-19 vaccines, support testing and tracing programs, and support front-line health-care workers.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) saved an estimated 2.3 million jobs and kept the lights on for thousands of small businesses during months of slashed revenue. With many shops, restaurants and mom-and-pop stores on the brink of closure again as new lockdowns and restrictions loom, there was consensus on jumpstarting PPP to allow those hit hardest to apply for a second forgivable loan.

We divided ourselves into smaller working groups to finesse the details of each section. We found additional agreement on funding for transportation, emergency assistance to keep food on the table, education, rental assistance and extending student-loan forbearance.

Finally, we stayed firm on keeping the price tag of this emergency relief bill at about $900 billion — a significant departure from the $2.2 trillion package that Democrats proposed before the election but more than the $500 billion package offered by Senate Republicans. In other words, a compromise.

Two sticking points remained. Unsurprisingly, they were the same issues that had long stalled negotiations: funding for state, local and tribal governments; and liability protections for businesses, schools and health-care facilities. Given that this disagreement had persisted for nearly six months, there was no easy way out.

After weeks of negotiating, it became clear that our “908 coalition” was really two groups. Everyone agreed on $748 billion to extend emergency assistance for the unemployed, pass another round of PPP, and provide rental assistance and funding for vaccines. A second, smaller group supported taking the additional step of compromising on $160 billion in aid for state, local and tribal governments in exchange for liability protections for employers, small businesses, nonprofits, schools and churches. With bipartisan agreement solidifying on the $748 billion portion, the smaller group was determined to find an acceptable solution as well.

In the end, we reached a bipartisan compromise. The outcome of our discussions is a two-part emergency relief package: a $748 billion bill that meets the emergency needs of the nation. It funds a second round of small-business assistance; extends unemployment assistance for 16 weeks with a $300 weekly federal supplement; and includes necessary funding for testing, tracing and vaccine distribution. A separate package includes $160 billion in state, local and tribal funding, and liability protections for businesses, schools, churches and health-care facilities.

We realize that the smaller bill will not be popular in our respective parties. Each of us agreed on including a provision we would not have supported on its own. We believe that the only way to get one is to allow both — or we’re left with nothing. It’s not perfect, but no compromise is.

In addition to our bipartisan, bicameral legislation, these talks revealed an important truth: that, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is possible to find areas of common interest and to compromise in good faith without violating our principles. We don’t doubt that this legislation will have its critics, but we are confident that it provides the emergency covid-19 relief our nation desperately needs to get us all through the early spring. We urge Senate and House leadership and the White House to take up our bipartisan legislation now. Congress should not leave town before passing an emergency covid-19 relief package.

Think of someone you love unconditionally. Choose the person who makes your heart fill with joy at a thought: Is it your child, your parent, your partner, your closest friend? Say their name to yourself, take a slow deep breath and close your eyes.

Now picture that person in a hospital bed. Machines are beeping. Your person is unconscious, on a ventilator. The machine is forcing air into their chest, making it rise and fall steadily. The nurse tells you your person spends 21 hours a day on their stomach, but they are upright today because today is their day.

Sometimes the machine sounds an alert because your person is fighting against the ventilator, trying to still maintain some independence. It suddenly feels so morbid to think how casually we all say “so-and-so was a fighter.”

Picture yourself next to your person, holding a cold, limp hand. It feels heavy because you are doing all the lifting. You catch a glimpse of your own reflection in the window and see a full-body paper suit, surgical gloves, an N95 mask and a face shield. A few minutes ago, the nurses asked you your glove size and you didn’t know how to answer, so now your gloves feel too tight.

[Leer en español: Cómo es ver morir a un ser querido por COVID-19]

You realize the staff is telling you how to prepare for your person’s “transition.” That’s a nice way of saying your person is going to die. Right now. And you will be there when it happens. You already feel guilty because, between the deep ache in your chest, you feel an odd comfort knowing they won’t be in any pain anymore.

You think back to the 10 days before your person was put on a ventilator. They couldn’t get enough of a breath to relay a verbal will, so the two of you played a game of yes-or-no questions to give your person a chance to lay out their thoughts and end-of-life wishes without wasting air.

Boom, you are back in the intensive care unit with an overwhelming cacophony of beeping. The medical team tells you to look away as they remove the ventilator, and you notice they are making noise to prevent you from hearing your person choking and gasping for air. Then, the room goes quiet. They have turned off the machines so that the beeps and alarms don’t further upset you. The data does not matter anymore.

A moment later, you become desperate to tell your person everything you think they need to hear before they die. Your mind panics, and you already feel guilty about all that you have and haven’t said.

Your person gasps. You look at the nurse who assures you it’s normal and apologizes for something your person has just done. Immediately, you are jealous, or resentful, because this nurse knows your person more than you do right now.

The nurse tells you your person is gone and shares their condolences. The words mean nothing as your world numbs. You thank them anyway. Suddenly, you don’t know whether to stay or go. Someone has to re-explain to you the strict protocol on removing protective equipment. You must remove the too-tight gloves first, but don’t touch anything. There is an order to it, and you are scared to deviate because you have people you love in the outside world whom you need to keep safe. You walk out, alone.

My experience was on Friday, Nov. 13. My person was my dad.

George Finefrock, in a 1994 photo. (Sarah Finefrock/Family photo)

His name is George. His name was George. He was funny and giving, and frustrated me at times, and he was overly proud of my brother and me. He wore a mask, and he died of covid-19.

George made an impression on people he knew. To know him was to laugh with him. So why have I spent the past few days worried he will be just a number the news shares each night? More than 1,300 Americans died of covid-19 on Nov. 13. I worry George will be another anonymous statistic presented through jokes and memes about how awful 2020 was. I need George’s death to mean something to strangers, just as much as you would want the person you loved most to matter if they died.

All I can do now — the only path left for me — is tell you to take covid-19 seriously. Don’t end up clutching your person’s hand as their body no longer accepts air.

Daniel Uhlfelder was so alarmed about the risks of Florida reopening its beaches during the coronavirus pandemic that he decided to haunt them. Dressed as a scythe-wielding Grim Reaper, the Walton County lawyer toured the state’s northwest coast in March, offering a dire warning that drew national attention. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Meanwhile, he was also taking his message to the courts, suing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and calling on judges to force him to issue a statewide stay-at-home order and close all beaches.

But after that case and an appeal were dismissed earlier this year, the governor’s lawyers have recently urged an appeals court to sanction Uhlfelder. His lawsuit against DeSantis, they argue, was a form of “empty political posturing” that “warrants repercussions.”

“The many hours spent by this Court and the attorneys of the Executive Office of the Governor on this appeal could have been spent on innumerable other pressing matters related to the health, welfare, and safety of Floridians,” Joshua E. Pratt, an assistant general counsel in DeSantis’s office, wrote in a legal filing on Friday in a state appeals court.

Uhlfelder, however, said the governor’s attorneys are trying to punish him for having the audacity to challenge DeSantis — a move he says he made to protect his home state from a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people nationwide, including at least 20,000 Floridians.

“This is not about me. It’s about citizens having the right to challenge government when they’re not doing the right thing,” Uhlfelder, 48, told The Washington Post early Tuesday. “To say that I distracted from his job is laughable, considering he hasn’t done his job.”

DeSantis’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Tuesday.

As the coronavirus has ravaged Florida, Uhlfelder is hardly the only person to criticize DeSantis’s handling of the pandemic. Dozens of people involved in the state’s response told The Post this summer that the governor’s decisions were increasingly shaped by politics and divorced from scientific evidence.

Since then, DeSantis has pledged not to institute a statewide mask mandate or order lockdowns, even as infections have surged, and faced a rash of criticism of his personal behavior.

He and his family were photographed last Friday night, all with their faces exposed, as part of a largely maskless crowd at a high school football game. On Monday evening, he also held a holiday reception for state lawmakers at the governor’s mansion, despite warnings from federal health officials about large gatherings.

Early in the pandemic, Uhlfelder made headlines as he pressed the case, while cloaked in black on the sand, that DeSantis needed to act faster to protect Florida. A practicing lawyer for more than two decades, he said the stunt was merely another way to draw attention to a point he was also making in court.

His March lawsuit contended that DeSantis, who was then refusing a shutdown, should be required to implement restrictions. (DeSantis would later institute a temporary “safer at home” order, although beaches closed only at the behest of local governments.)

Leon County Circuit Judge Kevin Carroll rejected the lawsuit on April 7, in part siding with an argument from DeSantis’s lawyers: “Second-guessing” the governor’s decisions would violate the separation of powers between the three branches of government, as established by the Constitution, he ruled.

“What I’m being asked to do is substitute my judgment for that of the governor’s on how to respond to this COVID crisis,” Carroll told Uhlfelder during the trial, according to the News Service of Florida. “There are 599 circuit judges in Florida at last count, and I don’t think we need to have 599 governors-in-waiting.”

But as Uhlfelder pointed out Tuesday, Carroll also encouraged him to appeal the case to a higher court, noting: “I do think this is a matter of importance.” The judge added that Uhlfelder had “an understandable concern” that he had “raised in good faith,” the lawyer would later note in legal filings.

Uhlfelder filed an appeal on April 9 — this time, alleging DeSantis had failed to “comply with his constitutional and statutory duties” and noting gubernatorial measures in other states had been challenged in court.

Again, Uhlfelder’s case was dismissed. A three-judge panel on Florida’s First District Court of Appeals, including one judge appointed by DeSantis, wrote on Nov. 13 that his case did not “demonstrate even an arguable legal basis for reversal.”

They also characterized his appeal and supporting documents as “frivolous and/or filed in bad faith” and asked Uhlfelder to explain why he should not face sanctions for pursuing the case.

Advertisement

On Friday, the governor’s legal team said that Uhlfelder’s appeal constituted an “axiomatic example of abuse of the justice system” that “diverted time and energy from the demands of pandemic response.”

The court has yet to make a final decision on sanctions, which could mean paying legal fees for the other side.

Uhlfelder said regardless of the decision, he viewed the governor’s move in support of sanctions as an attempt to chill opposition to his pandemic response. Last week, he noted, police officers raided the home of Rebekah Jones, an ousted Florida Health Department data scientist who had accused the state of mismanaging the pandemic.

“When you have immense power as the governor of the third-largest state, it shouldn’t be used to try to silence or punish your rivals,” he said.

The scammers follow current events and create schemes accordingly. So, expect more scams involving coronavirus vaccines. The United States has begun the distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech novel coronavirus vaccine to help prevent the spread of the virus, which has killed nearly 300,000 Americans. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization to the first vaccine in the United States last week. A second vaccine, developed by Moderna, is expected to get FDA authorization soon.

States will determine who will get immunized first, with health-care personnel, nursing home residents and their caregivers prioritized as vulnerable populations. But the anticipated delay in distribution to the general population is enough to allow scammers to slip in with fake offers to people hoping to jump the line to get vaccinated.

“While we wait for a timeline and more information, there’s no doubt scammers will be scheming,” Colleen Tressler, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), wrote in a recent blog post about coronavirus-related cons.

The FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Inspector General have also been issuing alerts about the increase in coronavirus fraud as consumer and government agencies ramp up their efforts to protect the public from predators looking to make money off people’s fears about getting the virus.

Scammers aren’t just using email or telemarketing calls. They are also coming at people via messages on social media platforms, and they’re even performing door-to-door visits, HHS says.

Tressler said this is what you need to know to avoid a coronavirus-vaccine-related scam:

— Be skeptical of offers to pay for a vaccine on your behalf. Because the coronavirus is a public health emergency, it’s unlikely you will have to pay for the vaccine. “You should also beware of scammers claiming to be medical professionals and demanding payment for treating a friend or relative for COVID-19,” the FBI warns.

— No, you can’t pay to get your name on a list to get the coronavirus vaccine. Don’t fall for scammers’ promises about getting early access.

— No, that’s not a government official calling you about getting vaccinated. “No one from a vaccine distribution site or health care payer, like a private insurance company, will call you asking for your Social Security number or your credit card or bank account information to sign you up to get the vaccine,” Tressler wrote.

— Watch out for offers of alternative cures for the coronavirus. While waiting for a vaccine, don’t get so impatient that you become a victim of a scam. If you’re concerned about when you can get vaccinated, check with your health-care provider.

And if you fall victim to a scam, report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov or file a complaint with the FTC’s consumer protection office. The agencies may not be able to investigate your individual situation, but if enough people complain, the scammers could be shut down.

“Don’t pay for a promise of vaccine access or share personal information,” Tressler wrote.

Reader Question of the Week

If you have a personal finance or retirement question, send it to colorofmoney@washpost.com. In the subject line, put “Question of the Week.” Please note that questions may be edited for clarity.

Q: Is it true that if you didn’t qualify for a stimulus payment for 2018 or 2019 but your income dropped this year, you can qualify for a payment next year? Because under the Cares Act we didn’t have to take a required minimum distribution from our retirement account for 2020, our joint income is much less than in 2019.

Advertisement

A: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) Act provides economic impact payments or stimulus payments of up to $1,200 for individuals and up to $2,400 for taxpayers filing a joint tax return.

To quickly distribute the funds, the IRS went back two years — to 2018 and 2019 — to pull tax returns to determine if people were eligible for a stimulus payment.

But what many people don’t realize is the stimulus payment is an advance credit for 2020. If you didn’t qualify for a payment because you earned too much in whichever tax return the IRS used (again, either 2018 or 2019), you may be able to claim the credit next year and receive a stimulus payment based on your 2020 income.

To recap, the amount of the rebate stimulus credit is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI), which is your gross income minus specific deductions or adjustments. Here are the income limits to receive the maximum stimulus payment:

Advertisement

— Up to $75,000/single or married filing separately: $1,200.

— Up to $112,500/head of household: $1,200.

— Up to $150,000/married couples filing joint return: $2,400.

Reduced payments are available if your AGI falls between the following ranges:

— $75,000 and $99,000/single or married filing separately.

— $112,500 and $136,500/head of household.

— $150,000 and $198,000/ married filing jointly.

Payments are reduced by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000/$112,500/$150,000 thresholds.

Rep.-elect Bob Good took the stage at Freedom Plaza on Saturday afternoon and looked out at a sea of masklessness. Thousands had come to march for President Trump — some carrying signs declaring the novel coronavirus a hoax. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight They were just the kind of group, Good told the crowd, who “gets that this is a phony pandemic.”

“It’s a serious virus, but it’s a virus. It’s not a pandemic,” said Good (R), who will become Virginia’s newest congressman in the 5th Congressional District on Jan. 3. “It’s great to see your faces. You get it. You stand up against tyranny.”

Good’s denial of the existence of a pandemic flies in the face of an unprecedented surge in coronavirus infections, which have claimed the lives of nearly 300,000 Americans — including more than 300 in Good’s congressional district, according to a Washington Post analysis of coronavirus data.

Hospitalizations are up 18 percent in Virginia since last week, and experts fear an increase in fatalities will soon follow.

But Good continued to encourage masklessness and reject the need for any restrictions in a string of Twitter statements on Sunday, in which he noted that the 300,000 deaths represented “less than 1/10th of 1% of Americans.”

The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, stressing that a pandemic is not triggered by a certain level of death or destruction but by worldwide spread.

Good could not immediately be reached for comment Monday. On Sunday, he suggested that coronavirus precautions were a “hoax” that would not impact who lived or died, while comparing the risk of catching the virus to the risk of getting in a car crash. He noted that the government does not ban cars — but he did not address seat-belt laws, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly pushed in the 1960s to minimize deaths in crashes.

“We have got to stop the insanity, and stop accepting the hoax that says forcing people to wear a mask, forcing businesses to close, prohibiting worship services, and keeping kids out of school will make a significant difference in whether or not we will die from this virus,” Good wrote on Twitter.

His Democratic opponent, Cameron Webb, a doctor who treats covid-19 patients at the University of Virginia Medical Center, called Good’s rhetoric “irresponsible and dangerous.”

“I’ve seen firsthand the devastation COVID-19 causes,” Webb posted on Twitter.

As the virus has raged through Virginia in recent weeks, at least one elected official who was skeptical of restrictions changed his view after getting sick.

In Hillsville, in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Mayor Greg Crowder took to Facebook after testing positive, expressing regret that he had not taken the virus seriously.

Advertisement

“I bragged about how I hadn’t let this virus [change] my life,” he wrote Dec. 8, after running a fever as high as 104 for a week. “I can tell you it has now. I never could imagine how bad a muscle and joints could hurt . . . I’m sharing this so maybe someone with the mind set I had will give the virus the respect that it deserves, not to fear it but respect it. [Wear] your mask when out, wash hands every chance you get.”

Gov. Ralph Northam (D) read Crowder’s post at a news conference Thursday. On Friday, the mayor posted that he’d gone to the hospital but was sent home, and that his fever later spiked to 107.

“After seeing what condition our health facilities are in right now is beyond pure frightening. Every hospital in the area is overflowing,” he wrote. “They said they would like to keep me but didn’t have room.”

Advertisement

On Sunday, a note on his Facebook page said he’d been admitted to the hospital overnight. The message asked for prayers.

Good showed disdain for virus precautions throughout his campaign, opting not to wear a mask or encourage them at his events, and saying businesses should not be restricted in the interest of limited spread.

When questioned by a reporter at an Oct. 22 rally about why he did not take precautions at the events, he said, “I think we’re all seeing conflicting information on whether or not masks help or hurt.” He did not cite evidence showing masks were harmful.

Good won the GOP nomination by defeating Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Va.) at a convention, attacking him as not conservative enough for the district after Riggleman officiated a same-sex wedding in 2019.

In an interview Monday, Riggleman called Good’s comments denying the pandemic “dangerous,” saying his own 83-year-old grandmother is hospitalized with the virus and pneumonia and his father and stepmother had it, too. So did his daughter’s boyfriend.

Advertisement

“When you put out disinformation like this, it goes from pandering to possibly endangering others,” Riggleman said. “There’s a pandemic. I think sometimes there’s an overreaction by governors, sometimes there’s an under-reaction by governors. But it doesn’t change the fact that there’s a pandemic.”

Good’s far-right platform, as an immigration hard-liner opposed to LGBTQ marriage equality, caused some division among Republicans in the district who had been loyal to Riggleman, who leans libertarian.

But the more right-wing factions of the party are increasingly breaking with the outgoing congressman, who was censured by a local GOP committee over the weekend for his role at the 2019 wedding between two of his campaign staffers.

The Appomattox County Republican Committee also unanimously censured Riggleman for criticizing Trump’s refusal to denounce the conspiracy-theory group QAnon; calling Trump’s claims of voter fraud false; and initially refusing to concede to Good in his own race. Riggleman had charged the convention was “rigged” because it took place in Good’s turf in Lynchburg — only a sliver of which is within the 5th District — at a church that has ties to Good.

Good — a former banker at CitiFinancial, wrestling coach and athletics fundraiser at Liberty University — was one of more than a dozen speakers Saturday at Freedom Plaza, where thousands gathered before marching to the Supreme Court to protest the justices’ rejection of a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn Trump’s loss in the presidential election.

Good alleged a vast, shadowy conspiracy perpetrated by Democrats to steal the election from Trump — claims for which there is no evidence and that have been rejected by scores of federal and state judges and Attorney General William P. Barr.

“How many votes did they steal? As many as they needed,” Good said.

Dec. 25 is my favorite day of every year. Since the beginning of my medical training, I have spent every Christmas with my family and, fortunately, never within the walls of a hospital. And while I still retain my uncontained excitement for the holiday I hold sacred, Christmas this year is tainted by feelings of fear and disappointment.

As a doctor in New York, I have worked in various intensive care units with patients with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, beginning in March during the height of the pandemic. We watched people die despite our best efforts, in isolation, unable to see their families. And today, ICUs all over the country are flooded with sick patients with covid-19, hospitals are short on staff and cases are only continuing to rise.

Yet, I still see people maskless on the subway or on crowded streets. Some are in denial, choosing to pretend that everything is normal. Others, perhaps, believe that they are invincible, but the virus does not discriminate.

Advertisement

And I recognize that we are tired. This year has been physically and emotionally exhausting for everyone, health-care providers in particular. We all are craving quality time with family and friends; we are craving something to rejoice and celebrate. Many of my colleagues have not seen their families in months. We have been deprived of so much interpersonal connection and human touch, hiding behind goggles, face shields, N95 masks and surgical masks. For many of us, those relationships and connections to our patients are the best part of working in health care.

But I’m also scared. I’m scared to expose my parents, my grandmother, or my fiance to the virus. I’m scared on behalf of the families of my future patients with covid-19. I’m scared of what’s going to happen during these next few months if people gather with their extended families for the holidays.

The spirit of Christmas is one that celebrates joy, love, compassion, generosity, kindness and sacrifice. Of course, we aim to demonstrate these virtues all year long, but the holiday season is an important reminder to us that we can be better. We must not falter.

Advertisement

This holiday season, I think about my father, an internist, dropping off a pulse oximeter outside the door of one of his older patients with suspected coronavirus infection during the height of the pandemic.

I thank the nurse practitioner whom I first met when we were redeployed to a newly constructed covid ICU who showed me how to care for the skin breakdown on my nose from the continuous wearing of N95 respirators.

I remember the doctors and other medical staff who traveled from Georgia, Montana, California and other places to help support us in the surge in New York.

At the same time, I reminisce about my long-standing patient with heart failure who never left her house and did everything right. She took all of her medications and spoke to me on the phone for her appointments. But despite her best efforts, she died in the emergency room of covid-19.

Advertisement

I reflect on the doctors, nurses and other health-care workers of all ages and backgrounds across the country who died of covid-19 while fighting on the front lines.

I recall the months I spent away from my fiance, both of us practicing medicine in two different states, trying our best to keep ourselves and our patients safe.

I think about the families who were devastated by covid-19, losing multiple family members and being unable to say goodbye because of visitation policies. I think about all of the empty seats at dinner tables, not just at the holidays but every night.

So although we are approaching the end of a long year, we must be vigilant. We may have to show our love for each other in different and unique ways this year.

One of the best ways we can show compassion and generosity is by keeping one another safe. Indoor holiday gatherings are high risk for spread.

Advertisement

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its recommendations regarding the holidays and covid-19, emphasizing the often underestimated role that small indoor family gatherings can have in spreading the virus. This is particularly risky when guests are drinking and eating without masks. Therefore, having a small dinner with immediate family (those who live in your household) is best and a small price to pay for the greater good.

So while our Christmas dinner will be much smaller this year, I am grateful that my loved ones are healthy.

Staying home and staying away may be the most powerful displays of love and Christmas spirit we have. Be generous. Be kind.

Wear a mask.

In April, the deadliest month of the pandemic, an elderly New Yorker in assisted living couldn’t grasp why she was suddenly forbidden to see her friends. In May, two sisters in Michigan, one Republican and the other a Democrat, watched their aged parents suffer from covid-19 and wondered why so many people refused to cover their faces against the virus.

In Florida in October, with 200,000 Americans already dead, a strong young man questioned how dire — how real — the whole crisis was. In wintry South Dakota last month, as the coronavirus hit home with an icy clarity, a man who understood the risk chose not to wear a mask. He just didn’t like being told what to do, his family said.

That man in South Dakota is dead. So is the young man in Florida. And the elderly parents in Michigan and the great-grandmother in New York. Nearly 300,000 Americans have now died of covid-19 — 50,000 of them in the past four weeks.

It took 2½ months for the virus to claim its first 50,000 Americans, then just one month for the death toll to climb to 100,000. The pace of death eased somewhat with warmer weather and more-concerted efforts to encourage mask use. But with the arrival of autumn and the holiday season, the virus surged anew in California, Texas and the South, and then in the Plains and the Midwest. Few safe havens remain.

Between late September and mid-November, the death tally climbed from 200,000 to 250,000. Now it has nearly reached the 300,000 marker in less than half that time — even though treatment of the most severe cases has improved.

The year of the coronavirus is ending much as the pandemic began, with overwhelmed hospitals and thousands of deaths each day. There is still no national plan for curbing the spread of the disease, just a hodgepodge of conflicting local and state approaches to everything from shutdowns to masking up.

The year’s third big wave comes as the nation braces for a winter of clashing winds — dark fatalism about the virus’s spread, widespread fatigue over anti-virus restrictions and growing hope that new vaccines could provide global relief.

At the center of that storm, there is a gutting yet unfathomable fact: Nearly 1 of every 1,000 Americans already has died of covid-19 — the equivalent of losing the entire population of cities such as Orlando, Pittsburgh or St. Louis. There have been more than twice as many American deaths as those killed in World War I. Five times as many as in the Vietnam War. One hundred times as many as in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The year of coronavirus has altered or diminished almost every American life. It has ended nearly 300,000 of them.

'A statistic'

When it started, when New York City became a dystopia of wailing ambulance sirens, refrigerator trucks loaded with bodies, and families living in fear of a hacking cough, Sofia Scharf was across the river from the city where she was born and raised. She was 95 and in an assisted-living facility in New Jersey, seven years into her dementia, her memory slipping but her spirit and body intact.

Nearly a century after she was born to Greek Jewish immigrants in a Lower East Side tenement, she played bingo and helped less-mobile residents when they spilled something at meals.

“The staff used to tease her that she would take their jobs away from them if she did too much,” said her daughter, Marissa Shedd, 67, the middle of three children.

Scharf often didn’t remember the other residents’ names, but she relished seeing them.

And then she couldn’t anymore. All residents at Sunrise of Edgewater were confined to their rooms to distance them from the reach of the virus.

The staff explained that Scharf couldn’t go out because of the virus’s alarming spread, but “she didn’t understand why she had to stay in her room,” Shedd said.

Staff members tried to make the separation easier, setting her up with video chats with her family, which just confused her more. “Why don’t you visit?” she asked them. “Come visit.”

The calls continued until Scharf fell ill. As she declined — her adult children honored her wish not to be sent to the hospital — her daughter battled her own covid-19 symptoms. Shedd felt so sick that she could barely talk to her mother. Shedd’s older sister, Davida Scharf, was allowed to say goodbye in person, from behind a shield of protective gear.

Sofia Scharf died at the home on April 10, about a week after she was diagnosed. Her husband, Ben, her companion of seven decades, had died three years earlier.

The couple had met while living in the same Bronx apartment building. They both served their country in World War II, he as a military code-breaker, she in a “Rosie the Riveter” manufacturing job.

Ben became an osteopath and established a practice on Long Island, where Sofia had a habit of packing a picnic and waking her brood early to get to Jones Beach by 8 a.m., before the crowds arrived. After her children were grown, she returned to school and became a medical technician.

In covid’s firestorm in April, there could be no in-person funeral, no shiva gathering. There was, instead, a memorial on Zoom. Scharf’s ashes were shipped to the veterans cemetery in Florida where Ben is at rest.

Eight months later, Shedd recalls her mother as a woman without “an ounce of crudeness or anger. She was very forgiving and just let life be, let people be how they wanted to be.”

Yet her daughter’s memories are forever clouded by the sadness and fear that saturated New York in those first weeks of the outbreak. It’s “a little strange being part of this group of people that died in nursing homes, and your parent is one of them,” Shedd said. “It’s like you become part of a statistic.”

'I love you'

By late May, when a maskless President Trump visited a Ford auto parts plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., that had been rejiggered to produce ventilators for covid patients, he had turned the decision to wear a face covering from a potentially lifesaving act of kindness into a partisan political statement.

By the time Trump came to town, William and Lillian Alcorn’s daughters shared a devotion to masks, even though the sisters were on opposite sides politically. Vada Brewington supported the president and Lillian Rose was counting the days until he could be sent packing, but they agreed on the virus: Do whatever it takes to beat it.

They masked up to protect their parents, even when Rose’s son, a 48-year-old paramedic who suffered his own bout of covid-19, insisted that the bug was no big deal. They became even more devoted to precautions when their own parents became the first residents of their assisted-living facility to contract the virus — and to die of it.

The Alcorns were into their 90s when their daughters concluded they needed more help and got them into an assisted-living facility. But when the virus hit Michigan hard in April — 13 members of their extended family would get covid — the daughters sensed trouble. Lillian, 93 and suffering from heart and thyroid issues, got sick first.

“I knew once it got hold of my mom, she probably wouldn’t survive,” said Rose, the younger daughter. Her mother lasted less than a week after going to the hospital.

Their father, who was 96 and had dementia, ended up in the same hospital, two floors away from his wife, but their daughters didn’t want William Alcorn to know his wife had died.

“We wanted my dad to fight, so we didn’t tell him, because he would have given up,” Rose said. The Alcorns had been together for 74 years.

William — who had worked the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Ypsilanti for 31 years and had a second career as a Baptist minister — remained in the hospital for nearly three weeks, and the daughters could occasionally get him on the phone.

“Dad, I love you,” Rose would tell her father. He’d give his standard reply, speaking for both parents: “We love you too.”

Within hours of their mother’s death, their father changed his answer.

“I love you, too,” he said, as if he knew Lillian was gone.

After three weeks, William was released from the hospital, but doctors said the virus had spread to his brain. He died at the assisted-living facility four days later.

The Alcorns’ funerals were restricted to 10 people, and Brewington, 73 and quarantining at home with heart and lung issues, couldn’t attend.

“For three weeks, I just lay here in bed and cried,” she said.

“Naming The Lost,” a 24-hour vigil live-streamed from May 20-21, read out the names of those lost to the coronavirus around the world. (Video: Naming The Lost)

Although Brewington had been largely isolated from everyone but her husband since March, they both came down with covid-19 in June. She’s better now, but still short of breath.

Rose, 68 and a former billing clerk at a hospital, also got covid, in November, though she, too, was religious about mask use.

“Sometimes I wear two,” she said. But her husband visited the VFW post for Veterans Day, and some people there wouldn’t cover their faces.

What the sisters didn’t see in May was how political the pandemic would become, how angry and righteous people would get. Brewington thinks Trump has “done the best he could” to combat the virus. Rose blames Trump for “brainwashing people and dividing us so deeply.”

But the sisters remain united on doing anything possible to curb the virus.

“I’ve tried to figure out why Trump is against the masks,” said Brewington, the Republican. “There’s no rhyme or reason that I can find.”

And they are united in their faith that their parents’ fate was up to a higher power.

“This was God’s way of taking Mom and Dad both at the same time,” Rose said.

“I put it in the Lord’s hands,” Brewington said. “If it’s my time to go, he’s going to take me. You never know how the Lord works.”

'A nightmare'

On a Sunday afternoon in late May, an administrator from the nursing home called LaWanna Bond. Her mother, Elizabeth Hawkins, had tested positive for the coronavirus.

This year had already heaped too much on Bond. Two months earlier, she had lost her brother, who died of what the coroner determined was a cocaine overdose.

Now, more than 100,000 Americans had died of covid and the person on the phone was saying that her mother — who was 68 years old and carried close to 250 pounds on her 5-foot, 8-inch frame — had contracted the virus.

“I just spoke with her and she didn’t mention it,” Bond told the administrator at the home in Stockton, Calif.

“Is she senile?” came the reply. “Sometimes people who are senile forget what they have just been told.”

Hawkins was not senile. Bond called her mother immediately.

The two talked every day, sometimes more than once. Bond, 46, and her five children would gather on FaceTime to stay close to Hawkins, whose kidney problems led her to move into the Golden Living Center — Hy-Pana in October 2019.

No one’s said anything about testing positive, Hawkins told her daughter.

“Have I?” Hawkins asked. “They did move my roommate out and all of them have masks on now.”

Three days later, another call, this one at 3 a.m., waking Bond from hard-won sleep.

“Your mother’s oxygen levels have dropped to a very low level,” the doctor said.

“Why haven’t you taken her to the hospital?” Bond asked.

“We need to hear from you first,” the doctor said.

Bond gave her approval, got out of bed. Within half an hour, she called the home again, and again, and again.

Finally, someone picked up: “Could you get my mother on the phone?” Bond asked.

“She is unresponsive,” the nurse said. “I’m sorry.”

Hawkins died at the start of a post-Memorial Day wave that pushed the U.S. death toll from 100,000 to 150,000 in two months. In California, the virus swept through nursing homes, killing dozens in some places. At the Golden Living Center, which has 119 beds, nearly 50 residents have tested positive and eight have died. Twenty-three staff members also contracted the virus.

Hawkins — who worked in the public schools as a safety monitor and then as a tow-truck dispatcher — was African American, a population that has suffered disproportionately from the virus. She was also obese for much of her adult life, a risk factor associated with lethal outcomes in covid cases.

The speed of her mother’s decline, the loneliness of any covid death — it was all too much for Bond. There had been no father in her childhood, and she had lost the centerpiece of her life. She dialed her mother’s voice mail all summer long, just to hear her voice, until the line was disconnected.

Bond has health insurance through Medicaid, but there were no savings for a funeral. Bond turned to her church, and parishioners donated $4,000 toward the cost.

“This is the first holiday without her, and I’m trying to be strong,” she said. “I have kids and I’m trying my best to keep it together for them.”

Bond said she needs her mother perhaps more than ever in her adult life. She has had to leave her customer service job with Cigna, a health insurance company, to care for her husband, Jederick, who has been diagnosed with colon cancer that has spread to his liver.

He is 53 years old. Doctors have given him weeks to live.

“This year,” Bond said, “has been a nightmare.”

'Didn't have to die'

By summer, coronavirus cases were spiraling out of control in Texas, halting the Sunday swirl of motion and music at San Pedro Springs Park in San Antonio, tearing Manuel “Manolo” Sanchez away from his danza practices, the weekly meditation that brought him closer to his ancestors and to the cosmic connection he sought with nature.

Sanchez’s dance group, Teokalli, tried virtual solutions, but gathering to practice via video chat proved cumbersome. There was nothing quite like their ceremonies: A bellowing blast of a conch shell trumpeted the start, and then drum beats, representing Mother Earth’s heart, pounded as Sanchez’s bare feet caressed the ground.

As coronavirus infections peaked in San Antonio, with the disease disproportionately devastating Native and Latino communities — and with nearly 150,000 Americans having already died of covid — there was no choice but to cancel the danza sessions, an ancient Aztec ritual that Indigenous peoples have kept alive for centuries.

Sanchez knew he was vulnerable. He had been through appendicitis, he was 61 and, as an essential worker — he ran a crew that cleaned hospitals on the city’s two largest military bases — staying home was not an option. He rose at 5 a.m. for the first shift and began a second shift at 5 p.m., relatives said. The long hours gave his family stability but took a toll on his health.

In July, Sanchez tested positive for the coronavirus. His wife, Yvette Mendez, who is Apache, said that as soon as he went to the hospital, “I just got a feeling in my stomach.”

Born in Mexico City, Sanchez came to California in the 1970s as a professional dancer and helped introduce danza to Mexican Americans seeking to reconnect with their roots.

Mendez saw Sanchez perform a solo at Stanford University and was mesmerized by his agility: “I just saw him and knew I wanted to have that man’s baby,” she said.

The couple soon married, had two sons and in the 1990s moved to Texas, where Sanchez started a danza group. He taught scores of Texans dance steps that emerged from ancestral philosophies about achieving balance with nature.

Sanchez loved squash blossom quesadillas, movie nights and sipping mezcal with his friends. Few of his co-workers at the military hospitals knew he held near-mythic status among Aztec dancers.

As Sanchez’s organs began to shut down, as he struggled to breathe without help from a ventilator, nurses called his family to his bedside.

“He waited for us,” Mendez said. “I almost didn’t recognize him. What this disease does is ravage. We saw a shell of the person we knew.”

Covered in protective gear, with her husband barely conscious, Mendez sang him an Apache medicine song to ease his passage to Mictlan, the Aztec underworld.

Sanchez died July 30. Donations from people he had touched through danza raised enough to pay for his traditional funeral. It was streamed live on Facebook to hundreds of viewers.

Some of Sanchez’s loved ones are angry, blaming state and national leaders for the uncontrolled spread of the virus. “I just feel like so many people died needlessly,” Mendez said. “Manolo didn’t have to die.”

'So hard'

“Hey, Mom, don’t come by me, don’t get near me,” Londell Woodbury Jr. called out to his mother when he got home from work on Sept. 17. “I think I might have covid.”

By the time Woodbury, a 23-year-old prison guard, came down with the disease, nearly 200,000 Americans had died of covid. Florida’s numbers were soaring anew, yet the governor forbade local officials from shutting businesses or mandating mask-wearing.

Florida has recorded 189 inmate deaths from covid, among the highest numbers in the country. More than 17,022 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus, along with 3,882 prison staff.

Woodbury stood in the driveway of the house in Jacksonville that he shared with his mother, Lawanna Brown, 45, and his sister Chassity, who is 11. Brown would normally greet him right there with a hug. But now her son told her not to approach. They had checked his temperature at work. He had a fever.

“Mom, so many people at work have covid,” Woodbury said.

“They told him to go outside or into another room to try to make him a little cooler, so he could go ahead and work,” Brown recalled.

A spokesman for the Florida Department of Corrections declined to comment on whether Woodbury was told to try to cool down so he could return to work at the state prison in Lake Butler, where 325 inmates and 176 staff have tested positive for the coronavirus since March.

At home, Woodbury avoided the front door, instead climbing through a window into his room. “He locked his door so I wouldn’t come in,” Brown said, “because he knew I wanted to see him so badly.”

As the months of coronavirus anxiety crawled by, Brown, a service representative for a Jacksonville health-care company, had been able to work from home. But her son had to go to work. He had just taken the corrections officer job at the state prison in May, seeing it as a steppingstone to a career as a police detective.

The family had been wary of the virus from the start, but the messages from politicians made them wonder. Chassity said she and her brother thought the whole coronavirus scare could be a hoax.

“Before my mom and my brother and everybody got covid, me and my brother, we thought it might be fake,” she said. “The president was saying it was no big deal.”

Her mother said she started out the pandemic “ordering groceries online and washing everything off before I brought it in. But we seemed to be pretty safe, and I thought covid was kind of dying down.” With Trump “saying it was like getting the flu,” Brown said, “we weren’t fearful.”

But now it was real. Brown cleared out her bedroom so her son could quarantine there. He spent the next 10 days at home, bedridden most of the time. Woodbury’s mother and sister dropped meals off outside the bedroom door. They FaceTimed him from the next room.

“My brother would not let me come in,” Chassity recalled. “I tried to sneak in once to see him, but he caught me and locked the door to keep me out.”

A couple of days after Woodbury isolated himself, Brown noticed that she was “really, really tired. I was staying up all night taking care of my son, bringing him food and drink.”

She had caught the virus. Infected, she was free to come into closer contact with her son. She fed and cared for him. He seemed to be improving, Brown said. But then, one day, she called his nickname, “Tigger, Tigger,” and there was no response.

An ambulance took Woodbury to the hospital, where he died three days later, on Oct. 2.

At the funeral, Brown insisted everyone wear masks and undergo temperature checks.

“I had a young, healthy, 23-year-old son, and he’s gone,” said Brown, who has recovered.

After her brother died, Chassity fell off the honor roll at her arts magnet school and dropped out of the Jacksonville Children’s Chorus, where she had been singing for years.

“Things have changed a lot,” she said. “I missed two months of school, and I have to have tutoring now. Normally, I get A’s and B’s, but now I’m getting C’s. I also got a D, and I broke down. It’s been so hard.”

'Mind-blowing'

In Mitchell, S.D., for much of the year, the coronavirus was something that happened elsewhere.

A rural community of 15,600 about an hour from Sioux Falls, Mitchell was where one of the state’s earliest covid deaths took place, back in March, when a traveler passing through succumbed. But for the next several months, the coronavirus just wasn’t a fact of local life.

Then, late in the fall, the virus hit hard. The death toll in Davison County, where Mitchell is located, rose from two deaths at the start of October to 41 by the end of November.

Mike Denne, 69, a garrulous locksmith in Mitchell, was no activist, not a vocal anti-masker by any means. He just didn’t wear one.

“He didn’t care for it,” said Cody Denne, his 36-year-old son, who worked with his father at the family’s store, Ron’s Bicycle and Locksmith Shop. Father ran the lock business, son handled the bicycles. “He just didn’t want to wear one. It was old-style, old-man stubbornness.”

Cody’s wife, Kourtney, chalked it up to her father-in-law’s life experience. “He’s that generation,” she said. Mike had survived a heart attack and a bad car wreck, so “covid was just like something he could get through. That was his mentality.”

Mike’s attitude was common.

“We’re in the Midwest and people don’t like to be told what to do,” said Kourtney, a 28-year-old accountant. “Until people go through such a sudden loss, they don’t understand the severity of it.”

The state’s governor, Kristi L. Noem (R), has rejected virus restrictions, refusing to mandate mask-wearing and promising to defy the Biden administration if the new president requires face covering. Over the summer, Noem welcomed visitors to huge, mostly unmasked events like the July fireworks display at Mount Rushmore, where Trump spoke, and the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August, a superspreader event that infected more than 330 people.

In mid-October, Denne fell ill. Admitted to the hospital two days later, he was put on a ventilator and had to be airlifted to a bigger facility in Sioux Falls, where he died on Nov. 6.

His family’s last contact with him came via FaceTime on Oct. 24. The descent was, Kourtney said, “a mind-blowing three weeks.”

Cases in the Dakotas have piled up at the nation’s highest per capita rates this fall. In Mitchell, the mounting misery changed some minds, but not many. The school system mandated masks for students and staff, making in-person classes possible. But when the town council voted last month to impose a mask requirement, opponents raised a stink and the council scrapped most of the penalties for violators.

Denne — who left behind his wife of nearly five decades, Gail, along with four children, nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren — was still conscious at the hospital when his son texted him about a lock job. Denne didn’t reply. Later, on what would be their final FaceTime call, Cody asked why he hadn’t responded.

His father said: “You gotta learn on your own.”

In the early 1960s, a young minor league baseball pitcher and aspiring country singer named Charley Pride had settled into a discouraging routine. His days were spent toiling in Helena, Mont., at a smelter operated by the Anaconda Copper Mining Co., and he spent his free time playing for its semipro baseball team, the East Helena Smelterites.

He stood out as an African American working in a musical genre that seldom welcomed Black voices. But he developed a small but enthusiastic fan base singing in Montana honky tonks, which in 1962 led to his invitation to perform before a show headlined by country singers Red Sovine and Red Foley.

After Mr. Pride sang “Heartaches By the Numbers” and “Lovesick Blues,” Sovine, a veteran performer, was struck by Mr. Pride’s magnetism and the enthusiastic response he evoked from the White audience. He suggested that Mr. Pride take his chances in Nashville.

It took him nearly two years to get a contract. Record executives loved his demo tapes but got cold feet after viewing his picture. In one audition, he was told, “Now sing in your regular voice.” A talent scout even suggested that Mr. Pride sell himself as a novelty by dressing in Colonial garb and adopting the stage name of George Washington Carver III. Finally, country guitarist Chet Atkins, who was also an RCA Records executive, saw promise in the singer.

Radio stations received his first singles, credited to Country Charley Pride, without publicity photos — a cautious move by Atkins. Disc jockeys latched onto the records, and country fans listened. “It was RCA’s decision not to play up or down the color thing, but to just let the voice go, put the record out and let the people decide,” Mr. Pride later told The Washington Post.

Mr. Pride, who grew up in the Mississippi cotton fields and became the first major African American singing star in country music, died Dec. 12 at 86 in Dallas. The cause was complications from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to a statement from the Nashville public relations firm 2911 Media.

Harmonica player DeFord Bailey, who was Black, had been one of the earliest and most popular cast members of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s. A generation later, soul stars Ray Charles and Solomon Burke recorded country songs. But Mr. Pride shattered a show-business barrier, paving the way for subsequent Black entertainers — Stoney Edwards, Big Al Downing and Darius Rucker, among them — who followed Mr. Pride’s lead in Nashville.

Country-music historian Rich Kienzle said Mr. Pride embraced a traditional sound: recording with fiddles and steel guitar in an era when many country singers were trying to sound like Las Vegas entertainers. Onstage, he also liked to defuse tension with self-deprecating, sometimes self-demeaning humor.

“He would make jokes to audiences about having a ‘permanent tan,’ ” Kienzle said. “The music won out over any bigotry.”

With more than 50 Top 10 hits on the Billboard country charts between 1966 and 1984, Mr. Pride was one of the genre’s most popular and durable performers. He sang of hoboing and hitchhiking on “The Atlantic Coastal Line” (1966) and “Is Anybody Goin’ to San Antone” (1970), adultery on “The Snakes Crawl at Night” (1966) and heartbreak on “Just Between You and Me” (1966) — and brought a pained believability to each.

The biographical song “Mississippi Cotton Picking Delta Town” (1974), written for Mr. Pride by Harold Dorman and George Wiley Gann, evoked his hardscrabble youth — “I’ve picked cotton till my fingers hurt/ Draggin’ a sack through the delta dirt” — and the restlessness that compelled him to leave: “One dusty street to walk up and down/ Nothing much to do but hang around/ In a Mississippi cotton pickin’ delta town.”

Mr. Pride’s greatest success was a paean to romantic contentment, “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin’ ” (1971), a song written by Ben Peters, which appeared on the pop charts for four months. In the 1971 film adaptation of Ken Kesey’s novel “Sometimes a Great Notion,” Mr. Pride sang “All His Children,” a quasi-country gospel song co-written by Henry Mancini.

He often turned down songs that he believed were too controversial. One such song, “Blackjack County Chain,” by songwriter Red Lane, recounted a chain gang beating a sadistic sheriff to death. After Mr. Pride rejected it, his frequent touring mate, Willie Nelson, later recorded it.

Mr. Pride often endured cruel jokes and taunts from fellow entertainers. George Jones once drunkenly painted “KKK” on Mr. Pride’s car. (Mr. Pride had passed out at a party while trying to match Jones, an alcoholic, drink for drink.)

Early in his recording career, Mr. Pride’s manager, Jack Johnson, set up a private jam session with singer Faron Young, co-owner of a widely read trade journal Music City News. Young, known for badgering colleagues with profanity and provocative insults, praised Mr. Pride’s singing but referred to him with a racial epithet.

“In all honesty, it took longer for the Nashville crowd to become accustomed to me than I thought it would,” Mr. Pride recalled in his 1994 memoir, “Pride,” written with Jim Henderson. “I was a novelty, but I never allowed myself to feel out of place. Unless someone else brought it up — that I was different — I tried not to think about it much.”

Charley Frank Pride was born in Sledge, Miss., on March 18, 1934, and was the fourth of 11 children in a family of sharecroppers. His father named him Charl but, because of a clerical error, the “ey” was added to his birth certificate.

“We lived in what we called a ‘shotgun house’ and there was a bed over on this side and a bed over on this side, and we’d sleep three and four to a bed,” Mr. Pride told Dan Rather on AXS-TV’s “The Big Interview” in 2015. “I remember sometimes I’d wake up, and my brother’s toes were right in my nose.”

Mr. Pride’s fascination with country music began early during his childhood in the Mississippi Delta. Though the region is best known for its blues, his strict and religious father regarded the genre as the devil’s music. Instead, Mr. Pride recalled listening to the Grand Ole Opry and a local country station on the family’s battery-run Philco radio.

“My dad was in charge of the dials on the radio, so that’s what we listened to,” Mr. Pride once said. “In my formative years, country music was what I heard. I got to be 10 or 11 years old before I started listening to other music. By the time I experienced the blues, I was in my teens.”

Mr. Pride bought his first guitar at 14, but baseball competed with music as a consuming passion.

“As far as I was concerned, my future was in baseball,” he wrote in his memoir. “I saw what Jackie Robinson did, that was my goal. Before he reached the major leagues, there were no real role models for kids like us.”

Throughout the 1950s, Mr. Pride pitched for Negro leagues teams, minor league affiliates of major league teams and occasionally in exhibition games against barnstorming major league players. At one point while he was playing in the Negro leagues, he and a teammate were traded for a used team bus.

The Army drafted Mr. Pride in 1958. After his discharge two years later, he joined Anaconda.

In his memoir, Mr. Pride spoke of struggles with manic depression. He also invested in many failed business ventures. However, his music management company prospered by discovering new talents Ronnie Milsap and Gary Stewart, and bringing both to RCA Records. In 2010, he became a minority owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.

Mr. Pride was voted entertainer of the year by the Country Music Association in 1971. He received a Grammy for his 1971 album, “Charley Pride Sings Heart Songs.” He won additional Grammys at the 1971 ceremony for two gospel songs, “Did You Think to Pray” and “Let Me Live.”

In 1956, he married Rozene Cohran. In addition to his wife, survivors include three children, reggae musician Carlton Pride; Dion Pride, a country singer; and Angela Pride; four siblings; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

Mr. Pride credited his early experiences with giving him an unflinching determination to succeed.

“When I used to go to school and pledge allegiance to the flag, all those nice words about ‘liberty and justice for all,’ I just had to look out my window: We had to play basketball outside while the whites had a gym,” he told The Post in 1984. “But my mother told me to hang in there, that someday it would be different, and that kept me believing.”

CVD HNTR. That is the license plate on Joseph Varon’s Mercedes 550. A vanity plate can be construed as grandiosity — but in this case, it is quite literal. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Varon, a 58-year-old physician and chief of staff at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston, has been hunting covid-19 for 268 days straight. He has not had a single day off since March.

There can be no vacation when a pandemic is tearing through the country, your covid-19 unit is filled with more than 45 patients and your staff is exhausted.

Varon’s passion for medicine has fueled his determination “to nail this thing to the ground.”

“I was meant to do this,” he told The Washington Post.

Varon is both a medical maverick and a kind spirit. Despite his media appearances in which he predicted this winter will be “the darkest days in modern American medical history,” he has maintained a cheerful disposition and a deep sense of purpose.

Varon’s tireless devotion was perhaps best illustrated by Go Nakamura, who photographed the PPE-clad doctor embracing an elderly patient whom Varon had found crying and asking to see his wife.

The image gained national attention after it was widely shared on social media.

As they watched their patients quickly deteriorate in the spring, Varon and four other critical care physicians and scientists joined efforts in researching and developing protocols for the prevention and treatment of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

“This is a war-type situation where you don’t wait for the next bomb to drop on you, but rather you grab whatever you have available and fight back,” he said.” You don’t sit around and wait for the cure to fall from the sky.”

In hopes of avoiding patient intubation, they landed on a combination of treatments that they say significantly improves outcomes, including steroids, anticoagulants and ascorbic acid. Varon claims the treatment cocktail has kept the death rate of patients at UMCC about 6 percent over the course of the pandemic. The mortality rate in New York reached 25 percent in March, and has come down to 7.6 in August, according to a study of New York hospitals published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine.

Born and raised in Mexico City, and with specialties in pneumonology, intensive care, internal medicine and geriatrics, Varon was particularly well-equipped to wage war against a virus that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.

His extensive credentials include a residency in internal medicine at Stanford University. He is the recipient of multiple awards, the latest a proclamation of “Dr. Joseph Varon Day” in Houston for his “his essential and outstanding work” on covid-19.

But his personal experiences, he said, also prepared him for this moment.

In 1985, he was working as an intern in one of Mexico City’s largest hospitals when an 8.1-magnitude earthquake leveled the building. He watched many of his colleagues die that day.

“I have seen disaster up front all of my life,” he said. “The only thing that scares me is corona” — a disease he calls “short-term AIDS” — and its unpredictability.

Mid-interview, Varon had to duck out. He followed up with a text:

“I just admitted 6 covid patients in the past 60 minutes,” he wrote. “It is absolute madness.”

As if the pandemic itself wasn’t enough of a challenge, some health-care workers have been grappling with a parallel phenomenon: disbelief in, or outright denial of, the coronavirus’s existence — even among some patients who are already infected with it.

Varon believes a widespread disregard to social distancing, use of masks and the politicizing of the disease are some of main reasons the country is experiencing such a dramatic surge of cases and hospitalizations.

Texas is no exception. With more than 1.3 million confirmed cases and over 23,000 covid-19 deaths, cities such as El Paso are seeing their hospitals overwhelmed and their medical staff overworked. Just a few weeks ago, Texas National Guard troops were deployed to El Paso to help with morgue operations as the city saw a spike in hospitalizations and deaths.

Houston has also seen a steady increase of hospitalizations in the past month, raising alarms among experts. At the end of September, the UMCC covid-19 unit had three patients. It now has more than 45, Varon said.

The warnings about social distancing and wearing masks however, are falling on deaf ears, he says.

“It’s as if you watched people doing drugs, and you keep telling them to stop because it will kill them, and they keep doing in it in front of you,” he said. “It hurts.”

Over the months, Varon said he has treated dozens of covid-19 patients who, no matter how ill they are, refuse to acknowledge the virus is real.

Varon recalled a man in his 60s who worked as a security guard at the hospital and was an outspoken denier of the virus. He seized every opportunity to assert that the pandemic was a government hoax and almost never wore a mask.

The man eventually got infected and was hospitalized, Varon said.

As he gasped for air, the patient demanded Varon show him the document that proved he had covid-19. After showing him the test result, the man insisted it was false.

“It must be a false document, and what I have is pneumonia it’s not covid, it’s my asthma,” Varon recalled him saying.

The patient died within days.

As the imminent approval of the vaccine raises great hope for the fight against covid, Varon worries it will make people let their guards down.

“People are tired, they have fatigue syndrome and I am afraid they are going to think the vaccine is the answer when the answer is that we all do our job and part in controlling this pandemic,” he said.

But Varon’s pace has not slowed, despite pleas from his family and friends for him to take some time off.

“You are not superman,” Sara Varon, his wife of 34 years, told him one recent morning.

“Well these days, I have to be,” he replied.

But the secret to his remarkable endurance might reside in his humor.

As the medical staff at UMCC witnessed the psychological effects of isolation in patients, Varon instructed staff to wear large photographs of their faces hung around their necks, so that patients could recognize the person who was caring for them behind those “space suits.”

One day, he went in to see patients with a picture of Brad Pitt attached to his personal protective equipment suit, eliciting laughter from even those who were the sickest.

“Other doctors stay behind the lines, they do not get their hands dirty,” said Tanna Ingraham, an ICU nurse at UMCC hospital, who was also hospitalized with covid-19 for 12 days. “He is totally hands-on and treats every single one of his patients as if they were his family members.”

Varon made headlines in 2005 when he took an unorthodox approach to a drowning victim: He purposefully lowered the patient’s body temperature to 90 degrees and kept him cold for three days, an unusually long time for therapeutic hypothermia.

As the patient had virtually no chances of survival when he arrived at the hospital, Varon admits it was a long shot. But the patient fully recovered.

St. Luke’s Hospital in Houston, where Varon was practicing at the time, put him under review for using the treatment on several patients, he said, and concluded that he deviated from their standard of care.

“Most doctors are rigid, they do things one way and are very resistant to change, their default thinking is ‘It is not going to work,’"" said Stephen Barnes, an attorney and board certified surgeon, who is also a close friend of Varon. “He always keeps an open mind.”

Varon is keeping an open mind about the coronavirus, too, urging health officials to review the prophylactic potential of Ivermectin, a drug commonly used to treat parasitic worms. A vaccine will take months before it becomes widely available to the public, and he believes the drug could save lives in the meantime.

It’s not approved for coronavirus and the National Institutes of Health recommends against it, except in clinical trials. But Varon wants to throw everything we have at this pandemic — an example of his stubborn work ethic.

“His dream come true will be the day he beats the virus back down with a combination of vaccine and medicine that you give people early before they get sick,” Barnes said. “Like a deer hunter, he wants to kill it and put it over his fireplace.”

I have spent eight months watching my fellow prisoners inside a state penitentiary in Washington suffer from covid-19. Now there is finally a vaccine on the horizon. Unfortunately, it may not get to many incarcerated people in time to save us. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Those responsible for deciding the order in which people get the vaccine (chiefly members of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel and state officials) say their goal is to prioritize front-line health-care workers and people especially likely to contract the virus and experience the worst outcomes, including nursing home residents. The close quarters where prisoners live make us an extremely high-risk population, too, and the prison population is aging. But because of social stigma, we’ve become an afterthought in many states (although a very few, including Massachusetts, Nebraska and North Carolina, have placed us ahead of the healthy general population). The Federal Bureau of Prisons will get an early allotment of the vaccine, but the agency plans to give it to staff, not incarcerated people.

Prisoners lose their liberty — I am serving time for robbery and a murder I committed in my early 20s, something I regret every day and know I cannot change — but we have not been sentenced to suffer or die from a virus. If the standard for vaccine distribution involves helping the most vulnerable, as officials insist, then we ought to be near the top of the list.

Advertisement

A recent study found that prisoners were nearly four times as likely than the average citizen to get the coronavirus and — adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity — twice as likely to die from it. (The discrepancy was even higher earlier in the pandemic, narrowing only as the virus spread aggressively in the general population.) One of the largest coronavirus clusters of any kind occurred at Avenal State Prison, in California’s San Joaquin Valley, with more than 2,800 infected incarcerated people. Nationally, there have been nearly 230,000 covid cases in prisons, and more than 1,500 people have died, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit criminal justice news outlet.

Recognizing that the virus can rip through crowded prisons, officials have taken modest steps to shrink prison populations and reduce density: In April, in my state, Gov. Jay Inslee (D) ordered prisoners who had not committed violent crimes, and who were nearing the end of their sentences, to be released. Other governors have issued similar edicts, and several states have reduced jail populations by cutting or eliminating bail, among other measures. But many prisons were wildly overcrowded to begin with: Nebraska's were at 150 percent capacity in July, when the state accelerated its parole program.

Everything about prison life makes social distancing difficult, and protections are paltry. Masks are required, but the last time my unit received any was Sept. 1. We’ve each gotten six masks during the entire pandemic. And while all prisoners are required to wear our ragged masks or risk getting an infraction, guards often wear theirs improperly. Our temperatures are taken twice daily, but that is an ineffectual measure against asymptomatic spread.

Advertisement

This past week, my unit entered its third quarantine since March, because two prisoners tested positive — meaning classes and other activities are canceled. Still, to retrieve meals from the chow hall — which is closed for in-person eating — I must walk shoulder to shoulder with 20 to 50 other men up and down two stairwells that are about five feet across. For a half-hour a day, I am let out of my cell with 20 other prisoners to make a phone call. If I’m not lucky enough to be among the first in line for the 10 phones, I stand and wait with the others in front of open-barred occupied cells. And when I do get to a phone, I put my face next to a receiver someone else has just used, with no cleaning between calls. (I’ve seen people take one of their socks off and put it over the receiver.) Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is banned in the prison, except for use by guards, as if the chance that someone might drink it for a buzz is a bigger risk than contracting the virus. (Contacted by a Post editor, Susan Biller, interim communications director for the Washington State Department of Corrections, disputed several of these assertions: She said that masks are available to prisoners on request; that guards can be disciplined if they fail to wear masks properly; that “cleaning and sanitation protocols” are in place for phones and that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is offered to inmates “when soap and water is not readily available.”)

We are sitting ducks, yet there’s a strong bias against protecting us. After Colorado’s health department put prisoners in the second of three tiers of vaccination priority — behind the highest-risk non-prisoners but ahead of free citizens with moderate or low risk — Democratic Gov. Jared Polis blasted the idea: “There’s no way it’s going to go to prisoners before it goes to people who haven’t committed any crime,” he said of the vaccine.

But leaving prisoners vulnerable also endangers the communities surrounding our facilities. Guards, medical staff and administrators who work in the prisons live in the surrounding towns; they can transport the virus in both directions.

Advertisement

Even if guards are prioritized to receive the vaccine, this should not comfort the communities near prisons. It’s not yet clear whether vaccines will prevent people who have been infected from spreading the virus. What’s more, I have heard a few guards (some of them vocal supporters of President Trump) say they wouldn’t take a vaccine if it were offered. They say they don’t trust the approval process, which they think was rushed, or Washington state’s Democrat-led government. More than one has told me that covid-19 is no worse than the common flu.

Regardless, prisoners should be vaccinated not just to protect nearby communities but for our own sake. The number of people behind bars in the United States is staggering, amounting to more than 1 percent of all working-age adults. With 5 percent of the world’s population, we have 20 percent of the prisoners. People of color are especially susceptible to covid-19, and they are disproportionately represented behind bars: 38.6 percent of the prison population is Black, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, compared with 13 percent of the general population. Young people tend to fare better with the virus than older Americans, but nearly 20 percent of all prisoners are older than 50, a result of decades of “tough on crime” legislation.

Just last month, a 62-year-old friend of mine, Michael Cornethan — we called him “Cornbread” — died a painful but very preventable death. He was a father, a leader within the prison community, a proud Black man and a confidante to many. I met him in the correctional facility where I am housed, but he was transferred to a different penitentiary two years ago and became the third incarcerated person in the Washington state system to die of covid.

Lives like Cornethan’s should not be seen as disposable. The United States could be a leader in the protocols for the distribution of the vaccine, showing the world that, despite our punitive policies, we can treat even prisoners equitably. After all, those of us behind bars may be segregated from the rest of America, but — without diminishing our crimes — we remain part of society. We are very vulnerable citizens.

Within days, the United States will probably begin administering vaccines aimed at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus that emerged last year. It will ramp up slowly, with states determining who receives immunization in what order. The goal is that the country eventually have a large enough population of individuals immune to the virus that it can’t spread easily, a goal that will take months to achieve.

In the meantime, how many more Americans will die?

We are experiencing more deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, than at any prior point in the pandemic. Both because of a failure at the individual level to take necessary precautions against the virus’s spread and because of a tacit embrace of inaction at the federal and, in some cases, state level, the virus has spread largely out of control for the past three months.

Advertisement

President Trump is one of those who has suggested that efforts to contain the virus are not warranted. Earlier this week, he spoke approvingly of the rate of spread, given that it, too, confers immunity. Of course, that comes at the cost of a significant number of human lives.

On Friday morning, he tied together his two current fixations — the imminent vaccine and his efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election — in a two-tweet package.

“The Swine Flu (H1N1), and the attempt for a vaccine by the Obama Administration, with Joe Biden in charge, was a complete and total disaster,” he claimed, reiterating an assertion that he’s made before. “Now they want to come in and take over one of the ‘greatest and fastest medical miracles in modern day history.’ I don’t think so!”

“I just want to stop the world from killing itself!” he added.

Advertisement

Yet because the virus has spread so widely, the number of new deaths recorded each day at this point exceeds the number of Americans killed in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield suggested that that daily death toll would continue for the immediate future.

“We are in the time frame now that probably for the next 60 to 90 days, we’re going to have more deaths per day than we had at 9/11 or we had at Pearl Harbor,” Redfield said.

Again, the reason why is that the number of coronavirus infections hasn’t been contained.

While defenders of the status quo like to argue that the number of deaths is incidental compared to the number of new infections, the two are obviously linked. As cases increase, so do deaths, though on a delay. The current surge in new cases began Sept. 12; the number of new deaths recorded each day began increasing about a month later.

(You’ll notice the late-November drops on both numbers. That’s probably a function of scaled-back reporting during the Thanksgiving holiday.)

It’s easy to retroactively identify the link between the number of new deaths and new cases, incorporating that lag. But for the past few months, there’s been a steady relationship: About 1.8 percent of new coronavirus infections have led to deaths a few weeks down the line. The period between the two has shifted a bit, but at this point, a 26-day lag offers the closest correlation to the average number of new deaths the country is seeing.

This is a seven-day average of new deaths, so while the country has seen recorded deaths top 3,000 for the past two days, the average hasn’t yet caught up.

Advertisement

But it probably will over the short term, based on the aforementioned ratio. If it holds over the next 26 days, the country would see more than 3,500 deaths per day by Jan. 1, 2021.

An estimate from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has a less bleak projection, figuring that the average number of deaths each day will probably remain under 3,200 even in a worse-case scenario. That projection, though, is already tracking well behind what the country is seeing.

Even if the rate of new infections begins slowing immediately, the existing ratio of new cases to new deaths means that some 360,000 Americans will have lost their lives by the new year. The IHME projection puts the total number of new deaths by the end of January at about 400,000, give or take about 30,000.

The important factor here is that so much of what’s coming is already baked in. Combine that with the fact that the vaccine will be deployed relatively slowly, and the short-term picture is bleak.

Advertisement

“The reality is the vaccine approval this week’s not going to really impact that I think to any degree for the next 60 days,” Redfield said Thursday.

The best we can do for the next two months is to try to limit the number of new infections and thereby limit the number of new covid-19 deaths. There’s no point in allowing the virus to spread without control, given that a vaccine (several vaccines!) are on the horizon, which can generate herd immunity without the same death toll.

It would probably be useful for the president to embrace this message instead of one so heavily focused on assuming credit for the eventual vaccine.

New Hampshire Republican state Rep. Dick Hinch wept as he accepted a nomination as speaker of the house at an outdoor swearing-in ceremony with hundreds of his peers, including dozens without masks. “It is my honor to accept,” he said on Dec. 2 at the University of New Hampshire, his voice trembling as he tried to choke back tears. “I am humbled by your support.”

One week later, Hinch, 71, was found dead in his home. The state’s chief medical examiner found Hinch’s cause of death was covid-19, New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald (R) announced Thursday.

Hinch’s death has left Democratic legislators demanding tests for representatives and their staff who attended last week’s ceremony, and some Republicans castigating their colleagues for not following basic public health guidelines.

At a news conference Thursday, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) lauded Hinch as a “tireless leader” and described him as a close friend, calling his death a “cautionary tale” about the costs of failing to wear a mask. Sununu lashed out at other Republican legislators for flouting masks at large gatherings.

“For those who are just out there doing the opposite just to make some ridiculous political point, it is horribly wrong,” Sununu said. “Please use your heads. Don’t act like a bunch of children, frankly.”

Other state Republicans were even harsher in their condemnation of their colleagues who had opposed health guidelines.

“Those in our caucus who refused to take precautions are responsible for Dick Hinch’s death,” state Rep. William Marsh (R), a retired doctor, wrote on Twitter.

Hinch’s death comes as New Hampshire grapples with its worst surge since the beginning of the pandemic. In the past week, daily reported cases rose 22 percent and deaths grew 20 percent, according to The Washington Post’s coronavirus tracker. Covid-related hospitalizations also increased by 59 percent.

In the weeks leading up to his death, Hinch was at the center of a tense controversy between Republican and Democratic state legislators about a lack of adherence to public health guidelines by the GOP members.

On Nov. 9, Hinch and about 50 New Hampshire GOP representatives were photographed at an indoor gathering to celebrate the election results, in which they gained the majority in the state House. None of them were wearing masks, according to the Concord Monitor.

The Republican lawmakers gathered again Nov. 20 for an indoor caucus meeting at McIntyre Ski Area. That same day, the governor passed an executive order mandating masks. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services later determined that at least four state lawmakers contracted the virus at the event.

Sununu condemned the meeting, which had an open buffet and where lawmakers disregarded social distancing guidelines and opted out of wearing masks, calling it “poorly managed.”

The outbreak outraged Democratic members of the state legislature, who were furious that Hinch did not promptly inform them.

“This decision puts the lives of all members and staff of the House of Representatives at risk,” said outgoing House Speaker Steve Shurtleff (D) a day before the swearing-in ceremony, known as Organization Day.

Only 270 representatives from the 400-member House attended the outdoor event Dec. 2, with most Democrats opting for an alternate virtual swearing-in on Dec. 3 to avoid possible exposure to the virus. Hinch sectioned off an area of the event for about 80 Republican lawmakers who refused to wear masks, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader.

At the time, Hinch dismissed concerns over the outbreak tied to the ski resort meeting, contending that the infections were inevitable given that most of the legislators are older and retired.

“We are experiencing higher than usual rates of infections in our state, and the Legislature and its members are not immune from that,” Hinch said in a statement Dec. 1, according to the Monitor. “We are a citizen legislature, and it can be expected that our legislators are at the same risk as the citizens we represent.”

The New Hampshire HHS announced Thursday that it is investigating how Hinch contracted the virus, the Union Leader reported. Lori Shibinette, the HHS commissioner, would not say when or if Hinch was tested for the coronavirus before his death. She also wouldn’t comment on whether he knew he had covid-19 at Organization Day.

In a letter to the governor on Thursday, the Democratic minority leaders of the New Hampshire Senate and House criticized Republicans for potentially exposing staffers and colleagues at the swearing-in ceremony.

“No one, in any job, should have to fear for their health at work,” the letter said. “The legislature and the entire state government cannot function without dedicated state employees and it is our duty to protect them and all legislators from undue harm.”

A cruise ship that set sail from Singapore on Monday was forced to return a day early when an 83-year-old passenger tested positive for coronavirus. Except that now it turns out he didn’t have a coronavirus infection after all, officials said Thursday. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Royal Caribbean’s Quantum of the Seas returned to port on Wednesday and allowed passengers to disembark late that evening after being quarantined in their rooms for most of the day. The 83-year-old man who sparked coronavirus fears on the ship had complained of a stomach illness, and his first test came back positive.

Three follow-up tests, however, “confirmed that the 83-year-old male Singaporean on board Royal Caribbean International’s Quantum of the Seas does not have COVID-19 infection,” the Singapore Ministry of Health said in a statement Thursday. One of those was a retest of the original sample, the ministry said, adding that it would “support the laboratory on board the Quantum of the Seas in its review of its testing processes.”

Cruise ships suffered crippling outbreaks early in the pandemic, forcing passengers to quarantine in their staterooms and trapping crews on board for weeks at a time. Some companies have tried to confirm that passengers are virus-free before embarking, though travelers have still tested positive despite the precautions.

Singapore instituted its “cruise to nowhere” pilot program to stimulate the tourism economy and provide an outlet for residents who want to travel amid the pandemic. There were 1,680 passengers and 1,148 crew on the cruise ship, which aimed to provide an “Ocean Getaway” and intended to return to the port it launched from with no other stops after four days.

The Ministry of Health rescinded quarantine orders for the passengers who had close contact with the man.

In a statement, Singapore Tourism Board chief executive Keith Tan said the ordeal had “given us valuable learnings” and reinforced that the response to any onboard cases would be “swift and effective.” He commended Royal Caribbean International, the terminal operator and Genting Cruise Lines, which adjusted its own schedule in response to the incident.

“Their professionalism gives us confidence that our pilot cruises will continue to be safe and sustainable, as we work with our partners and cruise lines to chart a new course for safe cruising,” Tan said.

Coronavirus deaths in D.C., Maryland and Virginia surpassed 10,000 on Thursday, a somber marker of the region’s failure to contain the crisis. The District reported four new deaths, for a total of 708. Virginia reported 54 deaths, for a total of 4,335. Maryland reported 50 deaths, bringing its total fatalities to 5,012.

For weeks, health officials warned that a record surge in infections would be followed by rising hospitalizations and deaths. Their fears materialized in late November, as rampant community spread and Thanksgiving travel gave way to a return of the virus to the region’s nursing homes and a steady rise in fatalities not seen since the spring.

The seven-day average in daily reported deaths exceeded 60 this week — the highest since June. Given that new daily infections have continued pushing higher, and that deaths tend to lag cases by two weeks, the increase in fatalities is likely to continue.

As of Thursday, about 340 of every 10,000 people in the region had tested positive for the coronavirus — and seven of every 10,000 had lost their lives.

There had been 103 deaths for every 100,000 people in the District, 83 deaths per 100,000 residents of Maryland and 51 deaths per 100,000 residents of Virginia, according to a Washington Post database. That compares with a high of 198 deaths per 100,000 people in New York state, and a low of 14 deaths per 100,000 in Vermont.

Those who died in Maryland, Virginia and the District were activists, writers, firefighters and pastors. They worked in our grocery stores, drove our public buses and taught our children. Horace and Violet Saunders, both 96, died days apart after a 75-year love story. Lawrence Nokes, 69, of Carroll County, Md., died a week after finding out that his wife — “his light,” his children said — had also been fatally stricken by the virus that he likely brought home from his job at a nursing home.

The early assumption that the virus would devastate only the elderly and the infirm has unraveled over eight months. Wogene Debele, 43, died before she could see her newborn son; Terrance Burke, a 54-year-old high school basketball coach who worked out regularly, was among the first public school employees to lose his life. One-tenth of the victims in Virginia have been younger than 60. In Maryland, 31 individuals under the age of 30 have lost their lives — including a 1-year-old boy, whose death was announced last week.

Black and Latino communities have been disproportionately hit, though these disparities have narrowed over time as the virus spread to rural, predominantly White areas in Maryland and Virginia. Across all three regions, about 35 percent of fatalities have been African Americans, who account for just a quarter of the population.

Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities also continue to serve as hot spots for covid-19 deaths. The District’s 19 long-term care facilities are linked to 25 percent of the city’s more than 700 fatalities; in Maryland, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and group homes represent 2,400 deaths — nearly half the state’s total toll.

After thousands of deaths in April and May, the region’s stringent restrictions on social activity allowed the number of monthly covid-19 fatalities to plummet, dipping to 690 in August. The District went from reporting a dozen new fatalities daily to less than three; in October, there was a stretch of eight blissful days in which the city reported no new deaths.

But that period has ended. In just the first week of December, about 500 residents of D.C., Maryland and Virginia lost their lives to covid-19. If these daily numbers persist — and experts say they’re actually likely to increase — December is poised to overtake May as the region’s deadliest month on record.

What follows are profiles of three individuals who died of covid-19 in recent months, along with a link to a full collection of stories about dozens of other victims.

As the first African American to receive a full athletic scholarship to the University of Georgia, he battled racism in the Deep South and set a path that dozens of young athletes have followed.

“Every step that I took or every decision that I made, I talked to him,” said his son, Ronnie Hogue Jr. of Atlanta. “He was a really humble guy but was known wherever he went.”

Elsi Campos, cleaning crew supervisor at Pew Charitable Trust

The glass stairwell in the stately Pew Charitable Trusts office building was always spotless. As the project manager in charge of the cleaning crew for the building, Elsi Mabelicia Campos made sure of it, staying in the building until 1 or 2 a.m. to check for the tiniest of smudges with a flashlight.

It was through this dedication and attention to detail that Campos worked her way from cleaning hotel rooms as an immigrant from El Salvador in the 1970s to supervising teams of custodians for one of the largest cleaning companies in the D.C. area. It was what allowed her to help her relatives flee civil war in her home country, to raise two children as a single mother, to care for her elderly parents and to build a life for her six grandchildren.

A native Washingtonian, he joined the Masons when he was 21 and, his friends said, devoted himself to the group’s stated mission of promoting “a way of life that binds like-minded men in a worldwide brotherhood that transcends all religious, ethnic, cultural, social and educational differences.”

He never had a biological child, never held a baby of his own in his arms, and this troubled him as he grew older.

At the end of the nation’s deadliest day so far during the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump on Wednesday night emerged at an indoor Hanukkah party to speak with a crowd mostly wearing masks but not adhering to social distancing in the East Room of the White House. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Then, the president falsely said again that he won the election, boasting that victory was on the horizon in the form of long-shot legal efforts that have been repeatedly defeated in multiple states.

“All I ask for is people with wisdom and with courage, that’s all,” Trump told the crowd, according to a video of the event shared by Jewish Insider’s Jacob Kornbluh. “Because if certain very important people, if they have wisdom and if they have courage, we’re going to win this election in a landslide.”

The crowd responded by breaking into a chant of, “Four more years!”

The moment highlighted a consistent theme of Trump’s actions in the past month, as he has declined to address a dramatically worsening pandemic while focusing instead on his thus-far failed efforts to overturn the election results.

Wednesday’s White House holiday party came on the same day that 3,140 people died of covid-19 in the United States, a single-day record for deaths, according to a Washington Post analysis. Nationwide, 106,000 people were hospitalized with covid, another record.

Since Nov. 4, President Trump has repeatedly claimed his election loss as a result of massive fraud. The following is a roundup of his claims. (Video: The Washington Post)

The Hanukkah party was among at least 25 indoor parties planned in a packed holiday season at the White House, which ignored warnings from the Trump administration’s own public health experts to avoid large groups and limit travel.

More than 100 guests attended each of the two Hanukkah parties held Wednesday, according to the Times of Israel. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who recovered from the coronavirus last month, was shown not wearing a mask and shaking hands in multiple photos taken with maskless partygoers.

White House officials said they were taking safety precautions for the events, but would still allow more than 50 guests at each of the parties, reported The Post’s Josh Dawsey and Yasmeen Abutaleb. Other administration gatherings included a State Department party at the presidential guesthouse featuring roughly 200 guests earlier this week.

Trump defended the White House holding holiday parties during a pandemic this week, saying many of the guests have worn masks “and I think that’s a good thing.”

A request for comment to the first lady’s office, which has overseen the party planning, was not immediately returned late Wednesday.

Speaking in an East Room filled with lights and Christmas trees, Trump wished the crowd a happy Hanukkah before using the celebration of the eight nights to talk about the alleged strength of his campaign’s legal efforts, which have been soundly defeated in multiple states.

Courts and election bodies have repeatedly ruled the president’s campaign has not presented evidence supporting its baseless claims of fraud and wrongdoing. Trump’s allies were dealt a significant blow this week when the U.S. Supreme Court denied a last-minute attempt to overturn the results in Pennsylvania.

But Trump remained upbeat at the party, citing Wednesday’s news that Republican attorneys general in 17 states threw their support behind a lawsuit from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) seeking to invalidate votes in key swing states the president lost to President-elect Joe Biden. That suit has been dismissed as a “disaster” by some experts and officials for pushing disproved allegations.

A maskless Trump on Wednesday also falsely told partygoers that he won this year’s election against Biden “in a much easier way” than he did in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. While he earned more than 74 million votes last month, an increase of more than 11 million compared with his 2016 victory, Trump was bested by Biden’s 81 million votes, the most ever for a presidential candidate.

As one guest could be heard coughing and attendees yelled out, “Rigged!” and “We love you!” the president asked the supportive crowd, “We got 75 million, and we can’t win the election?”

2020-12-10 05:51:02+00:00,107,"MITCHELL, S.D. — A cold wind whipped through the prairie as they laid Buck Timmins to rest.

Timmins, a longtime coach and referee, was not the first person in Mitchell, S.D., pop. 15,600, to die of the coronavirus. He was not even the first that week.

As the funeral director tucked blankets over the knees of Timmins’s wife, Nanci, Pastor Rhonda Wellsandt-Zell told the small group of masked mourners that just as there had been seasons in the coach’s life — basketball season, football season, volleyball season — Mitchell was now enduring a phase of its own.

Pandemic season.

In a state where the Republican governor, Kristi L. Noem, has defied calls for a statewide mask mandate even as cases hit record levels, many in this rural community an hour west of Sioux Falls ignored the virus for months, not bothering with masks or social distancing. Restaurants were packed. Big weddings and funerals went on as planned.

Then people started dying. The wife of the former bank president. A state legislator. The guy whose family has owned the bike shop since 1959. Then Timmins, a mild-spoken 72-year-old who had worked with hundreds of local kids during six decades as a Little League and high school coach and referee.

His death shook Mitchell just as its leaders were contemplating something previously denounced and dismissed: a requirement that its staunchly conservative residents wear masks.

As Wellsandt-Zell led those mourning Timmins in the hymn “Jesus Loves Me,” the rumble of an approaching helicopter cut through the sound of the singing and the mourners’ soft tears. In Mitchell, the medical emergency helicopter, once a rare occurrence, now comes nearly every day, ferrying the growing number of people desperately ill with covid-19 to a hospital that might be able to save them.

Sirens echoing through the empty streets of New York marked the pandemic’s first phase. Swirling blades of helicopters on the American plains is the soundtrack of a deadly fall.

Oh, my God, here we go again, Wellsandt-Zell thought. Another one.

‘We trusted each other’

News of Buck Timmins’s death spread quickly through town just hours before the first vote.

Kevin McCardle, the city council president, heard the news in a text from a fellow referee and was shocked. He had not even known Timmins was sick. How could he be dead when McCardle had seen him filling up his tank at the gas station just a few days ago?

Timmins fell ill with the virus Oct. 24, his wife said. She was pretty sure he picked it up at one of the many games he went to, where people were casual about wearing masks.

“You may need a mask to get in the door, but once you were inside, you looked around and there were 300 people in the seats watching volleyball, pretty much going maskless,” she said. “Mitchell, South Dakota, is a small town. We trusted each other.”

Nanci had stitched Buck a mask out of quilt scraps — in the most manly pattern she could find, brown with little yellow flowers — but she wasn’t sure if he always wore it when he was out of her sight.

They both became ill at the same time, but Nanci had a mild case. Buck seemed okay, too, until about a week in, when he became weaker and weaker and didn’t want to eat or drink, or leave his old brown leather recliner. She plied him with all the flavors of Gatorade, Smartwater and Ensure she could find, but he drank very little. Because Buck was not having trouble breathing and the hospital had patients who were far sicker, he stayed at home. Nanci, a retired X-ray technologist, administered his oxygen and insulin treatments.

That morning, Nov. 16, Buck woke after a restless night and called out for his wife. He mumbled something — she thought he said, “I love you” — so she wrapped her arms around his head and said, “I love you, too!” Just after noon, he was gone. They had planned on taking an Alaskan cruise together next year, but now she was alone, 10 days before Thanksgiving with a stack of bills on the table she wasn’t sure how to pay.

“It’s just — not there,” she said. “So much life left, and then it’s just not there.”

Three hours later, McCardle walked into the Corn Palace, the city’s civic center and auditorium, with Buck Timmins’s death heavy on his mind. Timmins had coached in his Little League. They had refereed high school sports together. Now his eyes rested briefly on the spot in the bleachers behind the visitor’s bench where Timmins, in his role as state coordinator for high school refs, always sat during games.

McCardle had a yellow legal pad under his arm with his daily tally of coronavirus cases in Davison County since March. The growth he had been so carefully recording had exploded in recent weeks, with 359 cases Oct. 1 to 1,912 that morning, a 433 percent increase. Locally, 10 people had died in less than seven weeks. South Dakota now has the largest increase in deaths per capita in the nation, according to Washington Post data from Dec. 8.

The positivity rate at two local testing sites — a key indicator of the virus’s hold on a community — was 33 percent at the beginning of November and would soar to 49 percent near the end of the month, according to Avera Queen of Peace Hospital in Mitchell.

Queen of Peace, which only has eight ICU beds, became overwhelmed and sometimes had to turn patients away, opening up a second covid-19 wing Nov. 8 that filled quickly. Doctors warned of a 50 to 100 percent increase in hospitalizations in the weeks to come. “GOD BE WITH US,” the pandemic-inspired sign outside a feed store read.

McCardle said he found the numbers as alarming as the public health officials did. He is a 57-year-old camper salesman whose biggest worry as council president before the coronavirus was cleaning up algae in the town lake. But when Susan Tjarks, the lone female member on the council, had raised the idea of a mask mandate a month earlier, he had ridiculed her for wearing one and grumbled: “You don’t see the grocery stores putting mandatory masks in. Nobody would go to ‘em. They’d lose business.”

But now McCardle and others on the council, rattled by Timmins’s death, listened attentively to Tjarks’s proposal, sitting at socially spaced tables on the auditorium’s basketball court in front of murals depicting their hardy pioneer ancestors. The draft ordinance would require masks in public buildings and businesses, with a possible fine of up to $500 and 30 days in jail.

Tjarks, who owns a drapery company called Gotcha Covered, is a conservative Republican. But she became convinced the city had to act as deaths began tearing a deep hole in the community’s civic heart.

“What we have been doing isn’t working,” she told the city council. “I don’t want to lose any more friends. I don’t want to lose any more neighbors. We have to do what we need to do to step up and prevent these cases from rising.”

So many town leaders have died in such a short time that the impact has been profound, Tjarks said. Who will fill Timmins’s shoes as a mentor for young referees in the state high school athletic association? Who will raise money for the veteran’s park and the rodeo stampede now that state legislator Lance Carson is gone? There would be smaller absences too: her neighbor, John, now missing from the morning group at the doughnut shop.

Throughout the autumn, towns all over the Midwest in conservative states where Republican governors have avoided mask mandates have tried to pass their own restrictions, often prompting virulent community debate. The town of Huron, S.D., just up the road passed one, as did Washington, Mo. In Muskogee, Okla., the city council finally passed a mandate after several tries; one of its pro-mask members had even wheeled in a casket as a prop.

During the public comment section in Mitchell, a handful of anti-maskers spoke, alleging that masks don’t work and that the measure was an overreach that would violate their civil rights. Local doctors and nurses overrun by covid-19 patients pleaded for help.

“Every single day, I come to work and have more and more positive covids,” said Diane Kenkel, a nurse practitioner who runs a small independent health clinic in town. “The stress on the hospital is very real. It’s really scary as a provider to come to work and have very ill people and know there might not be a hospital bed for you.”

Ultimately, the Mitchell City Council passed the draft measure unanimously Nov. 16. But Mayor Bob Everson — one of the mask-doubters — still had to issue an executive order to put it in place. And the draft had to survive what was expected to be contentious public hearing and final vote the following week.

‘There’s hope’

The following day was a bad one, the worst so far in the pandemic, at Kenkel’s small health-care practice located in a low-slung brown brick building just a block from the Corn Palace.

After her last patient of the day, Kenkel, 62, had hung up her only blue protective gown, tucked the N95 mask that she has been using since March in a paper bag, sat down at her desk and took a sip of the cold coffee she had been trying to finish since morning. Her poodle, Junie B., a registered therapy dog, curled up in a sheepskin bed alongside her.

Kenkel was barely out of the shower that morning when one of her longtime patients — a young mother of four — texted to say her coronavirus symptoms had worsened and she was having trouble breathing. What should she do?

With symptoms that acute, Kenkel would have normally sent the woman to the hospital. But there were no beds available, so she had to arrange to send oxygen to the woman’s home. Avera — the hospital system that runs Queen of Peace — expanded its home health-care program to include covid-19 patients this summer and now 1,400 people across the system, some who would normally be treated in a hospital, are being treated at home.

Like the young mother. And then the firefighter with whom Kenkel had a Zoom call after that, who — unbelievably but truly — was suffering through his second coronavirus infection. He was sicker than she had ever seen him, Kenkel said. He had so far resisted going to the emergency room, because he was afraid he was going to die.

It was the week that the pandemic became personal. Four friends, including Timmins, had died. Her younger patients were suddenly becoming acutely ill when they had not been before. She had known the young mother since before she had her babies. She knew the firefighter because he had worked with her husband, Kevin, the town’s library director, on the local jazz fest.

She was exhausted. Exhausted from having to come home, shower immediately, cook dinner while wearing a mask, then sleep separately from her husband. Exhausted from not being able to touch or hug her patients, or hold their hands while she prayed for them.

It felt like she was living in an alternative universe these days, where seriously ill covid-19 patients overwhelmed the hospital and her clinic and neighbors were dying as folks were living their lives, eating out in restaurants, drinking in bars and attending weddings, funerals and the Pheasants Forever fundraising banquet.

Then there were the patients who didn’t even believe the coronavirus was real. That week, a patient in his 40s came in for a physical — he was high-risk and asthmatic — and his gaiter pushed down when she walked into the exam room. He said he couldn’t breathe in it and didn’t believe the whole pandemic thing anyway. People were dying from pneumonia because they were being forced to wear masks, he told her.

“The next thing you’re going to be calling me to come in and take the vaccine, and I’m telling you right now I’m not going to get it,” he told her.

Kenkel told him calmly that the research he was reading was flawed. She didn’t raise her voice but later questioned herself — why she had felt the need to sway somebody’s opinion in the exam room?

“To have people say it’s not real, that’s just unbelievable,” she said. “Well, they haven’t seen what I’ve seen. So maybe it is unbelievable. They just want to believe it’s not true.”

At her desk, she opened her email. First, there was a note from a statistician with an update on the virus’s spread — a color-coded map of South Dakota that showed active cases skyrocketing in many counties. Then, the good news, an email from her husband saying the mayor had issued an emergency order for masks that would stand until the final vote in a week.

“So that’s making my day better,” Kenkel said, her eyes filling with tears. “There’s hope.”

‘Ladies and gentlemen, the virus is real'

Staff and students have been wearing masks since the school board passed its own mandate in July, which has allowed them to keep schools open for in-person learning for all 4,000 students. And they seemed to be working: A high school science teacher did an analysis that showed the infection rate was about 3.8 percent at the schools compared with 10 percent in Davison County as a whole.

Nonetheless, a vocal group of anti-maskers continued to protest that decision even though the district has no intention of changing its mind. That led to a viral video in September showing a burly man refusing to leave the meeting after being asked to put on a mask. “Force me out!” he taunts the officers who came to lead him away, while a woman films the scene and screams, “This is an embarrassment!” The man, Reed Bender, a local sewer and drain technician, was later charged with obstructing police. Bender declined to comment.

Mitchell Schools Superintendent Joe Graves said the schools were considering moving their board meetings online to avoid such scenes going forward.

“We don’t want this to become an open wound in the long term,” he said, or “an ongoing scar.”

The current council debate had re-energized the anti-maskers, and they pelted city officials with calls and emails running 2 to 1 against, exhorting members of its closed Facebook group to come to the meeting to protest.

The night of the final vote, a cold, clear evening in the 30s, more than 100 people gathered at the Corn Palace, sitting spaced out in the venue’s faded blue folding seats. The “World’s Only Corn Palace” and its whimsical domes had showcased the town’s agricultural bounty and brought tourists to town since 1892, and seen Mitchell through fires, floods and the blizzards of 1949 and 1966. Now, men and women stood ready to debate for hours over the utility of a 4-by-7-inch piece of cloth during the worst public health crisis the town had seen in a century.

Thirteen deaths from covid-19 were reported in Davison County during the week between votes.

The anti-mask forces sat with naked faces, defying the mayor’s order. One by one, they got up to air their grievances. They wept. They swore. They cited junk science: Positivity defeats the virus. So does a healthy lifestyle, eating wild-caught sardines, pasture-raised beef liver and drinking raw organic kombucha. A young mother stood up and compared anti-maskers to Jews persecuted in the Holocaust: “The bare face is the new yellow star of Nazi Germany,” she said.

Mack Miller, 33, a member of the Army National Guard who did two tours overseas, got up to say he had sacrificed his family life to serve and protect the country’s freedoms.

“Wear a mask if you want to; that is your right,” he said. “Choice is what makes America, America. Our own voice, our own choice, our own freedoms.”

As the evening wore on, members of the beleaguered medical community could not hide their distress.

“I cannot even remember how many death certificates I have signed in the last few days,” Buck Timmins’s doctor, Lucio N. Margallo II, told the crowd. In fact, he had lost eight people in the last week.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the virus is real. It’s not a fantasy. It’s deadly, and it’s surging out of control. Scared? Yes I’m scared. … I’m scared for everybody and scared for myself.”

Kenkel got up to speak following one anti-masker who seemed to be in the throes of a respiratory infection.

“I’m scared to stand right here because of the people coughing and hacking,” she said, before pleading: “Please stand firm. We’re dependent on you guys. Amen.”

Despite his executive order, Mayor Bob Everson was one of the mask doubters.

After the public comment period was over, the council immediately got busy stripping the mandate of its penalties. They removed the city’s fine, leaving only the court costs of about $90, should it come to that. They were opting for a “soft approach,” the mayor said, to “educate” people.

“We’re putting together an ordinance that has no teeth!” McCardle, the council president, protested. He had spent the week agonizing over his decision. One day he was for it, the next day he was against. He would miss his friend Buck Timmins at all the games, but he was also moved by the soldier. Miller had served to protect our country’s freedoms — how could McCardle vote to take them away?

But in the end, McCardle couldn’t even bring himself to vote for the toothless mandate, which passed 5 to 3.

The resulting decision — “chickens---,” Miller deemed it — made few on either side happy. The town was divided as ever, and people of Mitchell still had to wake up the next morning and face each other at the grocery store, church and the local sushi restaurant.

By the end of the night, mostly anti-maskers remained in the auditorium. Kenkel had ducked out just after she spoke, going home to write up 18 patient charts before bed, including six patients seriously ill with covid-19. She was long gone by the time one city councilman hopefully suggested that maybe they wouldn’t have any mask citations after all this, and the mayor pointed at the crowd and said, “Did you listen to these people?” and they all laughed.

My friend’s second email ended, “Please send your prayers.” Her cousin, a Black man in his 50s, had just tested positive inside California State Prison-Corcoran. Her first email had shared his impending sense of doom. That day had started with news of a covid-19 death in his facility. Next, first one roommate and then another were removed after testing positive. Then, by day’s end, the news came that there were more people in covid wards than in regular housing. Now, her cousin, too, had tested positive.

Another friend wrote me about her cousin, another Black man in his 50s, this one in Texas, who described people with covid in his prison being housed in unheated tents without any medical care. He described watching stretchers go from the tent to the medical facility — writing that he believed infected people were being moved to medical care only once they were too sick to walk.

In this pandemic, America’s incarcerated people are suffering far beyond most Americans. As the COVID Prison Project reports, as of Dec. 2, the rate of covid-19 in the prison population was nearly four times that of the general population. Prison staff are also suffering, although data on that front is less complete. With the news of vaccines, the end is in sight for those of us on the outside, but not for most of those inside.

As states roll out their vaccine programs, they are typically prioritizing high-risk health-care workers, first responders, people with significant comorbidities, residents in congregate settings, and older adults in congregate and overcrowded settings, often roughly aligning with recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Incarcerated populations come in subsequent tiers of vaccination — or, in the draft plans of 13 states, they don’t show up at all.

But, of course, prisons house all of the categories of people who are in the first tier — health-care workers in high-risk settings, correctional officers who are first responders, people with underlying conditions and older adults in overcrowded settings. And our state and federal governments have a direct responsibility for the health of people who are in their custodial care.

Bad health care should never be part of someone’s penal sanction. Nor should we ignore failings on this front on the grounds that the people facing a health crisis are convicted offenders. They are human beings, whose rights and dignity should be evident in our decision-making about them. Whatever our governments do to incarcerated people, they do in our names.

We should therefore lift up and celebrate the nine states and one territory that have done the right thing by including incarcerated populations in the first tier for vaccine prioritization. These are: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Nebraska, North Carolina, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Puerto Rico. Thank you for your moral clarity and leadership.

Follow Danielle Allen 's opinions Follow

These states have recognized both the humanity of people in their prisons and their full belonging to our community.

For too long, our approach to punishment has drawn on a practice of alienation, of placing offenders out of sight and, so, out of mind, of banishing them into contexts where the establishment of healthy social relationships requires conjuring honey from stones.

But human beings are social animals, who by and large need healthy relationships and memberships in a healthy community to thrive. While offenders are serving their sentences, the goal for most is to make it to the end, to survive and to have the chance to reconnect in healthy ways with society. But reconnection will require a set of mental and psychological muscles that have to be developed over time, not just switched on when a person walks outside the prison doors. Prison itself works against the necessary kind of growth offenders often need. So, too, does society’s deeply ingrained habit of turning its back on prisoners.

Advertisement

Actions speak louder than words. States making the decision to include incarcerated populations in their first tier of prioritization for vaccine distribution are restoring a broken social bond. The decision pulls incarcerated people back into community and social belonging.

That commitment — to see incarcerated people through a lens of human, relational connection — could transform our entire system of justice, if we could build on it and make decisions consistently focused on a principle of our being one community.

I am praying for my friend’s cousin. Join me.

BERLIN — German officials have placed one of the country’s most influential groups opposed to coronavirus restrictions under surveillance, citing its growing radicalization and ties to the far-right. The Querdenken 711 group is considered one of the early driving forces behind the country’s nationwide demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions, which drew tens of thousands this year and have in recent months been accompanied by a growing violent undercurrent.

Tensions escalated in mid-November when thousands of protesters clashed with police in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Wednesday’s move is effectively a public warning to sympathizers and leaders of the group — which officials described as the “epicenter” of Germany’s coronavirus protests — but it falls short of banning the movement.

The group and its allies could still be set to gain more momentum in the coming weeks as some federal states appear poised to impose tougher measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Germany confirmed 590 new coronavirus deaths Wednesday, its so far highest daily toll, bringing the number of total fatalities to around 20,000.

In an emotional speech Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament that the high daily death toll is “unacceptable.”

She pleaded with Germans — and federal state leaders — to follow scientific advice and to adhere to stricter rules.

In Germany, curbs are mostly decided by regional governments, and Merkel cannot impose a nationwide lockdown without their support.

Some federal states have hesitated to tighten restrictions, even though the country’s existing curbs have so far been widely accepted as necessary by the vast majority of Germans, with over 70 percent of respondents saying in a survey last week that the measures are appropriate or should be even tougher.

Restrictions have met growing resistance among an increasingly radicalized group of virus skeptics, however, of whom some have echoed conspiracy theories by the U.S.-born QAnon movement and others allied themselves with Germany’s far-right.

Wednesday’s announcement that authorities will monitor the Querdenken 711 group came after officials expressed mounting concerns over sympathizers who trivialize the Holocaust, among other indications for a growing far-right influence within the movement.

Its surveillance will initially be conducted by authorities in the western German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the group is located, but could be extended to other states. The group’s name — Querdenken 711 — is derived from a Baden-Wuerttemberg phone code and translates as “thinking outside the box.”

Ahead of a meeting of Germany’s state-level interior ministers that was set to begin Wednesday, officials warned that the group and its allies have introduced a novel form of extremism across Germany.

“Extremist, conspiratorial and anti-Semitic content is increasingly being mixed with legitimate criticism of the state-led measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic,” Beate Bube, the president of Baden-Wuerttemberg intelligence service, said Wednesday of the group’s radicalization.

Bube added that members of the group are tied to Germany’s far-right Reichsbuerger movement, known for its rejection of the modern German state.

Even though the move to put the group on the state’s extremism watch-list appeared to have largely been triggered by the movement’s ties to the far-right, Germany’s coronavirus protests have drawn a politically heterogenous mix of demonstrators, with some identifying as left-wing or far-leftist and others condemning extremism.

Querdenken 711′s founder, Michael Ballweg, criticized the decision to monitor his group as an effort to “intimidate peaceful demonstrators” based on “completely baseless rumors.”

Such assertions have been disputed by German officials, who maintain that the protests could draw demonstrators to violence.

“We see with the latest events that there is an escalation toward more violence and to more right-wing extremism among the demonstrations,” Stephan Kramer, president of the intelligence service in the eastern German federal state of Thuringia, said last month.

Analysts have also voiced alarm over bomb- and weapon-making materials that have been circulated among coronavirus-skeptics. In October, the German federal agency responsible for controlling the coronavirus, the Robert Koch Institute, was attacked with molotov cocktails.

When Ashley Antonio contracted covid-19 in late March, the Canadian criminal lawyer fought against the common symptoms that come with most cases: fever, body aches, fatigue, headaches. She would manage her symptoms at home and eventually overcome them, she assured herself. After all, she was a healthy 35-year-old with no underlying conditions who boxed and did strength training four times a week.

Except the symptoms never really went away — they intensified.

Now, 259 days later, Antonio is still suffering the repercussions of a virus that has upended almost every aspect of her life.

She has been in and out of the hospital four times in almost nine months. Her doctors have diagnosed Antonio with arthritis and a condition that causes her heartbeat to dramatically increase when she stands up. Both are long-term effects of the virus, they told her. They also don’t know if, and when, those symptoms will go away.

“Everyone is just told you either recover or you die,” Antonio told The Washington Post on Tuesday. “There’s never talk of all the people that are trapped somewhere in the middle with all of these long-term effects. We’re not recovered. We’re just not covid-positive anymore.”

Antonio is not alone. Doctors still aren’t sure why “long-haulers” continue to suffer the consequences of the disease months later or whether the symptoms will stay with them for the rest of their lives. But public health experts say it’s increasingly clear that many thousands of patients face long-term effects from the virus.

Long-haulers “are in every country, in every language,” Igor J. Koralnik, who started a program for covid-19 neurocognitive problems at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, told The Post in October. “It’s going to be a big problem. It’s not going to go away.”

So far, clinicians have learned the long-term effects can impact both the old and the young, regardless of whether the case was mild or required hospitalization. Many long-haulers have turned to social media groups to share their experiences and advice.

Antonio, who lives in Edmonton and whose story was first reported by the CBC, said she had been taking precautions and working from home for a month before she got sick. Her best guess is that she caught the virus on a run to the grocery store. She began feeling symptoms around March 25.

But because she did not have a cough, which doctors and health experts then said was one of covid-19′s main symptoms, Antonio thought she only had a stomach flu.

She stayed home and started to feel like herself again days later. But every time she thought she was recovering, symptoms would return. In the next three months, old symptoms and new, graver ones left Antonio tied to her couch. The fatigue was so bad she could shower only a couple of times a week. Her blood oxygen levels would drop dangerously low whenever she took short steps. One day, her brain was so foggy that she could not remember how to hold a glass.

It wasn’t until mid-May when she was taken to the emergency room for the first time. Alone in her bedroom and fighting a high fever, Antonio began hallucinating. Then, she could not feel half of her body or her face. The hospital tested her for the coronavirus, but her results came back negative so she was sent home. About a week later, she was back. She would return two more times in the following months.

“I had every test you could imagine,” she said. But her doctors could still not figure out what exactly was wrong with her. An emergency room doctor suggested she might have long-term covid-19 effects and referred her to a special clinic.

In June, she tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. In July, doctors at a clinic for coronavirus survivors diagnosed her with arthritis and a condition that causes her heartbeat to raise significantly when standing. “But doctors couldn’t explain why my oxygen was still dropping every time I walked or any other symptoms,” she said.

Antonio turned to other long-haulers for more information, joining a Facebook group where she learned, for example, that she wasn’t alone in smelling cigarettes when no one was smoking near her. Other people experienced random smells too, they told her.

“I had a lot of questions and the doctors didn’t have a lot of answers. It was all so new to everyone,” Antonio said. “I just wanted to see if what I was experiencing was ‘normal.’ It was very comforting to know that I wasn’t alone.”

Although her symptoms persisted, in August, Antonio voluntarily returned to the law firm where she works as a criminal lawyer. Some days, she feels okay. But the increased heart rate, shortness of breath, joint pain and headaches are usually daily ailments. She also still suffers from blurry vision and gets skin rashes. Her doctors have now told her it’s possible that her long-term symptoms will come and go for the rest of her life. For now, Antonio said she is taking it one day at a time.

“I’m definitely worried it will be permanent,” she said. “It’s very overwhelming if I think that this is how the rest of my life is going to be.”

Antonio added: “When I have a good day, I no longer think that it will be over. I know I’ll have bad days again. It makes you feel hopeless.”

2020-12-09 14:20:36+00:00,145,"MITCHELL, S.D. — A cold wind whipped through the prairie as they laid Buck Timmins to rest.

Timmins, a longtime coach and referee, was not the first person in Mitchell, S.D., pop. 15,600, to die of the coronavirus. He was not even the first that week.

As the funeral director tucked blankets over the knees of Timmins’s wife, Nanci, Pastor Rhonda Wellsandt-Zell told the small group of masked mourners that just as there had been seasons in the coach’s life — basketball season, football season, volleyball season — Mitchell was now enduring a phase of its own.

Pandemic season.

In a state where the Republican governor, Kristi L. Noem, has defied calls for a statewide mask mandate even as cases hit record levels, many in this rural community an hour west of Sioux Falls ignored the virus for months, not bothering with masks or social distancing. Restaurants were packed. Big weddings and funerals went on as planned.

Then people started dying. The wife of the former bank president. A state legislator. The guy whose family has owned the bike shop since 1959. Then Timmins, a mild-spoken 72-year-old who had worked with hundreds of local kids during six decades as a Little League and high school coach and referee.

His death shook Mitchell just as its leaders were contemplating something previously denounced and dismissed: a requirement that its staunchly conservative residents wear masks.

As Wellsandt-Zell led those mourning Timmins in the hymn “Jesus Loves Me,” the rumble of an approaching helicopter cut through the sound of the singing and the mourners’ soft tears. In Mitchell, the medical emergency helicopter, once a rare occurrence, now comes nearly every day, ferrying the growing number of people desperately ill with covid-19 to a hospital that might be able to save them.

Sirens echoing through the empty streets of New York marked the pandemic’s first phase. Swirling blades of helicopters on the American plains is the soundtrack of a deadly fall.

Oh, my God, here we go again, Wellsandt-Zell thought. Another one.

‘We trusted each other’

News of Buck Timmins’s death spread quickly through town just hours before the first vote.

Kevin McCardle, the city council president, heard the news in a text from a fellow referee and was shocked. He had not even known Timmins was sick. How could he be dead when McCardle had seen him filling up his tank at the gas station just a few days ago?

Timmins fell ill with the virus Oct. 24, his wife said. She was pretty sure he picked it up at one of the many games he went to, where people were casual about wearing masks.

“You may need a mask to get in the door, but once you were inside, you looked around and there were 300 people in the seats watching volleyball, pretty much going maskless,” she said. “Mitchell, South Dakota, is a small town. We trusted each other.”

Nanci had stitched Buck a mask out of quilt scraps — in the most manly pattern she could find, brown with little yellow flowers — but she wasn’t sure if he always wore it when he was out of her sight.

They both became ill at the same time, but Nanci had a mild case. Buck seemed okay, too, until about a week in, when he became weaker and weaker and didn’t want to eat or drink, or leave his old brown leather recliner. She plied him with all the flavors of Gatorade, Smartwater and Ensure she could find, but he drank very little. Because Buck was not having trouble breathing and the hospital had patients who were far sicker, he stayed at home. Nanci, a retired X-ray technologist, administered his oxygen and insulin treatments.

That morning, Nov. 16, Buck woke after a restless night and called out for his wife. He mumbled something — she thought he said, “I love you” — so she wrapped her arms around his head and said, “I love you, too!” Just after noon, he was gone. They had planned on taking an Alaskan cruise together next year, but now she was alone, 10 days before Thanksgiving with a stack of bills on the table she wasn’t sure how to pay.

“It’s just — not there,” she said. “So much life left, and then it’s just not there.”

Three hours later, McCardle walked into the Corn Palace, the city’s civic center and auditorium, with Buck Timmins’s death heavy on his mind. Timmins had coached in his Little League. They had refereed high school sports together. Now his eyes rested briefly on the spot in the bleachers behind the visitor’s bench where Timmins, in his role as state coordinator for high school refs, always sat during games.

McCardle had a yellow legal pad under his arm with his daily tally of coronavirus cases in Davison County since March. The growth he had been so carefully recording had exploded in recent weeks, with 359 cases Oct. 1 to 1,912 that morning, a 433 percent increase. Locally, 10 people had died in less than seven weeks. South Dakota now has the largest increase in deaths per capita in the nation, according to Washington Post data from Dec. 8.

The positivity rate at two local testing sites — a key indicator of the virus’s hold on a community — was 33 percent at the beginning of November and would soar to 49 percent near the end of the month, according to Avera Queen of Peace Hospital in Mitchell.

Queen of Peace, which only has eight ICU beds, became overwhelmed and sometimes had to turn patients away, opening up a second covid-19 wing Nov. 8 that filled quickly. Doctors warned of a 50 to 100 percent increase in hospitalizations in the weeks to come. “GOD BE WITH US,” the pandemic-inspired sign outside a feed store read.

McCardle said he found the numbers as alarming as the public health officials did. He is a 57-year-old camper salesman whose biggest worry as council president before the coronavirus was cleaning up algae in the town lake. But when Susan Tjarks, the lone female member on the council, had raised the idea of a mask mandate a month earlier, he had ridiculed her for wearing one and grumbled: “You don’t see the grocery stores putting mandatory masks in. Nobody would go to ‘em. They’d lose business.”

But now McCardle and others on the council, rattled by Timmins’s death, listened attentively to Tjarks’s proposal, sitting at socially spaced tables on the auditorium’s basketball court in front of murals depicting their hardy pioneer ancestors. The draft ordinance would require masks in public buildings and businesses, with a possible fine of up to $500 and 30 days in jail.

Tjarks, who owns a drapery company called Gotcha Covered, is a conservative Republican. But she became convinced the city had to act as deaths began tearing a deep hole in the community’s civic heart.

“What we have been doing isn’t working,” she told the city council. “I don’t want to lose any more friends. I don’t want to lose any more neighbors. We have to do what we need to do to step up and prevent these cases from rising.”

So many town leaders have died in such a short time that the impact has been profound, Tjarks said. Who will fill Timmins’s shoes as a mentor for young referees in the state high school athletic association? Who will raise money for the veteran’s park and the rodeo stampede now that state legislator Lance Carson is gone? There would be smaller absences too: her neighbor, John, now missing from the morning group at the doughnut shop.

Throughout the autumn, towns all over the Midwest in conservative states where Republican governors have avoided mask mandates have tried to pass their own restrictions, often prompting virulent community debate. The town of Huron, S.D., just up the road passed one, as did Washington, Mo. In Muskogee, Okla., the city council finally passed a mandate after several tries; one of its pro-mask members had even wheeled in a casket as a prop.

During the public comment section in Mitchell, a handful of anti-maskers spoke, alleging that masks don’t work and that the measure was an overreach that would violate their civil rights. Local doctors and nurses overrun by covid-19 patients pleaded for help.

“Every single day, I come to work and have more and more positive covids,” said Diane Kenkel, a nurse practitioner who runs a small independent health clinic in town. “The stress on the hospital is very real. It’s really scary as a provider to come to work and have very ill people and know there might not be a hospital bed for you.”

Ultimately, the Mitchell City Council passed the draft measure unanimously Nov. 16. But Mayor Bob Everson — one of the mask-doubters — still had to issue an executive order to put it in place. And the draft had to survive what was expected to be contentious public hearing and final vote the following week.

‘There’s hope’

The following day was a bad one, the worst so far in the pandemic, at Kenkel’s small health-care practice located in a low-slung brown brick building just a block from the Corn Palace.

After her last patient of the day, Kenkel, 62, had hung up her only blue protective gown, tucked the N95 mask that she has been using since March in a paper bag, sat down at her desk and took a sip of the cold coffee she had been trying to finish since morning. Her poodle, Junie B., a registered therapy dog, curled up in a sheepskin bed alongside her.

Kenkel was barely out of the shower that morning when one of her longtime patients — a young mother of four — texted to say her coronavirus symptoms had worsened and she was having trouble breathing. What should she do?

With symptoms that acute, Kenkel would have normally sent the woman to the hospital. But there were no beds available, so she had to arrange to send oxygen to the woman’s home. Avera — the hospital system that runs Queen of Peace — expanded its home health-care program to include covid-19 patients this summer and now 1,400 people across the system, some who would normally be treated in a hospital, are being treated at home.

Like the young mother. And then the firefighter with whom Kenkel had a Zoom call after that, who — unbelievably but truly — was suffering through his second coronavirus infection. He was sicker than she had ever seen him, Kenkel said. He had so far resisted going to the emergency room, because he was afraid he was going to die.

It was the week that the pandemic became personal. Four friends, including Timmins, had died. Her younger patients were suddenly becoming acutely ill when they had not been before. She had known the young mother since before she had her babies. She knew the firefighter because he had worked with her husband, Kevin, the town’s library director, on the local jazz fest.

She was exhausted. Exhausted from having to come home, shower immediately, cook dinner while wearing a mask, then sleep separately from her husband. Exhausted from not being able to touch or hug her patients, or hold their hands while she prayed for them.

It felt like she was living in an alternative universe these days, where seriously ill covid-19 patients overwhelmed the hospital and her clinic and neighbors were dying as folks were living their lives, eating out in restaurants, drinking in bars and attending weddings, funerals and the Pheasants Forever fundraising banquet.

Then there were the patients who didn’t even believe the coronavirus was real. That week, a patient in his 40s came in for a physical — he was high-risk and asthmatic — and his gaiter pushed down when she walked into the exam room. He said he couldn’t breathe in it and didn’t believe the whole pandemic thing anyway. People were dying from pneumonia because they were being forced to wear masks, he told her.

“The next thing you’re going to be calling me to come in and take the vaccine, and I’m telling you right now I’m not going to get it,” he told her.

Kenkel told him calmly that the research he was reading was flawed. She didn’t raise her voice but later questioned herself — why she had felt the need to sway somebody’s opinion in the exam room?

“To have people say it’s not real, that’s just unbelievable,” she said. “Well, they haven’t seen what I’ve seen. So maybe it is unbelievable. They just want to believe it’s not true.”

At her desk, she opened her email. First, there was a note from a statistician with an update on the virus’s spread — a color-coded map of South Dakota that showed active cases skyrocketing in many counties. Then, the good news, an email from her husband saying the mayor had issued an emergency order for masks that would stand until the final vote in a week.

“So that’s making my day better,” Kenkel said, her eyes filling with tears. “There’s hope.”

‘Ladies and gentlemen, the virus is real'

Staff and students have been wearing masks since the school board passed its own mandate in July, which has allowed them to keep schools open for in-person learning for all 4,000 students. And they seemed to be working: A high school science teacher did an analysis that showed the infection rate was about 3.8 percent at the schools compared with 10 percent in Davison County as a whole.

Nonetheless, a vocal group of anti-maskers continued to protest that decision even though the district has no intention of changing its mind. That led to a viral video in September showing a burly man refusing to leave the meeting after being asked to put on a mask. “Force me out!” he taunts the officers who came to lead him away, while a woman films the scene and screams, “This is an embarrassment!” The man, Reed Bender, a local sewer and drain technician, was later charged with obstructing police. Bender declined to comment.

Mitchell Schools Superintendent Joe Graves said the schools were considering moving their board meetings online to avoid such scenes going forward.

“We don’t want this to become an open wound in the long term,” he said, or “an ongoing scar.”

The current council debate had re-energized the anti-maskers, and they pelted city officials with calls and emails running 2 to 1 against, exhorting members of its closed Facebook group to come to the meeting to protest.

The night of the final vote, a cold, clear evening in the 30s, more than 100 people gathered at the Corn Palace, sitting spaced out in the venue’s faded blue folding seats. The “World’s Only Corn Palace” and its whimsical domes had showcased the town’s agricultural bounty and brought tourists to town since 1892, and seen Mitchell through fires, floods and the blizzards of 1949 and 1966. Now, men and women stood ready to debate for hours over the utility of a 4-by-7-inch piece of cloth during the worst public health crisis the town had seen in a century.

Thirteen deaths from covid-19 were reported in Davison County during the week between votes.

The anti-mask forces sat with naked faces, defying the mayor’s order. One by one, they got up to air their grievances. They wept. They swore. They cited junk science: Positivity defeats the virus. So does a healthy lifestyle, eating wild-caught sardines, pasture-raised beef liver and drinking raw organic kombucha. A young mother stood up and compared anti-maskers to Jews persecuted in the Holocaust: “The bare face is the new yellow star of Nazi Germany,” she said.

Mack Miller, 33, a member of the Army National Guard who did two tours overseas, got up to say he had sacrificed his family life to serve and protect the country’s freedoms.

“Wear a mask if you want to; that is your right,” he said. “Choice is what makes America, America. Our own voice, our own choice, our own freedoms.”

As the evening wore on, members of the beleaguered medical community could not hide their distress.

“I cannot even remember how many death certificates I have signed in the last few days,” Buck Timmins’s doctor, Lucio N. Margallo II, told the crowd. In fact, he had lost eight people in the last week.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the virus is real. It’s not a fantasy. It’s deadly, and it’s surging out of control. Scared? Yes I’m scared. … I’m scared for everybody and scared for myself.”

Kenkel got up to speak following one anti-masker who seemed to be in the throes of a respiratory infection.

“I’m scared to stand right here because of the people coughing and hacking,” she said, before pleading: “Please stand firm. We’re dependent on you guys. Amen.”

Despite his executive order, Mayor Bob Everson was one of the mask doubters.

After the public comment period was over, the council immediately got busy stripping the mandate of its penalties. They removed the city’s fine, leaving only the court costs of about $90, should it come to that. They were opting for a “soft approach,” the mayor said, to “educate” people.

“We’re putting together an ordinance that has no teeth!” McCardle, the council president, protested. He had spent the week agonizing over his decision. One day he was for it, the next day he was against. He would miss his friend Buck Timmins at all the games, but he was also moved by the soldier. Miller had served to protect our country’s freedoms — how could McCardle vote to take them away?

But in the end, McCardle couldn’t even bring himself to vote for the toothless mandate, which passed 5 to 3.

The resulting decision — “chickens---,” Miller deemed it — made few on either side happy. The town was divided as ever, and people of Mitchell still had to wake up the next morning and face each other at the grocery store, church and the local sushi restaurant.

By the end of the night, mostly anti-maskers remained in the auditorium. Kenkel had ducked out just after she spoke, going home to write up 18 patient charts before bed, including six patients seriously ill with covid-19. She was long gone by the time one city councilman hopefully suggested that maybe they wouldn’t have any mask citations after all this, and the mayor pointed at the crowd and said, “Did you listen to these people?” and they all laughed.

As a general proposition, U.S. history is more interested in outcomes than in beginnings. Dig into newspapers and diaries from the early months of the Civil War and you might be astonished at how hopeless the Union cause appeared. The North was too divided to subdue such a vast territory as the Confederacy, and Abraham Lincoln was certainly too weak and bumbling for the job. The wise heads of Europe thought this. Leading generals of the Union Army thought this. Much of Lincoln’s Cabinet and his party leaders in Congress thought this.

It comes as a surprise because history’s verdict is determined by the outcome. Of course the North prevailed, the story goes: The Union’s industrial and demographic advantages were too great for the South to overcome. Things could hardly have gone otherwise — so history says.

Or look at World War II: the intelligence failures at Pearl Harbor, the ignominious abandonment of the Philippines, the Bataan death march, the disastrous battle of Kasserine Pass. The U.S. crusade against fascism got off to a terrible start, redeemed in the hindsight of history by lessons learned and the ultimate victory.

Likewise, the history of the covid-19 pandemic will be more interested in how the battle ends than in how it got started. In that respect, the fight begins now.

As many experts predicted, the approach of winter finds us drowning in a new wave of covid-19 cases. Precisely how large a wave is hard to say. Confirmed infections — now averaging more than 200,000 per day in the United States — are carefully tracked and widely reported. Yet evidence shows that most infections are never diagnosed because they produce few, if any, symptoms.

Nor is the number of deaths a perfect measure of the pandemic. Of 2,000-plus victims reported on a recent day, some were people already close to death from other causes. Ending covid would not have saved those lives.

But those two measures point to the same conclusion: The pandemic is as bad or worse than ever, further evidenced by widespread overcrowding in medical facilities — especially the little hospitals and clinics of rural America.

History will elide many of the missteps of last winter provided that we make a better showing from now on. Take, for example, the fiasco of the face coverings. When the novel coronavirus emerged, hospital managers immediately worried they would run short of personal protective equipment, including face masks. To protect existing supplies, authorities assured the public that we’d be fine without masks.

That was a mistake. Masks have proved to be the first line of defense, along with social distancing and clean hands. Even on the cusp of a vaccine, these simple measures are not only our best options against the pandemic; they continue to be the only ones available to engage the nation to meet this challenge.

We’re at a critical point. A magnificent effort by medical researchers has sped us to the beginning of a months-long process of mass vaccinations. With enough patience and cooperation from the public, this offers a real hope of taming the pandemic. In the meantime, however, hospitals and morgues are as taxed by covid-19 as ever.

Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, used data analysis to explain recently in The Post that infections are so widespread that hospitals across the country are sending home patients who, in normal times, would be admitted. The same issue can be illustrated by anecdote rather than analysis. The Associated Press found Eric Lewallen, a radiological technician in rural LaCrosse, Kan., who moved into an RV on the hospital parking lot so that he could be on call 24-7. Everyone else on the hospital staff qualified to take an X-ray was out sick with the virus.

“I’m it,” Lewallen told the AP. “To keep a critical access hospital open, you have to have X-ray and lab functioning,” he said. “If one of those go down, you go on diversion and you lose your ER.”

The vaccine is coming, but the crisis is already here. History’s account of Americans in this pandemic will focus on what we do starting now. Our lack of leadership has been depressing. But we’ve learned enough through these past nine months to make up for absent leadership by exercising citizenship.

Wear a mask in public places and keep a safe distance from others. Wash your hands and use sanitizer frequently. Stay close to home this year and keep your holiday gatherings small. Monitor yourself for symptoms and get tested at the earliest signs. Quarantine if you’re sick.

It’s not Normandy. It’s not Gettysburg. But this is what history demands today. There is just enough time — just barely — left for us to pass the test.

A witness who attracted national attention after testifying at the side of Rudolph W. Giuliani about alleged voter fraud in Michigan says she is not self-quarantining and has not been tested for the coronavirus in the wake of Giuliani’s positive test and hospitalization. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Mellissa Carone testified before state lawmakers on Dec. 2 for about 30 minutes while sitting beside the president’s personal attorney in Lansing, according to a video of the hearing. Neither wore masks. She also posed for photos with Giuliani, who health officials later said was “extremely likely” to have been contagious with the virus at the time.

Health officials in Ingham County, which includes Lansing, on Monday ordered anyone who had been in contact with Giuliani at close range and for more than 15 minutes to self-quarantine after President Trump tweeted that his personal attorney had tested positive for the coronavirus. The county officials said they cannot enforce the directive outside their borders.

In a phone interview Tuesday from her home in the Detroit suburbs, Carone told The Washington Post that she was living her life normally and had no plans to change that. She said she was unaware of the health advisory and was not worried about contracting the virus.

“I would take it seriously if it came from Trump, because Trump cares about American lives,” Carone said, adding that if television networks friendly to Trump such as One America News or Newsmax “told me to go get tested, I would do it.”

“It is not that I don’t believe in getting tested. I don’t trust the tests,” Carone said.

She spoke admiringly of Giuliani, calling him “one of the most respectful, polite, just down-to-earth people I have ever met. He is great.”

Since her appearance with Giuliani, media scrutiny 0f Carone has uncovered biographical information, including a recent criminal conviction.

She has been touted by Trump and Giuliani as a star witness in their effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. So far, the Trump campaign’s allegations of voter fraud have largely been dismissed by judges. Carone’s allegations, which were first introduced in an affidavit in a court case in Michigan, “simply are not credible,” a state judge ruled.

Carone’s Lansing testimony, alleging that Detroit election workers had scanned “tens of thousands” of ballots twice and that ballots had been smuggled into the vote-counting center via food vans, was viewed by millions on social media and prompted a parody on “Saturday Night Live.”

When some state lawmakers expressed incredulity at her claims, she doubled down, becoming increasingly animated. After one lawmaker questioned her allegation that a pollbook’s accounting of the votes was “off by 30,000,” she responded, “I’d say that pollbook is off by over 100,000.”

About two months before she worked at the Detroit election center, Carone finished 12 months of probation after pleading guilty to disorderly conduct in Michigan’s Wayne County, court records show. Carone had originally been charged with obscenity and using a computer to commit a crime, after she was accused of sending videos of herself and her boyfriend having sex to her boyfriend’s ex-wife, according to police records.

Carone initially denied the accusations in an interview with police, according to police and court records, but later told police she had sent them, saying that she had wanted to send her boyfriend’s ex-wife “over the top.”

Asked about the incident, Carone told The Post that “it is sad people are diverting attention from election fraud to something completely different.”

Carone said that she was hired through a temporary staffing services company to do IT work at Detroit’s main ballot-counting center, spending more than 24 hours there on Nov. 3 and 4.

Advertisement

“I have always been involved in politics,” she said, explaining her decision to take the job. “I have very strong political views and morals and I was very interested in that process and I accepted the position. I never expected to walk in there and see what I saw. Never.”

An official for Dominion Voting Systems, a voting technology company, confirmed that Carone worked at the center on those dates as a low-level technician. Other claims that Carone has made in public statements and on professional postings have been disputed.

The 33-year-old mother of two told Michigan lawmakers she has “two degrees.” According to her LinkedIn page, one degree is from the University of Michigan at Dearborn, where officials say they have no record of anyone with her name being enrolled.

Asked about the discrepancy, Carone said in an interview, “I do not have a bachelor’s degree. . . . I am about four classes away from it.” She declined to name the school, saying, “I don’t want them to get harassed.”

Carone also testified in Lansing that she worked at and was later laid off by Ford Motor Company. A spokesman for the company said she has never been employed there. Carone told The Post that she worked as a contractor and pointed to a “Certificate of Recognition” displayed on her LinkedIn page that she said was issued by Ford.

A Ford official told The Post that the certificate was issued by a different company, and that Ford could not discuss its contractors.

Florida police officers with guns drawn raided the home of an ousted health department data scientist Monday morning, searching for the former agency employee’s most powerful tools: her computer, her phone and other hardware that supports the coronavirus website she set up after accusing the state of manipulating its official numbers.

Law enforcement officials allege the scientist, Rebekah Jones, may have also used the devices to hack into a health department website in November and to send an unauthorized message to Florida emergency personnel, urging them to speak out against the state’s pandemic response. She has denied the accusation.

This is the latest clash between Jones and state officials, who have traded accusations since she was fired from the Florida Department of Health this summer. Jones said she had refused to comply with agency requests she considered unethical, and she has accused the state of mismanaging a health crisis that has so far infected more than a million residents and killed nearly 20,000.

After her dismissal, Jones launched her own data portal, advertising it as the transparent and independent alternative to the state dashboard. Now, Jones says, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s raid is an attempt to silence her work.

The armed officers, acting on a search warrant, knocked on the door of Jones’s house in Tallahassee around 8:30 a.m. Monday. A state police spokesperson said the officers announced their arrival, informed Jones they had a search warrant and tried calling her during the 20 minutes before she let them in.

A 30-second video that Jones posted to Twitter captures the tense moments after she opened her door.

Jones has her hands up as one officer orders her to walk outside. She says her husband and kids are still inside. The officer then draws his handgun, walks to the base of a staircase and shouts, “Mr. Jones, come down the stairs — now.” Five seconds later, more officers enter, also brandishing their weapons, and one announces, “Police. Come down now.”

From outside, Jones can be heard yelling, “Do not point that gun at my children” and “He just pointed a gun at my children.”

In tweets hours later, Jones said the officers also pointed their weapons at her and seized her “hardware and tech,” including her phone and computer. She said her devices contained “evidence of corruption at the state level.”

Jones is an outspoken critic of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), and she has alleged her ex-managers directed her to doctor virus case data to downplay risks of infection and death in the state. The health department has denied this.

“This is what happens to scientists who do their job honestly,” Jones wrote. “This is what happens to people who speak truth to power.”

According to an affidavit filed by state police special agent Noel Pratts, authorities traced last month’s breach of a health department Web platform to Jones, the agency’s former geographic information systems manager.

Officials use the platform, ReadyOp, to coordinate emergency response across state agencies. On Nov. 10, members of a group specializing in public health emergencies received a message that read, according to the affidavit, “It’s time to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it’s too late.”

At the time, officials told the Tampa Bay Times they didn’t know who was behind the missive or whether that person was a state employee. Spokesman Jason Mahon called the unsanctioned use “both irresponsible and unlawful.”

Jones did not respond to an interview request, and spokespeople for the health department and DeSantis directed questions about her allegations to the state police.

In a Monday evening interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, Jones repeatedly denied sending the message, saying, “I’m not a hacker.” She warned current health department staffers who she has communicated with since her firing that “DeSantis will know soon enough that you’ve been talking to me, so be careful.” The raid, she said, was not a legitimate investigation but a “thinly veiled attempt by the governor to intimidate scientists.”

Jones’s attorney, Lawrence G. Walters, criticized the police officers’ “unnecessarily reckless and aggressive behavior in the execution of a search warrant for computers.”

“Our client was fully cooperative yet had guns pointed at her and her family,” Walters said, adding that he’s concerned the incident may also be in retaliation to a whistleblower complaint Jones filed against the health department in July.

On Twitter, Jones said she would not be cowed by what she characterized as a state-sanctioned intimidation campaign.

“If Desantis thought pointing a gun in my face was a good way to get me to shut up, he’s about to learn just how wrong he was,” she wrote. “I’ll have a new computer tomorrow. And then I’m going to get back to work.”

2020-12-07 15:02:04+00:00,125,"They have been at this for almost a year. While politicians argued about masks, superspreader weddings made the news, a presidential election came and went, and at least 281,000 Americans died, nurses reported for work. The Post asked seven ICU nurses what it’s been like to care for the sickest covid patients. This is what they want you to know.

Boise, Idaho As of , Idaho has seen -- total confirmed cases and -- deaths . Kori Albi, 31 Covid unit intensive care nurse and unit supervisor, Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center (Angie Smith for The Washington Post) Our staff are getting sick. Our physicians are getting sick. And they’re not getting it from the hospital. They’re getting it from the community. We are almost lucky to care for the covid patients because we know who they are. Anytime we go into these rooms, we know exactly what we need to do. We have all the PPE we need. And as long as we are diligent and follow all the processes that are in place, we can keep ourselves safe. That’s not what worries me at all. Going out into the community is scarier than coming into work every day. Because you don’t know who has it. This virus has caused this feeling, this sense of isolation. The covid unit is an isolated desert. Every door is shut. Every room has negative airflow. By the time you put your N95 mask on and then your surgical mask over the top of that, then you put your isolation gown on and your face shield on top of that, you can’t tell who is who. So much of health care is about that personal touch — now, our patients can’t even see our name badges because they are on under our gowns. All they see are our eyes through our face mask. A lot of families are hesitant to have Zoom calls with patients because it can be uncomfortable and awkward. Especially if these patients are sedated and intubated. There’s always that awkwardness of: Can they hear you? Can they not hear you? Even as nurses, we feel like we’re talking to the wall. But we talk to them just as if they were awake. Allowing families to play their music that they like or pray with them or just talk to them can absolutely help. You see vital signs change. One patient, all she wanted to do was have her son sing her a song. I think I spent over an hour in the room listening to him play the guitar and sing her a song. He sang her mostly hymns. Death is a very intimate event that normally involves a lot of family members that help bring closure and that helps everyone process. In normal circumstances, health care providers form these relationships with the family at the bedside. All of that has been removed. And we now have to try to form those relationships over the telephone. It’s a traumatic experience. And it’s a long drawn-out process. A lot of people don’t make it out of here. It’s a slow, lonely death. The amount of death with covid is profound. As nurses, we have learned to process death, but the amount of death has happened in such a short span of time — that’s what’s been overwhelming. I had a patient that we did a Zoom call with. His four-year-old granddaughter lived with him. And she brought tears to the room. The naivete of a four-year-old. Her grandfather was intubated so he couldn’t talk. But he could kind of look around the room. But the innocence of her, saying, “Come home, Pa. I miss you, Pa. I love you Pa,” all through a video screen. The 14-year-old that also lived with them couldn’t formulate words to say anything, and he didn’t know what to do or say in that video. But the four-year-old was telling Pa to come home. — As told to Carissa Wolf

Jackson, Miss. As of , Mississippi has seen -- total confirmed cases and -- deaths . Catie Carrigan, 28 ICU, University of Mississippi Medical Center There are some patients who have been in their younger 20s and their younger 30s, and I think maybe those are the hardest cases. They have families and they have kids just like I do, and it’s hard coming into work and taking care of them. Knowing they’re supposed to be going to college, they’re supposed to be getting married, they’re supposed to be having kids and, instead, they’re laying in a hospital bed on a ventilator fighting for their life. They have their whole entire lives ahead of them, and then they get hit with this disease that everybody thinks is a hoax and then they die. I worked in the ER a month ago, so I know exactly what’s going on down there, and now I work in the ICU, so I know exactly what’s going on on both sides of it. There are no ICU beds in the hospital. None. When there are no ICU beds, we hold them in the ER, or we hold them in the PACU (post-anesthesia care unit). The ER still has to treat our trauma patients, our car accidents, our gunshot victims. So when we have those ICU holds in the ER, it obviously makes the jobs of nurses and doctors in the ER way more difficult than it needs to be. We are treating patients in the hallway. They’re just trying to do the best they can with the resources that we have. There is no room left, essentially, and I think that’s really what people don’t seem to understand. And I get it, when you’re not in health care you don’t really see our side of it, but we’re seeing the worst of it. It’s hard for us to convey that to the public because they don’t seem to want to take our word for it — but take our word for it. Take our word for it. — As told to Sarah Fowler

Iowa City As of , Iowa has seen -- total confirmed cases and -- deaths . Allison Wynes, 39 Medical intensive care unit, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics I cry every day when I walk in to work, and I cry every day when I walk to my car after work. You get it out of your system before you show up and you do your job and you’re fine. Then, you go home and you cry before you get home. And then you go home and be mom. My 9-year-old daughter asks frequently, “Mommy, how many patients were there today? Mommy, how many sick ones were there today? Were you safe? Was everything okay? Do you have to go to work again? How many patients?” She gets it. I think one thing that people do not appreciate is it’s not only the number or volume of patients that comes through — it’s the level of care that they require, which is so much greater than a standard patient in the ICU or a standard patient in the floor, because they can get very, very sick very quickly. We were walking a patient who was on ECMO, which is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and it took five people to walk her. That’s not normal. I work in the MICU, so it’s never like a party up in here, but it used to at least be, nine times out of ten, calm and controlled and tidy and clean. Occasionally stuff would go bad and we would all run and help, and then we would all go about our days. Now it just feels like, especially of late, there is equipment everywhere. There are gowns everywhere. There are gloves everywhere, there are people everywhere, and there are fires everywhere. I’m actually scared, and I’ve never been scared at work before. I am scared that we will lose control. It’s the human resources we are running low on. We can make a bed, we can find a ventilator, we have PPE. But it’s the human cost of caring for these patients that has been keeping me up at night the past couple of weeks and really making me nauseous every day. I didn’t think it would be over by now, but I didn’t think we’d be getting hit this hard this late. I thought we’d still just be smoldering. I didn’t know that we would just be a raging fire at this point in time. We’re not prepared for that, but here we are. After this, I’m going to take my kids to a beach or somewhere. — As told to Lyz Lenz

Glenview, Ill. As of , Illinois has seen -- total confirmed cases and -- deaths . Luisa Alog Penepacker, 51 ICU, Glenbrook Hospital (Donte Tatum for The Washington Post) I’ve taken care of a lot of husband-wife patients, unfortunately. One of the cases was one in which the husband had tested positive for covid first, but he was a mild case. She was a little bit more serious. She ended up on our unit. The husband ended up in the hospital the next day, but he was on the step-down unit. When I admitted her, she was terrified, especially knowing that her husband was upstairs in another unit. She was having a hard time breathing, and she grabbed onto my hand and looked at me. She goes, “Am I gonna die?” I mean, I didn’t know what to say. And I just told her, “Not on my watch.” So we just kept on going. But unfortunately, she got intubated the next day. Then I was sent to work upstairs on the step-down unit. I had her husband that next day, and he was actually quite happy that I saw her. He goes, “You took care of my wife, how is she? I heard that she’s not doing well.” I didn’t know what to say to him, either. I just said, “You know, she’s in the best of care. We’ll take really good care of her.” And he looked really relieved. He goes, “I’m just so glad that someone who had seen her is here now to talk to me.” And my heart broke with that. She ended up passing. A few days after, he went home, and I didn’t see him, so I don’t know how he took it. He wasn’t able to see her before she passed. We wear personal air purification respirators on our heads — these big white domes over our heads with a respirator hose going to a machine strapped around our waist, and we look like astronauts walking through the unit, going in and out of patients’ rooms with our plastic gowns and gloves. It can be frightening to family members if they’re allowed to come to visit and definitely for patients because we’re kind of scary-looking. It can be frantic at times. You walk through the hall, and you see a lot of patients on ventilators. You hear a lot of beeping. People are rounding constantly to check on patients. It’s a busy place. You don’t know what to tell family members when you see them. What can you say? You just say, “I’m sorry.” You can’t even hug them. I used to be able to hug family members, but you can’t with all the gear. When patients are scared, I will hold their hand even though I’m wearing gloves. I look them in the eyes as much as I can because really, that’s all you can see. You can’t see our faces. You can barely even hear past the mask. So I’ll make sure to look at them. I try to make an effort to smile with my eyes and to just hold their hand if they need it. — As told to Erin Chan Ding

Murray, Utah As of , Utah has seen -- total confirmed cases and -- deaths . Tammy Kocherhans, 41 Respiratory ICU, Intermountain Healthcare (Kim Raff for The Washington Post) These patients are different than the typical patient. They’re very complex. They can change in the blink of an eye. And it’s very hard as a nurse when you wrap your heart and soul into taking care of these patients. I started noticing that I was emotionally tired. I was physically completely exhausted. And I was beginning to question whether or not I could continue forward being a nurse at all. I was past my physical capacity. I happened to be working a day where another health care worker who was a veteran said that this was like a combat zone, and for some reason in my head, that validated the way that I was feeling. So I reached out to one of my best friends who is a veteran, a flight medic, and he said, “I meditate and do yoga.” Once I started doing that, I was able to handle the emotional crises, the physical pain of working so, so many long, hard hours. We do something called proning, where you take patients and flip them over onto their bellies. And that sounds really easy, but it takes a team of a minimum of five people. It is extremely taxing on your body. It hurts. And I lift weights! The meditation and yoga really has saved my life, my mental capacity, my spiritual capacity, my physical capacity, everything that is required to give to these patients. Hopefully by 8 p.m., I’m out in the parking lot and spend a minute in my car to unload from my day. It’s all about taking a moment to breathe for myself and then going through whatever came up that day that I need to let go of. It depends on how complicated my patient was that day, whether I can let my whole day go or if I have to spend time to go through each piece and work it down to: What did I do right? Did I miss something? Sometimes I just can’t let some details go quickly, and I have to work them down to allow myself to say I did everything that I possibly could for this individual this day, in this time, in this situation. And whatever the outcome was or is, I followed protocol. I did everything that I knew how to do. And it’s going to be OK. I find it very frustrating when I go out and about on my days off and I see people very blatantly not wearing masks or trying to tell me how come they don’t work or telling me that this pandemic isn’t real. I find it completely disrespectful to the work we do to save people’s lives, to have people think that this pandemic isn’t real, to show utter disregard for people around them, not trying to do their part. And I really wish that I could take people on a day with me so that they can see what I see. So that they can feel your feet ache so bad that you wish they’d just fall off, because you’re on that concrete for so many hours. Your back aches because you’re wearing equipment to save your life — so that you can save somebody else’s life. And your head hurts. I’ve never had so many headaches in my life because part of the equipment sits on your head, and after 12 hours, it starts to exert so much pressure that you start to have a headache, and you’re dehydrated. Early in the pandemic, I remember walking into this room, and this young patient was crying and asked me if they were going to die. And I’m a mom of teenagers. For me, that was awful because this patient was all alone, and we as staff were minimizing contact because we didn’t want to get the virus. This patient started physically trembling in the bed. I couldn’t take it anymore, and I went over and just held this patient because that’s what I’d want somebody to do for my children. That was my first patient that I held like that. And there have been many since. — As told to Andrew Becker

Murray, Utah As of , Utah has seen -- total confirmed cases and -- deaths . Nate Smithson, 28 Respiratory ICU, IntermountainHealthcare (Kim Raff for The Washington Post) A few weeks ago, my wife and I were on a date at a restaurant. And in the middle of nowhere, I had this panic attack and went and hid in the bathroom stall for half an hour. I have no idea what brought it on. I just couldn’t handle being there right then, which was weird for me. That’s the first time anything like that has happened. But since then, it’s happened multiple times, where the anxiety and stress is overwhelming, and I can’t handle it. So I have to go and excuse myself for a little bit. Balancing work and life is something that used to seem possible. Now it doesn’t seem like there is any difference between the two. I fall asleep and I dream about my patients. When we got our first covid patient in February in the hospital, in the ICU, we all kind of thought it was a little bit of a joke, to be honest. I had this patient, and he was sitting there with minimal amounts of oxygen in the room just watching TV. He’s like, “I’m fine. I don’t know why everyone’s freaking out about this.” And I thought the same thing. And then a few hours later, he stands to go pee, and I’m looking at his monitor. And it drops down to the low 90s. Ninety-two is about as low as you want to go. And then it starts dropping down lower, to about the 70s. Then it gets down into the 60s and 50s. And that’s dangerous territory. That’s where brain cells start dying and you start having some serious problems. I run into the room. We get him back into bed and throw all the oxygen that we have in the room on him, crank everything up, and he’s not recovering from it. We had to intubate right then and there. And about an hour later, he finally starts recovering a little bit. But at this point, he’s sedated, he’s on the ventilator. Everything is worse. And that’s the first time where it’s like: Oh, crap, this is serious. This is something else. I’ve never seen anything like that before. If a patient’s heart stops or if they stop breathing, we call a code blue, and that’s when the doctor, respiratory therapist, nurses, everybody comes into the room. We start chest compressions or CPR or that kind of stuff. This one patient’s heart is not working. So I call the code blue. We all get in there. We start doing the chest compressions. Five minutes later, we get the patient back. We all go back about our work. Twenty minutes later, same thing happens again. We start doing the chest compressions. We start pushing medications as fast as we can to get the patient back again. The spouse comes into the hospital. I explain: “Just so you know, this is what happened before. It could possibly happen again. If it does, I’m going to need you to step outside of the room.” And as I’m explaining this, sure enough, it happens again. We lose the pulse. We lose the heartbeat. So I ask her to leave the room. Everyone gets in there, and we start going for it. We went for almost two hours: chest compressions, pushing medications, shocking the patient’s heart. The doctor is ultimately the one who makes the decision about when we stop, and they call time of death. But typically in situations like that, where it’s unexpected and sudden, they want to make sure that everybody can go home that night feeling OK about what they did, knowing that they did everything. And after an hour, he stops, turns to the room and asks: Does anyone have a problem with us stopping? I didn’t have a problem, but then as he’s saying that, I look out the window, and the patient’s wife is just watching us. She’s been sitting out there watching us for an hour, and no one’s saying anything. And I ask them to keep going. So we did. We went almost for another hour after that, and we didn’t get the patient back. He ended up dying. But I think for me, that was important — to keep going. Not because we thought we would get them back, but so that his wife would know that we did everything we could. I still go to bed with her face kind of burned into my mind, of just seeing her sitting out there watching us, and that’s what kills me. — As told to Andrew Becker",washingtonpost,"['im', 'seven', 'covid19', 'thats', 'know', 'battle', 'work', 'patients', 'patient', 'care', 'day', 'nurses', 'going', 'room', 'icu']",0

Trying to advocate for saving more during the covid-19 pandemic isn’t an easy sell. For millions of people there’s nothing — or not enough — coming in to save. The last of the covid-related financial relief for the unemployed and federal student loan borrowers is slated to end Dec. 31.

While a crisis isn’t an ideal time to push the savings message, the economic fallout from the coronavirus emphasizes how having an emergency fund can make a difference, says George Barany, director of America Saves.

“We’re certainly not tone deaf to that situation by any means, but it seems like this is an opportunity to support those people who really need to establish emergency savings,” Barany said.

Overall, 1 in 4 adults have had trouble paying their bills since the pandemic outbreak, according to a September survey by the Pew Research Center. One-third of Americans have dipped into savings or retirement accounts to make ends meet, and about 1 in 6 have borrowed money from friends or family or gotten groceries from a food bank, the report said. “These types of experiences continue to be more common among adults with lower incomes, those without a college degree and Black and Hispanic Americans,” Pew said.

Black households have been especially hard hit by the covid economic fallout.

“The outsized challenges that Black Americans are facing are a reflection of the generally diminished economic position and health status that they faced before this crisis,” wrote Bradley Hardy, a nonresident senior fellow for the Brookings Institution, and Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University, in a recent policy paper. “Several pre-covid-19 economic conditions — including lower levels of income and wealth, higher unemployment, and greater levels of food and housing insecurity — leave Black families with fewer buffers to absorb economic shocks.”

In a report scheduled for release next week, the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America (CFA) analyzed the finances and savings of Black households before and during the pandemic. The report not surprisingly found that Black households had less net worth and savings compared with White households. America Saves is a campaign coordinated by CFA to advocate for fee-free savings accounts and automatic savings initiatives by financial institutions and employers.

Here’s something noteworthy in the CFA report: Between 2010 and 2019, the percentage of Black households that saved rose from 39 percent to 47 percent, an increase of 21 percent, according to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances.

CFA notes that the Fed data found many Black households negatively impacted by the Great Recession had begun to make a slow but steady recovery. Although only 35 percent of Black households had retirement accounts, the median assets in those accounts increased 67 percent to $35,000 in 2019 from $20,900 in 2013.

“Black households were better prepared than years earlier to cope with an accompanying recession in which many were fired, furloughed, or had work hours cut,” write Barany and Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at CFA.

With Congress stalled on another stimulus package, people are left to figure out how to meet their expenses without additional government support in an economy still struggling for a comeback.

Having some savings — even a small amount — can help in a crisis. You may not have enough to pay the rent, but you can buy a bag of groceries perhaps. The problem is that only 42 percent of Blacks have a traditional savings account and/or a money market deposit account.

“It’s not easy for people with lower incomes to save, but the current crisis demonstrates how important it is to make it a top priority,” Brobeck said.

America Saves has partnered with the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE), utilizing the Yellow Ribbon Network. This online platform normally serves veterans, active military and their families but has expanded to connect anyone impacted by the pandemic with certified financial counselors and coaches at no cost. To sign up for a virtual session, go to yellowribbonnetwork.org/afcpecovid19.

The best way to save is to do it automatically. Set up direct deposits to a savings account when you get paid. Keep your savings away from your regular household account. I don’t carry the debit card connected to my emergency fund.

“We encourage people, even if it’s $5 per paycheck or $10 per paycheck, to set up an automatic system, because it’s the system that’s key,” Barany said.

Maybe you truly don’t have the ability to save now, and there’s no shame in that. But for those who can, do it now. The pandemic is a harsh reminder for all Americans — but especially Black households — that having an emergency fund is critical in a financial crisis.

Mohammad Ali Salih is a Washington correspondent for Arabic publications in the Middle East. He lives in Fairfax County. I am an almost 80-year-old African with diabetes, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol. I’m a little overweight and underwent a recent heart-stent surgery. My Virginia suburb of D.C. has recently seen rising coronavirus cases.

Recently, within a week, my younger daughter, then my elder daughter and now my wife have tested positive for the virus.

In April, I felt the virus would get me soon, so I wrote a will to my family that partly said: “If the virus attacks me, please stay away from me, alive and dead. We will pray together for the last time, in the driveway, with masks and at the six-feet apart distances. I will drive my car to nearby Fairfax Hospital, report to the Emergency office, and start texting — no emotional phone calls — about my developments. If I die, please make arrangements for my cremation; no funeral, no burial, and no mourning gathering. When the virus disappears, please bury my ashes in a grave in the Muslim section of King David Memorial Garden in Falls Church.”

Now, three members of my family have tested positive.

Two days after spending the night with us, our younger daughter called her mother and told her she had a fever. The mother advised her to take a test, and the test came back positive.

Thanks to the Fairfax County Health Department, we were soon contacted. We answered detailed questions and were given elaborate advice, websites and links and asked to fill out daily online update forms.

Then our other daughter, who lives in nearby Fauquier County, called and said she tested positive. Fortunately, she had not visited us in a month.

Soon, my wife started coughing and feeling sick, and, because of crowded nearby test centers, she had to go to Fauquier County to be tested. It was positive.

My wife and I started the following arrangements: separate bedrooms, separate bathrooms, separate dining areas and separate offices. My wife, a senior nurse at Inova Fairfax Hospital doing office work from home, has the dining room, sits in the family room and uses the adjacent bathroom. I, a correspondent for a Saudi magazine out of London, have the downstairs den and the adjacent basement, with sofas, a television and a bathroom.

We asked the Fairfax Health Department about arrangements in the kitchen and were advised to use it at separate times, wipe countertops and cabinet handles and spray the area. After exchanging text messages about the nightmare of cooking separately, we were told we could use the same pots and pans but separate utensils.

As I spray and wipe, I wonder about my relationship with my wife of 45 years, the mother of our three children: Is she a danger, an enemy, a symbol of death? Sometimes I have visions of the viruses coming out of her nose and mouth, flying all over the house. When I do the daily house spray, I avoid the bedroom where she sleeps, though I am tempted to get closer and spray her while she is sleeping.

It sometimes becomes surreal. My hearing and her distance vision are weak. I have to get close to her when she speaks or when I want to show her something. We can’t talk much or leave the house, so mostly we communicate through texting.

As I threw away one empty spray can after the other, my wife and children complained that I was paranoid about cleaning and used excessive disinfectants.

It was probably a combination of excitement, puzzlement and naivete of someone who was born and grew up in a village on the Nile River in northern Sudan, about 6,000 miles away.

Whenever I check WhatsApp’s small group of my villagers, I feel I am more worried about them than they are. Recently, there was a video of my brother’s daughter’s wedding. I didn’t see one single mask, and people were hugging and kissing during a very happy singing and dancing event. They seem resigned to the fact that no vaccine will reach them soon. To protect themselves, they resort to the native medicines of herbs, spices, weeds and plants that I still remember after all these years.

(My father was the village’s shaman and used Prophetic medicine, in reference to the practices of Prophet Muhammad).

Following the villagers’ group suggestions, I tried the three-step “Water Cure”: First, boil very salty water in a pot, bend over and smell deeply so the vapor goes down your nostrils. Second, put some water in a cup, add a little cold water and gurgle to clean your throat. Third, dip your fingers in the water and rub your neck. More important, when you start, say “Bismillah” (by the name of God), and when you finish, say “Alhamdulillah” (thanks to God).

Back home, I panicked when I found that our stock of sprays and wipes was running out, and learned that nearby stores had none. I called my children for help and panicked more when I checked Amazon and found it was out of stock of my favorite.

Will I be protected until I receive the supplies? Will I be alive until I get my vaccine shots?

Trying to be positive, I am now dreaming of two coming days: the first, hopefully in February, when I will drive my car to the nearby Safeway or CVS and get vaccine shots. The second, in late April, when, with hope, we can return to our family’s 20-year-old tradition of almost annual Caribbean cruises on what will be the first day of my wife’s retirement.

How TV shows are integrating covid-19 into their storylines

As a pioneering psychological profiler for the Central Intelligence Agency and later as a consultant, Jerrold M. Post plumbed the lives, leadership styles and, at times, the mental illness of foreign heads around the globe. Over decades, his expertise and instincts were greatly in demand, especially at the White House. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight The Yale- and Harvard-trained psychiatrist advised former president Jimmy Carter about how best to negotiate with Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat before the Camp David Peace Accords. He explained Sadat’s “Nobel Prize Complex” — his desire to be remembered as a great leader — and Begin’s biblical preoccupation and obsession with detail.

Post warned about labeling Saddam Hussein simply as “the mad man of the Middle East,” lest it mislead political leaders into thinking Hussein was unpredictable, when in fact he was not. As an expert in the psychology of terrorism, Post produced psychological profiles of suicide bombers in Israel and opined on the corporate leadership style of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

And yet in late 2019 — a year before his death on Nov. 22 of covid-19 at the age of 86 — Post found himself doing what at one point would have been unthinkable: publishing a book about the alarming psychological makeup of an American president.

In writing “Dangerous Charisma: The Political Psychology of Donald Trump and His Followers,” Post risked violating the American Psychiatric Association’s “Goldwater Rule,” which forbids the diagnosis of public figures without full evaluation and consent.

“He was a Life Fellow of the APA, but he said if they kicked him out, he didn’t care,” said his wife, Carolyn Post. “He felt it was that important and that psychiatrists have a duty to warn.”

By then, Post had had a storied two-decade career as founding director of the CIA’s Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior. He then used his expertise to found Political Psychology Associates, a research and consulting firm that specialized in industrial espionage, counterterrorism and leadership assessment. All along, he lectured as a professor at George Washington University, wrote 14 books and continued to see patients in a private practice he ran out of the basement of his Bethesda home.

His career success, his family said, was a reflection of an insatiable, roving curiosity and a probing empathy for his fellow humans — qualities that also made him a highly engaging friend and a nurturing husband, father and doctor.

He devoured books about politics and history, with a penchant for biographies by Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough. He traveled the world with his family and — always drawn to the human — took lovely candid photographs of people off the beaten path that won national awards, his family said. He did not hang back as tourists tend to, but engaged people in his humble way about their lives. On a trip to Mexico with his daughter Cindy Post he drove off the main road, where he came upon some male villagers playing a board game near a cliff overlooking the ocean. He gestured to join them, they offered drinks, and he snapped away.

“He always wanted to know, what are the people about and what is their world?” said Cindy, 58, a clinical psychologist in Silver Spring. Her father “was kind of a whirling dervish. . . . He was the kind of person who would think, ‘There are 24 hours in a day. Can we fill 23 of them?”

He zipped from place to place in his beloved convertible sports cars — a favorite was a green Austin-Healey — with a signature driving cap atop his head.

Post was born in 1934 in New Haven, Conn. His father sold movies to theaters and his mother worked as a bookkeeper, taught painting, and made and sold pottery. He put himself through nearby Yale University for his undergraduate degree and then medical school. He received his postgraduate psychiatric training at Harvard Medical School and the National Institute of Mental Health.

He was an accomplished improvisational jazz pianist who could also play almost any tune by ear, his family said. For anniversaries, birthdays and other special occasions, he would write new lyrics for Gilbert and Sullivan show tunes and, with Carolyn, serenade friends and relatives.

He was witty, too, and loved word play. Post was a member of a lunch group of GWU professors dubbed IOTA, which stood for the International Order of Twisted Aphorisms. Members would write puns and aphorisms to bring to the meetings. When a nurse asked him before the recent election who the president was — standard practice with elderly patients — he replied sardonically: “Unfortunately, we don’t have one at the moment.”

Post was a fiercely competitive backgammon player — and schooled his daughter Meredith Gramlich from childhood on the fine points of the game on a custom hand-carved board from Israel. In the twilight of his life, he reassured 52-year-old Gramlich proudly, “I never threw a game for you.”

He was also a faithful father to daughter Kirsten Davidson, 49, who is blind and intellectually disabled, greeting her in a special way every morning and signing off to her each night.

At the CIA, Post was able to marry his triple passions of psychiatry, history and politics by founding the agency’s Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior. The work of the center, an interdisciplinary behavioral sciences unit that assessed foreign leaders for the president and other senior officials, was groundbreaking, said Nicholas Dujmovic, a longtime CIA historian who retired from the agency in 2016 and is now an assistant professor of politics at Catholic University of America.

“Post made it obvious through his work that we need to have professionals involved in assessing the health and psychology of foreign leaders,” said Dujmovic, who as an editor of the president’s daily briefings at the CIA said he frequently encountered Post’s “legacy” in briefing contributions.

He said he was surprised to learn that among Post’s many honors — including the Intelligence Medal of Merit in 1979 after his role in the Camp David Accords — he is not listed as one of the CIA “Trailblazers,” who made a significant impact on the agency’s history. He believes that could be due to “snobbery” within the agency during Post’s time there that distrusted the practice of psychological analysis, especially when conducted from afar.

President Carter contradicted that notion, Dujmovic noted, openly crediting the role of Post’s team in the success of the historic peace agreement. Carter “basically said ‘I spent two weeks with these men and I wouldn’t change a word of [Post’s] assessments,’ ” Dujmovic said.

In his last effort to psychologically profile a leader, Post trained his expertise on Donald Trump. In “Dangerous Charisma,” co-authored with Stephanie Doucette, Post described Trump as a destructive charismatic leader with the traits of a classic narcissist — such as grandiosity, lack of empathy, hypersensitivity to criticism and no constraints of conscience. But Post also probed Trump’s symbiotic relationship with his followers, and theirs with him.

“The dangerous, destructive charismatic leader polarizes and identifies an outside enemy and pulls his followers together by manipulating their common feelings of victimization,” Post said in a December 2019 interview.

Were he to lose the election, Post said a year ago, “I think we can be assured that he will not concede early. Trump may not even recognize the legitimacy of the election.”

After the book’s publication, Post’s health took a downward turn. His kidneys had already been failing, forcing him to go for dialysis several times a week, when he suffered a stroke in July. After several months in a rehabilitation facility, Post spent his final weeks of life surrounded by family at home. On Sunday Nov. 15, he began having trouble breathing. Carolyn called 911 and an ambulance rushed him to the hospital, where he tested positive for the coronavirus. He died exactly one week later.

Visiting with her father in his waning days, Cindy Post said, she tried to help him consider the fullness of his restless life and find peace with the end.

“How do you feel about the life you had,” she asked him. “You’ve done a lot of things, you know.”

“There’s so much more to do,” Post replied.

“But can you let this be enough?” his daughter asked.

He didn’t answer, but Cindy said she could see the frustration written on her father’s face.

After his 81-year-old father died of the coronavirus on Tuesday following nearly a week of isolation at a nursing home, Courtney Farr could not contain his frustration with the attitudes of people in his rural Kansas hometown who have downplayed the severity of the pandemic and railed against wearing masks for months.

So when it was time to write the obituary for his father, Marvin James Farr, the son slammed those in Scott City, Kan., who refuse to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus that killed his dad and more than 275,000 other Americans.

“He was born into an America recovering from the Great Depression and about to face World War 2, times of loss and sacrifice difficult for most of us to imagine,” the obituary said. “He died in a world where many of his fellow Americans refuse to wear a piece of cloth on their face to protect one another.”

Farr’s father died after six days in isolation inside the Park Lane Nursing Home. In the obituary, Farr described the days his father spent struggling with the virus without the comfort of familiar faces.

“He died in a room not his own, being cared for by people dressed in confusing and frightening ways,” the obituary said. “He died with covid-19, and his final days were harder, scarier and lonelier than necessary. He was not surrounded by friends and family.”

The emotional obituary began to spread widely on social media this week after Farr posted it on Facebook and the Kansas City Star reported it on Thursday. The memorial joins the ranks of several other obituaries for covid-19 victims to criticize people, including elected officials, for failing to take the pandemic seriously enough.

Like many towns in the rural Midwest, Scott City, Kan., has remained distant from the worst coronavirus hot spots, with its surrounding county reporting 374 coronavirus cases and five deaths. But now, the coronavirus has spread beyond densely populated cities to much smaller communities.

Farr said local anti-mask sentiments have made it even more difficult to bear the loss of his father. “I’ve spent most of this year hearing people from my hometown talk about how this disease isn’t real, isn’t that bad, only kills old people, masks don’t work,” he said Wednesday on Facebook. “And because of the prevalence of those attitudes, my father’s death was so much harder on him, his family and his caregivers than it should have been.”

Marvin James Farr was born May 23, 1939, in Modoc, Kan. He graduated from Kansas State University in 1968. Following an interest in science, he considered studying to be a mortician, but decided instead to work as a farmer and veterinarian in a small town in western Kansas, his obituary said.

“The science that guided his professional life has been disparaged and abandoned by so many of the same people who depended on his knowledge to care for their animals and to raise their food,” his son wrote.

Courtney Farr said he was comforted by all of the people who shared the obituary and shared their own experiences with the pandemic.

“Often when we experience loss, pain or trauma, we feel so alone,” he wrote on Facebook on Thursday. “And there’s such incredible power to learning that you are not, that someone else also knows.”

A small number of people who read the obituary chafed at the political message Farr included in the tribute to his dad. Farr said that message was “perfectly reflective of our relationship, something that a stranger would never understand.”

Farr said he and his father loved to talk politics together, and they often disagreed. They would spend road trips arguing over the news. The rest of the family sometimes balked at their squabbles, which Farr said drove their relatives “justifiably nuts.” Their wives even banned the men from talking politics in the car if they were all riding together. But Marvin Farr always enjoyed their debates, his son said Thursday on Facebook.

“For me, there’s an extra layer to his obituary,” Farr said. “That it is political and that it will cause debate is fitting, it demonstrates the relationship between its subject and author.”

It takes lives and businesses, milestones and traditions. Covid-19 also devours golden opportunities. Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount have been at it for decades, making music in coffeehouses, D.C. gyms and stages and music festivals — small gigs that got bigger, moments of despair that turned into songs. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight And 2020 was going to be it — the big one. They performed at the Grammys in January. Rolling Stone magazine called their band, the War and Treaty, “one of Nashville’s most thrilling new acts.”

They played with Emmylou Harris, toured with Al Green, shared stages with Brandi Carlile and Elvis Costello, became close to John Prine and were set to headline the prestigious blues tent at the Jazz & Heritage Festival in New Orleans in the spring.

On March 12, as the pandemic was in its fledgling days, they played a huge event in New York. The gig ended with four of the people onstage infected with the coronavirus, including 43-year-old Blount.

Her lungs! That voice that sang alongside Patti LaBelle and Lauryn Hill, the one that gets critics to consistently call her “underrated,” was subdued as she strained to breathe.

“It was scary,” Blount said. “I didn’t have to be on a ventilator, but I was having trouble breathing.”

From March to June, they watched their concerts, events and appearances evaporate, all while Blount was in a feverish fight for her life.

They’re not despairing, though. These two have been knocked down before. Their whole story — why their lives were so bad and their music so good — is about getting back up.

The seeds of Trotter’s success story were planted 25 years ago, when the bus from Ohio pulled into that rough old bus station in D.C. and announced his arrival with a pneumatic exhale.

He was 13, and he and his mom landed in the nation’s capital because that’s the farthest her secret stash of dollar bills could get them when she finally made the break from his alcoholic, abusive father. The shelter that took them in — even though he was over the age limit — saved their lives.

Trotter, now 38, didn’t find the music that led him to Blount by taking lessons from an inspirational teacher or the band director at a school. That’s not the life of a kid who grew up in a D.C. shelter for battered women.

No, he found it in one of Saddam Hussein’s Baghdad palaces in 2004, where the rubble and carnage of the early years of America’s war on terror took a toll on Trotter’s mind.

He was in the Army stationed in that palace, when his commanding officer told him about the darndest thing: “You won’t believe this, Trotter. Saddam Hussein’s piano is in the basement.”

Trotter checked it out, crawling over rubble and through soot to find it — and there it was, perfectly tuned and unharmed: a dictator’s piano. He put his fingers on the keys and something clicked.

So he played and played, figuring out how the black and white keys worked together, coming up with riffs and hooks, and he began adding words — some about the war and the people killed.

He had a tune that he wanted to share with that commanding officer, the one who directed him to the piano. The officer was headed out and told him he would listen to it when he got back. Because Trotter’s life is filled with cinematic moments, that officer never had a chance to return.

Trotter wrote and performed a moving piece about him for the officer’s memorial. The Army saw the value of the tribute, and the impact that performance had on the unit, so they made that his mission — learning about soldiers who were killed and performing musical obituaries.

When Trotter returned to D.C., to the wife and child he left behind when he went to war, he began playing and performing, mostly small gigs unfurling those painful tributes to killed service members — coffeehouse obituaries that were, unwittingly, the start of his public PTSD therapy. He and his wife divorced.

Then he met Tanya Blount at an event in Maryland. A talented musician who had a small part in “Sister Act 2” and big parts on studio albums, Blount, like Trotter, was a divorced parent and abuse survivor. Both said they had no intention of marrying.

They got married.

I met them in a high school gym in D.C. on Valentine’s Day five years ago, when they performed a private show for the women and children who were living at Trotter’s teenage home, the House of Ruth.

I talked to them about juggling their blended family of children from their past marriages plus Legend, the toddler son they had together, trying to fit performances in between all the family noise and activities. And I wished them well, not envying the uphill battle they were undertaking in a ruthless industry that probably cared little for sitter issues or parent-teacher conferences.

Two years later, they had another reckoning.

They were struggling — financially, musically, as parents — y’all know that feeling of overwhelm. Trotter also had those days in Baghdad inside his head. The PTSD was eating away at him and he was planning to kill himself. Blount got down in front of him and said “just give me five more minutes to love you,” and that was enough time for help to arrive.

That turned into “Five More Minutes,” a song on their second album that a Rolling Stone critic described as an “up-tempo roots-rocker with an opening horn riff that conjures early Seventies Hi Records gold.”

I caught up with them from their home in Nashville, hearing about the wild ride they’ve been on since we met at that gym in D.C.

There was the meteoric rise — playing with Harris and brought onstage at the Grand Ole Opry by Prine — asked to play the big festivals at Bonnaroo, Telluride and New Orleans.

And then it halted.

“We lost all our gigs. Just gone,” Blount said. “Legend, he’s 9 now, he’s been traveling on the road with us, home schooling. But what the pandemic has done is taught us to appreciate our home. We bought the house, our first house.”

Trotter interjected: “I’m standing here! I has a swimming pool, and thinking about leaving home in Cleveland all those years ago. We did it. We did it on our own.”

This cursed year has started to release its grasp on them. Blount’s lungs have healed. They released their second album, “Hearts Town,” and they sang on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” in September.

They picked “Five More Minutes,” a song that’s about them, but really about America — coming back and standing up again, especially when you’re down.

With few options left, overwhelmed doctors and other caregivers are appealing directly to governors for relief from the staggering increases in hospitalized covid-19 patients as the virus surges across the country. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In Connecticut, Tennessee, Missouri and Mississippi, physicians have issued unusually public pleas for stronger responses to the pandemic as hospitals and their staffs near a breaking point. The number of hospitalized covid-19 patients surpassed 100,000 on Wednesday, placing enormous strain on the nation’s acute care hospitals, where there are roughly 730,000 beds.

The efforts have achieved little in the way of tangible relief so far, and in one case drew a rebuke from Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R).

Without a new relief package from Washington, governors have adopted a variety of approaches to grapple with the runaway virus while trying to keep parts of their economies alive. That includes allowing some businesses, such as restaurants and gyms, to remain open with limited capacity and other restrictions.

The largest organized effort by health-care providers may be in Connecticut, where dozens of doctors wrote Gov. Ned Lamont (D), asking him to halt indoor dining, close gyms and ban “all other unnecessary public gatherings.” Nearly 700 people signed an online version of the letter, adding comments that illustrate their frustration and fear about the unrelenting flow of patients into the state’s hospitals.

“We are prepared to do whatever we can to care for, comfort, and heal all those that we can, but we want everyone outside to know what we are up against, and not to assume that our capacity is limitless,” the Nov. 24 letter to Lamont said.

Under “reasons for signing,” people who identified themselves by name as doctors, nurses and others added comments such as, “I wish as many of my patients and colleagues survive to 2021 as possible,” and “I’m a critical care nurse and we are running out of room! Please help us.”

Naftali Kaminski, chief of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, who signed the original letter, said in an interview that “you can keep pumping the water but someone needs to close the levees. It’s a little bit of a Katrina feeling.”

In Connecticut, restaurants are allowed to be open at 50 percent of capacity, with a maximum of eight people per table, and must close indoor dining by 10 p.m. Users of gyms and fitness centers must wear masks at all times. Fitness classes are limited to 25 percent of capacity.

Lamont met virtually Tuesday with some of the letter writers to hear their frustrations and promised to continue talking, said Max Reiss, his director of communications.

“The governor has already scaled back the reopening of the state with additional recent steps to enhance enforcement of public health rules,” Reiss said in a statement. “Those steps are consistent with the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who has said to keep bars closed and work to keep schools open — moves Connecticut has made.” Fauci is the nation’s top infectious-disease specialist and a member of President Trump’s coronavirus task force.

The Connecticut doctors have fared better than colleagues in Mississippi, where Reeves on Tuesday rejected a call to reinstitute a statewide mask mandate. That Nov. 24 plea came from four medical leaders, including LouAnn Woodward, vice-chancellor of the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and Claude Brunson, executive director of the Mississippi State Medical Association.

Reeves imposed a statewide mask mandate in August, but lifted it in late September when cases were declining. The letter said “the statewide mask mandate, which was highly effective, needs to be reinstituted.”

But Reeves now favors a county-by-county mandate approach and encouraging residents to wear masks. On Tuesday, he added 13 counties to the mandate, raising the number to 54 of the state’s 82 counties. At a media briefing Tuesday, he added, “I almost feel like there are those out there who really, truly believe if I were to write an executive order, a statewide prohibition against hurricanes in 2021, that we won’t have any hurricanes. It just doesn’t work that way.”

Reeves’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Earlier last month, doctors in Tennessee pleaded with Gov. Bill Lee (R) to issue a statewide mask order and two days ago, a St. Louis-area physician started a petition asking Missouri Gov. Mike Parson (R) to do the same.

“We’re drowning at the hospital,” Micah Luderer told local media. “People are dying every day from covid-19, and we’re not doing everything in our power to stop the virus.”

John R. Spurzem, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said some doctors may take up Woodward’s call for a mask mandate, though he expressed discouragement at Reeves’s response to the first request.

Woodward wrote on Twitter Wednesday that “as of 6:46 am today, UMMC’s bed status is -31 beds, which means that 31 people are admitted but waiting for a bed to become available. Who will be #32 or #33 or #34?”

“Those of us in health care are numb, frustrated and so very tired,” she added in another tweet.

Spurzem said the hospital is “not swamped like some of the places in the Upper Midwest that we’ve been reading about,” but “our numbers have doubled and tripled just in the last month. So we’re starting to surge again. And we better do some thing sooner or later.”

Joe Biden and Kamala D. Harris won’t be sworn in as president and vice president for 49 more days, but there is something powerful they can do before that to combat the covid-19 pandemic. As soon as the Food and Drug Administration approves a coronavirus vaccine, Biden and Harris should take their doses.

And they should do it live on national television.

As much as people are desperate for the pandemic to end, public trust in the forthcoming vaccines has fluctuated significantly in recent months. In particular, Black Americans, wary of a medical system that has sometimes abused them and continues to provide them with lower-quality care, are highly skeptical.

Biden and Harris can use their inoculations to take the public inside the vaccine development and delivery process and, in doing so, build confidence in an unprecedented scientific accomplishment. Such a concrete demonstration of the vaccines could also help Americans recommit to the public health measures that will be a bridge between our current disaster and the new normal we all hope will be here soon.

Advertisement

During the campaign, Biden and Harris walked an uneasy line when they talked about the integrity of vaccine candidates. Both indicated that they would trust scientists over President Trump about the safety of any new vaccine, even as Harris suggested that the administration was interfering with experts’ abilities to speak freely.

Whether that messaging contributed to concerns about a coronavirus vaccine among Democrats is hard to measure. But there would be no better way for Biden and Harris to clear up any residual ambiguity about their confidence in the approval process than to take a vaccine themselves.

In fact, such public vaccine demonstrations have a long history.

Follow Alyssa Rosenberg 's opinions Follow

Weill Cornell Medical College professor Kendall Smith noted that in 1881, at the behest of veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol, groundbreaking biologist Louis Pasteur performed a public test of an anthrax vaccine for sheep before an audience of at least 200 “government officials, local politicians, veterinarians, farmers, agriculturists, cavalry officers and newspaper reporters.”

Jonas Salk gave an early version of his polio vaccine to his own children, and the March of Dimes campaign against the disease photographed him delivering their second doses as part of a national publicity campaign. Maurice Hilleman, who developed a mumps vaccine by isolating virus from his oldest daughter, had his younger daughter photographed while being inoculated.

On Edward R. Murrow’s “See It Now,” Salk gave viewers what historian David Oshinsky described as “an ‘on-camera demonstration’ of monkey kidney tissue being ground up like malt powder in a Waring blender” in an effort to make clear how the vaccine was produced. Elvis Presley even got vaccinated for polio before an appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” with New York City Health Commissioner Leona Baumgartner holding his arm steady for the shot.

A public vaccination campaign featuring Biden and Harris would be “a great idea,” says Paul Offit, who runs the Vaccine Education Center and is an attending physician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia — especially if such a program included figures who might appeal to audiences across political and cultural spectrums. Former president Barack Obama might be on board for such an effort: In a Wednesday interview, he said, “I will be taking [a vaccine] and I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed just so people know I trust this science.”

Administering the shots live could help counter conspiracy theories about whether Biden and Harris had actually taken the vaccine. And done right, building specials around each shot of the two-dose sequence could make the vaccines more familiar.

As Offit writes in his book “The Cutter Incident,” a 1954 Gallup poll revealed that “more Americans knew about the field trial of Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine than knew the full name of the president of the United States.” That isn’t true with the coronavirus vaccines. Even well-informed readers are likely to have questions about the leading candidates and what it’s like to receive one.

Pfizer’s drug, for example, needs to be stored at exceptionally cold temperatures. So, will the inoculation feel cold? Pfizer and Moderna reported that participants in their trials experienced only minimal side effects; Biden and Harris could tell viewers whether they felt sore or queasy after their first shots. These broadcasts could also include the scientists involved in vaccine development and the doctors who administered the vaccines fielding questions submitted by members of the public.

And Biden and Harris could also talk about what it feels like to cautiously set down the burden of fear that so many Americans have carried for almost a year. Even with a highly effective vaccine, it may be hard for many to unlearn the impulse to shy away from neighbors or to shed the anxiety that comes with walking into a store.

This new future is going to feel strange. By leading the way even before they’ve taken power, Biden and Harris can help us to grapple with that, all while making make the case that it’s worth a few more months of patience and loneliness to get there.

Symptoms of covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, can range from mild to severe. The most common include fever, a dry cough or shortness of breath, but there are other indications you could need to be tested or have a conversation with your doctor. Not everyone experiences the same symptoms, and the order in which they appear can vary. Some people don’t show any symptoms — what health experts call “asymptomatic” cases — but still could spread the virus to others.

Although this list is not inclusive of every possible symptom, it includes what physicians and health experts have determined are the most common. Some of these symptoms will coincide with one another. Symptoms of a coronavirus infection can emerge anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.

Fever, cough or shortness of breath

Fever, cough or shortness of breath are the highest-frequency symptoms of covid-19. According to a study of symptoms in about 11,000 adult covid-19 patients, at least one of these symptoms was reported in 93 percent of cases.

Fever or chills

A fever might be the first indication you have a covid-19 infection, according to a recent study that looked at the onset of symptoms.

The fever itself can range from low-grade — maybe only a degree or two higher than normal — to dangerously high. A fever higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheit is considered very high in adults and is a sign of a severe infection.

You can experience chills in which your body feels cold for no apparent reason. It might be a cozy temperature, but you’re still shivering. Chills are most common with a fever, or when a fever is coming on, but they don’t always coincide with fever.

Cough

The coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so cough is a common symptom, and it can also appear early in the infection. A dry, persistent cough can be a red flag that you have covid-19.

Shortness of breath

Along with the cough can come shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Covid-19 can sometimes cause pneumonia, according to Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins.

Pneumonia occurs when “air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms,” Galiatsatos writes.

Shortness of breath caused by covid-19 can be mild or severe enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen or a ventilator.

Fatigue or muscle aches

Sometimes the only indication that you might have of a viral infection is a general sickly feeling, or what physicians call fatigue — a persistent exhaustion that isn’t solved by getting more sleep.

In extreme cases, people who have suffered from covid-19 describe having barely enough energy to walk to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for a glass of water.

Some people report muscle aches or general achiness for no other apparent reason.

Fatigue and aches have also been reported by so-called covid-19 “long-haulers,” who continue to experience symptoms of the illness for weeks or months after becoming infected.

Headache

Headache is the most common neurological symptom in covid-19.

Other less-common neurological symptoms could include muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures and stroke, according to Harvard Medical School.

Loss or distorted sense of smell or taste

The loss of smell or taste is typically linked to early symptoms of upper-respiratory infections — including previous coronavirus strains — because the virus damages olfactory bulbs that are involved in the sense of smell.

It appears to be more common for people who have covid-19, and it’s possible to lose your sense of smell or taste while experiencing no other symptoms.

Another possible symptom is a distorted sense of smell or taste.

Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Smell and Taste Center, told The Washington Post that certain distortions, including one that causes everything to have a fecal-like odor, can make common food and drinks revolting, because flavor is tied to sense of smell. “Even water can become unpleasant,” he said.

The distortions are most common in people who are recovering from covid-19 and starting to get their smell back, according to Justin Turner, medical director of Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Smell and Taste Center.

Sore throat, congestion or runny nose

A sore throat, congestion or runny nose are less frequently associated with covid-19, but they still occur in enough cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added them to its list.

A runny nose was reported by about 7 percent of adult patients in the study of symptom frequency, while a sore throat was reported by 35 percent.

It can be difficult to determine whether these symptoms are a result of covid-19 or something more benign, such as allergies.

But allergies, which are an overreaction of the immune system to foreign particles, would not trigger things such as a fever, muscle aches or chills, according to Sally Joo Bailey, an allergist at Allergy Associates of Northern Virginia in Arlington. Those are the classic signs of a viral infection, such as covid-19.

Stomach issues

Studies have found that about half of coronavirus patients experience at least one gastrointestinal symptom, which can include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort.

In the study of symptom frequency, diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal-related symptom in adults, and abdominal pain was the least common.

Difference between covid-19 and the flu

The potential winter surge of coronavirus infections could coincide with another major public health event: the seasonal flu. Here's what you need to know. (Video: The Washington Post)

A key difference is the transmissivity: The coronavirus spreads more easily than the flu. Public health officials have encouraged everyone to get vaccinated against the flu this year to help ward off a bad flu season superimposed on a pandemic — and having had a flu shot could also help rule it out if you start to experience any of these symptoms.

Ultimately, infectious-disease doctors say most people won’t be able to tell which illness they have. Common warning signs for both include fever, cough, chills and shortness of breath.

The one symptom that’s common with covid-19, but not with the flu, is loss of taste and smell. But not everyone with covid-19 experiences that symptom, and experts warned that someone with allergies or a cold might also struggle to smell because they have a stuffy nose.

Absent a loss of taste or smell, most patients will need a nasal swab to get a proper diagnosis.

Those conclusions contrast sharply with the prevailing wisdom in the United States, where public health officials have focused on low rates of positive coronavirus tests in the broader community as a prerequisite for in-person schooling. Some U.S. school districts recently announced that they are going remote again, as coronavirus cases rise, and other districts have yet to reopen their classrooms at all.

“It is still difficult for me to understand why schools are closed in the United States,” said Otto Helve, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare who has studied coronavirus transmission in schools. “Schools are not driving the epidemic.”

Though cases among students and teachers have risen along with overall viral levels in their communities, the rate at which the virus has been passed on within classrooms has stayed low and constant — unlike universities, which have emerged as a concern.

In Finland, 20,000 of about 1.2 million students and teachers this school year have been asked to quarantine because of possible in-school exposure, Helve said. But just 1 percent of that group — about 200 people — has gone on to exhibit any coronavirus symptoms and then tested positive. Not everyone without symptoms gets tested, but based on those who have, another 1 percent of these people probably have ­asymptomatic cases of the virus, Helve said.

Skeptics say schools aren’t ­doing enough testing to have a true sense of how much the virus is spreading. But communities with enough resources to conduct broader testing after possible exposure haven’t typically found many asymptomatic cases hiding among teachers and students. And because most European schools have embraced bubbles, where students and teachers mix only with their class and no one else, thorough contact tracing can be done in schools even when it falters in wider society.

“We are not seeing the tip of the iceberg; we are seeing the whole iceberg because of our good tracing,” said Quique Bassat, a Spanish pediatrician and epidemiologist who was the coordinator of the Spanish Pediatrics Association’s working group for school reopenings.

In Spain, coronavirus cases were already rising sharply across the country in early September, as classrooms prepared to reopen for the first time since the pandemic hit.

“There were legitimate concerns that perhaps we were fueling the epidemic, and perhaps we were adding more fuel to the fire, and this was going to be the apocalypse,” Bassat said. “To the surprise of many, reopening the schools, applying all these measures in a strict way, controlled transmission, and there were no big outbreaks.”

In Bassat’s region, Catalonia, 87 percent of initial cases in classrooms did not spread to another person. And among the 13 percent that did, the “vast majority” spread to only two or three other people in the school, he said.

The virus’s onward spread was limited even though Spain’s positive coronavirus test rate — 13 percent at its peak in early November, and 10 percent now — is far higher than the level that many U.S. school districts have said is acceptable for in-person schooling. New York City closed its schools last month after 3 percent of city tests came back positive, then reversed itself and made plans to resume classes for the youngest grades.

Most Spanish schools have continued without interruption for the youngest age groups, up to about 12. In Spain and elsewhere, high schools have been more likely than younger grades to switch to part-time or full-time remote education, since risks of infection and transmission appear higher among teenagers than among younger children.

France, which spiked worse than Spain last month, also saw relatively low numbers in schools. The week of France’s peak last month, 0.1 percent of students and 0.2 percent of school personnel tested positive for the coronavirus. Across the country, 142 of 528,400 classrooms quarantined, about 0.03 percent, while 21 of 61,500 schools went into fuller quarantine, according to data from the education ministry.

Rising infection levels among German children have sparked nervousness there, but public health experts say that partly reflects a more relaxed approach to safety measures. People between the ages of 15 and 19 have been among the most-infected in Germany in recent weeks, and cases among them tripled between mid-October and their peak in mid-November — faster than those among the population at large, which doubled. Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for stricter mask-wearing and smaller class sizes, but those decisions are left up to individual states.

Overall, while some parents and teachers unions continue to have concerns, many European societies are broadly behind efforts to keep students in their classrooms. Advocates of in-person school say the cost of virtual classrooms for vulnerable students is steep, as is the economic toll of taking parents out of the workforce because their young children are at home.

“It’s not that we think schools are no danger, that there’s no effect,” said Steven Van Gucht, the head of viral diseases at the Belgian public health agency. “Schools are the last thing to close; they’re really the last thing on the list. There is political pressure and societal pressure. We consider schooling an absolute priority.”

Austria, the Czech Republic and Italy have been exceptions within Europe, opting for widespread school shutdowns or restricted reopenings amid outbreaks. In Italy, that decision sparked protests from students, who in several cities donned hats and gloves and sat with their laptops outside their school buildings, saying they have a right to in-person education.

Pandemic measures are significantly less polarized in Europe than they are in the United States, where President Trump has contradicted his own scientific advisers and made reopening society a political loyalty test, sparking backlash among his opponents. Teachers unions, which have emerged as a powerful force of opposition to school reopenings in the United States, have generally been more acquiescent in Europe, pushing for safety measures rather than closures.

And European societies have generally been willing to make sacrifices to keep schools open, such as banning indoor dining or channeling money for safety measures that in some countries are estimated to cost about $12,000 a month for a school of 1,000 students.

Cristina Trujillo’s English-

instruction classroom in the southern Spanish city of Seville now has a carbon dioxide monitor to keep watch over how much exhaled air is building up. Some rooms have had new windows cut into them so that air can flow in from two sides. The school, Colegio Santo Ángel de la Guarda, bought N95 masks for its teachers. Then, when their voices became too muffled, it bought them microphones. They’ll get voice lessons next month to project better. Because students can’t leave books in their classroom overnight anymore — that would get in the way of the thorough disinfection — their load has been lightened by doing work on Chromebooks that the school purchased for the pandemic. The school’s technology coordinator now devotes most of his time to keeping everyone safe: checking carbon dioxide levels, overseeing renovations, buying masks and hand gel.

Keeping the virus in check is “easier in school,” Trujillo said. “Here, the environment is under control.”

As cases mounted across Spain, to levels that at their Nov. 4 peak were comparable to those in the United States, not a single case spread inside the school, officials said. Two teachers and 11 students brought cases into classrooms from outside, but none infected anyone else.

Bassat said he worried less about the risk from in-person education and more about what happens when the country’s 8 million students get a break from it. Spain has three-week winter holidays, and children will stay at home or mix with family and friends. The transition from a controlled to an uncontrolled environment could be perilous, he said.

Policymakers across Europe say students can and do infect one another. Sometimes they bring cases home and infect their families. But even in societies where cases have been off-the-charts, as was the case for Belgium in October, public health officials say they believe cases in schools reflected viral growth in society at large but weren’t a driver of it. One indicator: Incidence of the virus among teachers and students never exceeded that of the country at large.

When Belgium buckled under a second wave in which daily cases peaked at 1,536 per million people — more than three times the level in the United States right now — it doubled a preplanned post-Halloween school vacation to two weeks, creating a 14-day circuit breaker that built on a broad, nationwide lockdown. Afterward, schools resumed, and infections have dropped for weeks.

“It is very clear to everyone what the downsides are to having school closures,” Helve said. “The downside to closing would need to be compensated by an extremely good outcome in terms of disease control, and it doesn’t seem to do that.”

Trying to advocate for saving more during the covid-19 pandemic isn’t an easy sell. For millions of people there’s nothing — or not enough — coming in to save. The last of the covid-related financial relief for the unemployed and federal student loan borrowers is slated to end Dec. 31.

While a crisis isn’t an ideal time to push the savings message, the economic fallout from the coronavirus emphasizes how having an emergency fund can make a difference, says George Barany, director of America Saves.

“We’re certainly not tone deaf to that situation by any means, but it seems like this is an opportunity to support those people who really need to establish emergency savings,” Barany said.

Overall, 1 in 4 adults have had trouble paying their bills since the pandemic outbreak, according to a September survey by the Pew Research Center. One-third of Americans have dipped into savings or retirement accounts to make ends meet, and about 1 in 6 have borrowed money from friends or family or gotten groceries from a food bank, the report said. “These types of experiences continue to be more common among adults with lower incomes, those without a college degree and Black and Hispanic Americans,” Pew said.

Black households have been especially hard hit by the covid economic fallout.

“The outsized challenges that Black Americans are facing are a reflection of the generally diminished economic position and health status that they faced before this crisis,” wrote Bradley Hardy, a nonresident senior fellow for the Brookings Institution, and Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University, in a recent policy paper. “Several pre-covid-19 economic conditions — including lower levels of income and wealth, higher unemployment, and greater levels of food and housing insecurity — leave Black families with fewer buffers to absorb economic shocks.”

In a report scheduled for release next week, the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America (CFA) analyzed the finances and savings of Black households before and during the pandemic. The report not surprisingly found that Black households had less net worth and savings compared with White households. America Saves is a campaign coordinated by CFA to advocate for fee-free savings accounts and automatic savings initiatives by financial institutions and employers.

Here’s something noteworthy in the CFA report: Between 2010 and 2019, the percentage of Black households that saved rose from 39 percent to 47 percent, an increase of 21 percent, according to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances.

CFA notes that the Fed data found many Black households negatively impacted by the Great Recession had begun to make a slow but steady recovery. Although only 35 percent of Black households had retirement accounts, the median assets in those accounts increased 67 percent to $35,000 in 2019 from $20,900 in 2013.

“Black households were better prepared than years earlier to cope with an accompanying recession in which many were fired, furloughed, or had work hours cut,” write Barany and Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at CFA.

With Congress stalled on another stimulus package, people are left to figure out how to meet their expenses without additional government support in an economy still struggling for a comeback.

Having some savings — even a small amount — can help in a crisis. You may not have enough to pay the rent, but you can buy a bag of groceries perhaps. The problem is that only 42 percent of Blacks have a traditional savings account and/or a money market deposit account.

“It’s not easy for people with lower incomes to save, but the current crisis demonstrates how important it is to make it a top priority,” Brobeck said.

America Saves has partnered with the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE), utilizing the Yellow Ribbon Network. This online platform normally serves veterans, active military and their families but has expanded to connect anyone impacted by the pandemic with certified financial counselors and coaches at no cost. To sign up for a virtual session, go to yellowribbonnetwork.org/afcpecovid19.

The best way to save is to do it automatically. Set up direct deposits to a savings account when you get paid. Keep your savings away from your regular household account. I don’t carry the debit card connected to my emergency fund.

“We encourage people, even if it’s $5 per paycheck or $10 per paycheck, to set up an automatic system, because it’s the system that’s key,” Barany said.

Maybe you truly don’t have the ability to save now, and there’s no shame in that. But for those who can, do it now. The pandemic is a harsh reminder for all Americans — but especially Black households — that having an emergency fund is critical in a financial crisis.

Those conclusions contrast sharply with the prevailing wisdom in the United States, where public health officials have focused on low rates of positive coronavirus tests in the broader community as a prerequisite for in-person schooling. Some U.S. school districts recently announced that they are going remote again, as coronavirus cases rise, and other districts have yet to reopen their classrooms at all.

“It is still difficult for me to understand why schools are closed in the United States,” said Otto Helve, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare who has studied coronavirus transmission in schools. “Schools are not driving the epidemic.”

Though cases among students and teachers have risen along with overall viral levels in their communities, the rate at which the virus has been passed on within classrooms has stayed low and constant — unlike universities, which have emerged as a concern.

In Finland, 20,000 of about 1.2 million students and teachers this school year have been asked to quarantine because of possible in-school exposure, Helve said. But just 1 percent of that group — about 200 people — has gone on to exhibit any coronavirus symptoms and then tested positive. Not everyone without symptoms gets tested, but based on those who have, another 1 percent of these people probably have ­asymptomatic cases of the virus, Helve said.

Skeptics say schools aren’t ­doing enough testing to have a true sense of how much the virus is spreading. But communities with enough resources to conduct broader testing after possible exposure haven’t typically found many asymptomatic cases hiding among teachers and students. And because most European schools have embraced bubbles, where students and teachers mix only with their class and no one else, thorough contact tracing can be done in schools even when it falters in wider society.

“We are not seeing the tip of the iceberg; we are seeing the whole iceberg because of our good tracing,” said Quique Bassat, a Spanish pediatrician and epidemiologist who was the coordinator of the Spanish Pediatrics Association’s working group for school reopenings.

In Spain, coronavirus cases were already rising sharply across the country in early September, as classrooms prepared to reopen for the first time since the pandemic hit.

“There were legitimate concerns that perhaps we were fueling the epidemic, and perhaps we were adding more fuel to the fire, and this was going to be the apocalypse,” Bassat said. “To the surprise of many, reopening the schools, applying all these measures in a strict way, controlled transmission, and there were no big outbreaks.”

In Bassat’s region, Catalonia, 87 percent of initial cases in classrooms did not spread to another person. And among the 13 percent that did, the “vast majority” spread to only two or three other people in the school, he said.

The virus’s onward spread was limited even though Spain’s positive coronavirus test rate — 13 percent at its peak in early November, and 10 percent now — is far higher than the level that many U.S. school districts have said is acceptable for in-person schooling. New York City closed its schools last month after 3 percent of city tests came back positive, then reversed itself and made plans to resume classes for the youngest grades.

Most Spanish schools have continued without interruption for the youngest age groups, up to about 12. In Spain and elsewhere, high schools have been more likely than younger grades to switch to part-time or full-time remote education, since risks of infection and transmission appear higher among teenagers than among younger children.

France, which spiked worse than Spain last month, also saw relatively low numbers in schools. The week of France’s peak last month, 0.1 percent of students and 0.2 percent of school personnel tested positive for the coronavirus. Across the country, 142 of 528,400 classrooms quarantined, about 0.03 percent, while 21 of 61,500 schools went into fuller quarantine, according to data from the education ministry.

Rising infection levels among German children have sparked nervousness there, but public health experts say that partly reflects a more relaxed approach to safety measures. People between the ages of 15 and 19 have been among the most-infected in Germany in recent weeks, and cases among them tripled between mid-October and their peak in mid-November — faster than those among the population at large, which doubled. Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for stricter mask-wearing and smaller class sizes, but those decisions are left up to individual states.

Overall, while some parents and teachers unions continue to have concerns, many European societies are broadly behind efforts to keep students in their classrooms. Advocates of in-person school say the cost of virtual classrooms for vulnerable students is steep, as is the economic toll of taking parents out of the workforce because their young children are at home.

“It’s not that we think schools are no danger, that there’s no effect,” said Steven Van Gucht, the head of viral diseases at the Belgian public health agency. “Schools are the last thing to close; they’re really the last thing on the list. There is political pressure and societal pressure. We consider schooling an absolute priority.”

Austria, the Czech Republic and Italy have been exceptions within Europe, opting for widespread school shutdowns or restricted reopenings amid outbreaks. In Italy, that decision sparked protests from students, who in several cities donned hats and gloves and sat with their laptops outside their school buildings, saying they have a right to in-person education.

Pandemic measures are significantly less polarized in Europe than they are in the United States, where President Trump has contradicted his own scientific advisers and made reopening society a political loyalty test, sparking backlash among his opponents. Teachers unions, which have emerged as a powerful force of opposition to school reopenings in the United States, have generally been more acquiescent in Europe, pushing for safety measures rather than closures.

And European societies have generally been willing to make sacrifices to keep schools open, such as banning indoor dining or channeling money for safety measures that in some countries are estimated to cost about $12,000 a month for a school of 1,000 students.

Cristina Trujillo’s English-

instruction classroom in the southern Spanish city of Seville now has a carbon dioxide monitor to keep watch over how much exhaled air is building up. Some rooms have had new windows cut into them so that air can flow in from two sides. The school, Colegio Santo Ángel de la Guarda, bought N95 masks for its teachers. Then, when their voices became too muffled, it bought them microphones. They’ll get voice lessons next month to project better. Because students can’t leave books in their classroom overnight anymore — that would get in the way of the thorough disinfection — their load has been lightened by doing work on Chromebooks that the school purchased for the pandemic. The school’s technology coordinator now devotes most of his time to keeping everyone safe: checking carbon dioxide levels, overseeing renovations, buying masks and hand gel.

Keeping the virus in check is “easier in school,” Trujillo said. “Here, the environment is under control.”

As cases mounted across Spain, to levels that at their Nov. 4 peak were comparable to those in the United States, not a single case spread inside the school, officials said. Two teachers and 11 students brought cases into classrooms from outside, but none infected anyone else.

Bassat said he worried less about the risk from in-person education and more about what happens when the country’s 8 million students get a break from it. Spain has three-week winter holidays, and children will stay at home or mix with family and friends. The transition from a controlled to an uncontrolled environment could be perilous, he said.

Policymakers across Europe say students can and do infect one another. Sometimes they bring cases home and infect their families. But even in societies where cases have been off-the-charts, as was the case for Belgium in October, public health officials say they believe cases in schools reflected viral growth in society at large but weren’t a driver of it. One indicator: Incidence of the virus among teachers and students never exceeded that of the country at large.

When Belgium buckled under a second wave in which daily cases peaked at 1,536 per million people — more than three times the level in the United States right now — it doubled a preplanned post-Halloween school vacation to two weeks, creating a 14-day circuit breaker that built on a broad, nationwide lockdown. Afterward, schools resumed, and infections have dropped for weeks.

“It is very clear to everyone what the downsides are to having school closures,” Helve said. “The downside to closing would need to be compensated by an extremely good outcome in terms of disease control, and it doesn’t seem to do that.”

Investigators at the Department of Homeland Security are bracing for a new wave of fraud attempts by criminal groups that officials expect will try to take advantage of the extraordinary demand for doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Pfizer and Moderna, the two drug companies that applied for emergency vaccine approval this week, have said they will produce enough doses for about 20 million people this month. Health-care employees, law enforcement personnel and other front-line workers are expected to be first in line.

Production will ramp up after that, but it will probably take several months for companies to make enough doses for the nation’s entire population of 330 million. Fraudsters looking to exploit that unmet demand are a concern for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that announced a new operation this week to stop them.

“We’re especially concerned about financial fraud schemes, as people who are thinking they’re going onto legitimate websites are asked to provide financial or personal data,” said Steve Francis, the assistant director for global trade investigations at ICE and the head of the agency’s Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. “We’re trying to stay ahead of these criminal organizations, who are very creative in finding ways to try to exploit people.”

During the first phase of the ICE operation this spring, the agency targeted criminals who were trying to ship counterfeit personal protective equipment, such as fake N95 masks, as well as phony tablets of drugs like hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment that President Trump has repeatedly promoted.

ICE has analyzed more than 700 pandemic-related criminal investigations since April, seizing $27 million in illicit profits and shutting down 70,000 website domains, Francis said.

The agency is more worried about data theft and financial fraud than criminal groups shipping fake vials of the vaccine, Francis said: “We’re concerned that people will go online searching for ways to become vaccinated, and they will be asked to register to receive treatments by providing personal identifying information.”

Approximately 85 to 90 percent of the work of the Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center in recent years has focused on counterfeit goods produced in China and Hong Kong, but the pandemic brought a rapid diversification. Investigative teams have disrupted fraud schemes and seized goods from at least 40 countries this year, Francis said.

“This is a global pandemic, and with PPE in high demand, criminal organizations all over the world pivoted to that,” he said.

While ICE is best known for its Enforcement and Removal Operations division — responsible for arresting and detaining immigration violators — its investigative branch is one of the federal government’s main tools for rooting out fraud and interdicting counterfeit goods.

“We will continue to use our broad legal authorities and long-standing relationships with domestic and international law enforcement agencies and private sector partners to address this emerging public health threat, and will sustain our efforts to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks seeking to profit from the covid-19 pandemic,” Derek Benner, HSI’s top official, said in a statement. “ICE HSI has been at the forefront of the government’s investigative response to covid-19-related crime since the onset of the pandemic and will remain a leader in the fight to prevent vaccine fraud and to protect the health and safety of Americans.”

Homeland Security officials are working with drugmakers to ensure that vaccines and other products are clearly labeled, Francis said. The companies will set up hotlines to gather tips about potential fraud.

Francis said the first shipments of vaccines distributed in the United States will be produced domestically, but as production also increases globally, customs officials and other inspectors will continue to work with companies to keep fake products out of the market.

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will require two doses, spaced several weeks apart.

The coronavirus didn’t seem like a big deal to Craig Buescher at first. Still, he thought he was being careful. He wore a mask in public — most of the time. He limited his circle of friends, but still saw six or eight people. He largely followed the rules, but admits that he occasionally stretched them.

Buescher was 69 and in good health. Surely, he thought, the virus wouldn’t be that bad if he came down with it.

While he doesn’t know how he ultimately contracted the virus, it was, in fact, quite bad. Nine days in the hospital, as he struggled to breathe, convinced him that not only did he need to be more careful to avoid the virus, but also that he should persuade others to do the same.

“I couldn’t walk across the room without stopping,” said Buescher, of South Bend, Neb. “That proved to be the thing that made a believer out of me.”

For all those like Buescher, who has become more cautious since the pandemic was declared in March, millions of others continue to resist recommended precautions or have stopped following public health guidance because of pandemic fatigue. Officials and health experts are sounding the alarm about the virus’s dangerous surge — the United States is logging more than 160,000 new infections per day on average — while many desperately try to determine how to persuade people to change their behavior.

To be sure, plenty of Americans are heeding officials’ advice to limit their time in public places, avoid small gatherings and stay away from large crowds. But a Gallup poll conducted in September found that the numbers of people who report doing each of those things have been trending downward and are at their lowest levels since March: 70 percent said they had avoided large crowds in the past week, 53 percent had stayed away from public places and 45 percent had forgone small gatherings.

Most people who are ignoring public health recommendations probably either don’t perceive themselves as at-risk for severe consequences of the coronavirus or don’t believe the suggested behaviors will protect them, experts say.

Social norms also have a big impact on decision-making. In places where most people are following the guidelines, others are likely to follow. Because the United States did not create uniform norms early in the pandemic, wearing masks and maintaining distance are still unpopular in some places.

Changing those norms by highlighting the many people who are following the rules could be key to persuading others to alter their behavior, research shows.

“Even when we know what we SHOULD be doing, if we find out that other people aren’t doing it, we probably won’t do it,” Vanessa Bohns, who teaches organizational behavior at Cornell University, wrote in an email. “Interestingly, lots of persuasive messaging undermines itself by saying, ‘You should do this,’ and then immediately afterwards saying, ‘But most people aren’t doing this.’”

Meeting the virus face-to-face

Despite attempts to shift social norms, experts say the most effective factor in shifting people’s behavior may still be personal encounters with the dangers of the virus. While many Americans still flout public health measures after having close experiences with the pathogen, psychologists are hopeful that there’s a tipping point at which the amount of people who act more cautiously after a personal experience will affect the pandemic’s trajectory.

For Buescher, it took getting sick for him to buckle down on mask-wearing and social distancing. His brush with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, came in September, when he noticed that his legs were weak and he felt tired all the time. He said his doctor prescribed him medication and urged him to go to an emergency room if his blood-oxygen level dipped below 90 percent.

Soon it did, Buescher said, and his wife drove him to the hospital. After eight days of supplemental oxygen, his daughter told him that his doctors warned her at one point that they would have to put him on a ventilator if his breathing didn’t improve.

The experience left Buescher a changed man — one who keeps two or three masks in each of the family’s cars so they’re always prepared, and he has tightened his social circle to one other couple. He and his wife celebrated Thanksgiving with their four adult children over Zoom, and they’re rethinking their Christmas plans.

“There’ll be other Christmases,” Buescher said, “unless we’re not responsible.”

Buescher has also become an evangelist for coronavirus-conscious decision-making. He makes sure to wear a mask when he goes into a business, even though he’s now unlikely to be infectious, because he wants to set a good example. He’s been sharing his covid-19 experience with others through Facebook posts. And he recently spoke at one of Gov. Pete Ricketts’s news conferences to urge fellow Nebraskans to be cautious.

“Is this something we’re going to do every year?” Buescher said at the news conference, of his family’s plan to celebrate Thanksgiving virtually. “No, we’ve got to do it this year so that we have the capabilities of getting back on track next year.”

As word spread in his small town that the virus hit him hard, Buescher said others have told him that hearing about his experience changed their own behavior. One of those friends was Chuck Baum, who said he felt at the onset of the pandemic like the constant crush of coronavirus news might be just a lot of crying wolf.

It wasn’t that Baum and his wife weren’t taking any precautions. He got sent home from his job in the livestock industry. They paused their habit of eating at a restaurant every other week. Neither of them went to big weddings or funerals anymore.

But the virus seemed to be on every TV station, all the time. Who knew how bad it really was?

“At some point in time, you tune the news media out,” said Baum, of Denton, Neb. “Until you start knowing people that are dying, then it becomes real.”

Buescher wasn’t the only person who helped make the virus feel more real to Baum. First it was a friend in his 60s, who died in March. Then his college roommate’s father succumbed to the virus. In October, one of his customers died two days after Baum found out the man was sick.

The biggest change Baum said he has made since seeing friends die of the virus is no longer going inside his 92-year-old mother’s house. He has visited her twice in the past month, but now he opens the kitchen door and the screen door and talks to her from outside.

That kind of change is unsurprising to Donald Edmondson, who leads the Science of Behavior Change, a network supported by the National Institutes of Health that uses experimental medicine to study behavior change. As more members of a community become seriously ill and die of covid-19, Edmondson said, the norms in that area are likely to eventually change.

“There has to be a point at which there’s a feedback loop that begins to shift behaviors,” he said.

Choosing the right messenger

Talking to people about the dangers of the virus can also influence people’s behavior, but only if the message is coming from someone they trust, experts say. A breakdown of faith in institutions has left many skeptical of anything they’re told by government officials, academics or journalists.

Some people are so mired in disinformation that experts believe it would be hard to persuade them to change their behaviors. Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. adults believes the coronavirus is less lethal than the seasonal flu, and 41 percent think the official coronavirus death toll has been overstated, according to a Gallup/Knight Foundation poll conducted in September.

“The best bang for your buck is going to be those people who are on the fence who are just tired,” said Jay Van Bavel, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. “You can probably get through to more of them than people who are just very far gone.”

For those who consume mostly accurate information, the key is for people to directly encourage their family members and friends to make safe choices. Van Bavel pointed as an example to social media campaigns such as the “Ice Bucket Challenge,” which made waves online in 2014 and raised millions of dollars for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research.

It’s important for public health officials to communicate risk-mitigation measures to people who will listen, Van Bavel said, but it’s equally crucial that those people share them with their loved ones who aren’t inclined to believe authority figures. People are more inclined to agree to requests from people they like, research shows.

For those who have been convinced by arguments that wearing masks or maintaining social distance are an assault on freedom, Van Bavel said he would redefine freedom as the ability to move through society more freely if everyone takes precautions such as wearing masks. He said people are sensitive to the idea that they are losing something, so he would also suggest that the real risk is not losing freedom.

“I would frame it as, the real risk of loss is not missing a holiday with the family,” Van Bavel said. “It’s missing the family — having them die or have permanent lung damage or brain damage or psychiatric problems.”

With access to coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, experts say there’s another strategy for persuading people to be cautious: reminding them that the pandemic’s end is in sight and they wouldn’t want to contract the virus soon before they could have been inoculated.

Van Bavel compared the situation to the “marshmallow test,” a well-known psychological experiment in which a child could either eat a marshmallow right away or stay unaccompanied with it in the room for up to 20 minutes and then receive two marshmallows as a reward for her patience.

“We’re now in a marshmallow test as a society,” Van Bavel said. “We need to tell people that you can have those two marshmallows, you can have lots of gatherings with family, lots of trips, lots of economic activities, if you can just hold off for a few minutes and not eat the marshmallow right now.”

While trying to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) has faced throngs of armed protesters at the statehouse and crowds outside his home. Now, he is facing efforts from within his own party to push him out of office entirely.

A group of four Republican state lawmakers filed a dozen articles of impeachment against DeWine on Monday, saying the governor violated state and federal laws by requiring masks in public and ordering some businesses to close.

“Rather than hearing the cries of Ohioans, Gov. DeWine continues to stifle those cries by finding more inventive ways to use masks to muffle the voices of the people,” state Rep. John Becker (R) said in a statement.

But with the pandemic having killed more than 267,000 people across the country and at least 6,429 in Ohio, DeWine brushed off their efforts and urged the lawmakers to focus on those suffering from or fighting covid-19 on the front lines.

“There’s a small number of people out there making a lot of noise,” he said during a news conference Monday. “I just wish they’d go spend some time talking to somebody who suffered through this.”

As governors around the country have worked to contain the virus, many have been met with fierce political resistance and even threats of violence. Last week, a county board in rural Michigan approved a resolution supporting the impeachment of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who had been targeted by a failed kidnapping plot earlier this year.

Amid anti-lockdown protests in the spring, clashes with President Trump and spats with other state lawmakers, no other governor has seen that backlash turn into a serious effort to remove them from office before the end of their term.

DeWine, who won his first term in 2018, rapidly emerged as a leader in the nation’s response to the coronavirus. A former U.S. senator, the 73-year-old governor moved early and aggressively to close schools and restaurants and delay Ohio’s primary election.

When crowds of demonstrators repeatedly descended on the state capitol to protest Ohio’s top health official and statewide lockdown measures, he urged them to target him instead.

“I’m the elected official. I’m the one who ran for office. I’m the one who makes the policy decisions,” he said during a daily news briefing in May. “So when you don’t like the policy, you can demonstrate against me.”

In August, three hard-line conservative lawmakers, including Becker, drafted and threatened to file 10 articles of impeachment against DeWine. Ohio House Speaker Bob Cupp (R) called their efforts an “imprudent attempt” to escalate disagreements over policy.

DeWine, too, was quick to dismiss the effort.

“My priorities are to keep people safe and to get our economy moving faster,” the governor said at the time. “If there are others in the legislature who want to spend their time drawing up resolutions and filing articles … I’d just say to them, ‘Have at it.’ ”

Three months later, the GOP representatives tried again. In articles of impeachment filed Monday, Becker and three co-signers alleged that DeWine overstepped his authority as governor and violated the separation of powers doctrine established in the Ohio Constitution, committing acts of “mismanagement, malfeasance, abuse of power and other crimes.”

Besides singling out a nightly curfew instituted last month, they accused him of “meddling” in the Ohio primary and “weaponizing” a state agency, the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, to “bully and harass businesses and the people” into wearing masks in public.

For an Ohio governor to be impeached, a majority of the state House of Representatives would need to approve the resolution, and two-thirds of the state Senate would then need to vote to convict. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers.

Asked about the impeachment effort during a Monday news conference, DeWine urged anyone denying or trying to distract from the virus to instead speak with health workers tending to coronavirus patients.

“At some point, this foolishness has got to stop,” DeWine said during a news conference, during which he appeared beside a group of nurses. “I’m not talking about most Ohioans — just a small number of people who for whatever reason just continue to think and act this is some big joke and this is all some fantasy.”

More than 500 people scheduled to be tested for the novel coronavirus Tuesday at Union Station in Los Angeles will now be able to get those tests after the mayor intervened to keep the site open following news that testing was canceled so a production crew could film the remake to the teen romantic comedy “She’s All That.”

“My team has worked to reopen testing at Union Station on Tuesday,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said in an early-morning tweet Tuesday. “The 504 Angelenos who were scheduled for a test there can visit the kiosk as originally planned or any of the other 14 City sites, where we offer 38K tests daily.”

The reversal came after swift backlash from residents who questioned the city’s leadership for putting the filming of a rom-com ahead of the health and safety of its citizens.

The remake, “He’s All That,” will continue filming while testing is happening Tuesday, according to Deadline, the first to report the story. The Miramax movie starring TikTok personality Addison Rae, which was granted a permit to film by FilmLA, was expected to have a cast and crew of about 170 people at Union Station on Tuesday, Deadline reported.

The outlet reported that Curative, the company that operates the testing site, originally felt the production would make for a disruptive environment in which social distancing would be too difficult to enforce. Representatives for Curative did not immediately return a request for comment.

The drama playing out at one of the city’s busiest testing sites comes amid a record-breaking stretch of coronavirus cases for Los Angeles County. The county is under new stay-at-home restrictions from the nearly 25,000 new cases in the last week, the most of any county in the United States, according to The Washington Post’s coronavirus tracker. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported 5,150 new cases of the coronavirus on Monday, and a record-breaking 2,185 hospitalizations in the county.

Word of the testing site’s temporary closure started to spread online Monday after a copy of an email sent by Curative was shared by the Los Angeles homeless advocacy group Ktown For All. In the notice, Curative expressed regret in telling 504 people with Tuesday appointments at Union Station that their scheduled tests had been canceled.

“We apologize for the inconvenience and delayed notification but LA Union Station Kiosk site has had to cancel all appointments for December 1st due to an event being held at this location,” the company wrote. “We know this is a huge convenience and again apologize for the delayed notification!”

In the middle of a horrible and terrifying COVID spike, LA just cancelled all of its Dec 1 appointments at Union Station (one of the only transit-accessible facilities) with less than 24hrs notice because of A FILM SHOOT!! @MayorOfLA @metrolosangeles @lapublichealth WTF???!!??? pic.twitter.com/zwR36TH4G4 — Ktown for All 💜❤ (@KtownforAll) December 1, 2020

The reasoning for why the site needed to be closed for the day would soon come to light: Union Station was needed to film the remake of the 1999 movie starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook about a guy who boasts how he can make any girl in school popular.

The Union Station site tests an average of 350 to 400 people daily, accounting for about 1 percent of the city’s total tests. Its popularity as a testing site stems from it being one of the only transit-accessible locations in the area.

With the county in the middle of a record-breaking spike in coronavirus cases, the news came as a surprise to Garcetti, whose office said it had only learned of the delay earlier Monday. The same went for FilmLA, the group that processes film permit applications. Philip Sokoloski, a spokesman for FilmLA, told the Los Angeles Times that the company wasn’t sure who decided that the testing center at Union Station would be shuttered during filming.

“All we know at this hour is that this decision wasn’t made by FilmLA or the City’s film permit approver LAPD, nor was it sought by the production company seeking to film at Union Station,” Sokoloski said.

Before Garcetti’s announcement, Sokoloski told the Times that he was optimistic that “the two uses of the facility may be compatible” to allow for hundreds to be tested for the virus on Tuesday.

Critics like Ktown For All spokesman Devon Manney told the New York Times that the process getting to the point it did was a slap in the face for residents who’ve had to rely on public transportation to travel to Union Station to be tested for a virus that is crippling the city.

“This is the L.A. that we are constantly fighting against,” Manney said.

An elderly man in a hospital gown buried his head in the arms of a doctor who, fully clad in protective equipment, hugged and consoled the patient. The doctor’s fixed, disturbed gaze can be seen through the plastic face shield. “I want to be with my wife,” the frail patient, battling covid-19, had told Joseph Varon, chief of staff at the United Memorial Medical Center in Houston. Varon had found the man out of his hospital bed, crying and seeking help.

The emotional moment was captured on Thanksgiving Day by photographer Go Nakamura, who was in the covid ward documenting the pandemic for Getty Images.

The image circulated widely online over the weekend after Nakamura posted it on Facebook, resonating with the pain and struggle of millions of Americans, patients and health workers alike as the country reels from soaring coronavirus infections and hospitalizations.

“I am grateful to witness a wonderful moment and I thank all the medical staffs for their hard work even during the holiday season,” Nakamura wrote on Facebook.

The post has since been shared hundreds of times and prompted heartfelt reactions from users on social media.

“I am so glad the photo went viral because people are talking about what is really happening inside of hospitals,” Nakamura told The Washington Post.

“I believe the photo can be the door to certain people so they can start to realize what is going on and what the reality is in the world right now,” he said, referring to the skepticism about the severity of the coronavirus and the extent of the crisis that persists among many Americans.

Nakamura was standing in the corner of the intensive care unit room when the encounter unfolded. He swiftly took his camera out and started shooting, trying to capture a moment that symbolized both the anguish and loneliness felt by so many patients separated from their loved ones for days on end, as well as the quiet, often unnoticed acts of compassion by medical workers.

The photographer has visited the medical center more than 20 times and said he has witnessed many acts of generosity by Varon, whom he described as a “warm, big-hearted person,” as well as his staff members.

“I was feeling sad, just like him, and I was just recollecting all the patients that I have had to do similar things with,” Varon told CNN on Monday.

“I would go into their rooms, sit on their beds and chat with them because they truly need somebody,” he said, adding that covid patients often cry and that some have even tried to escape the hospital, unable to bear the sting of isolation.

The man depicted in the photograph is recovering and is expected to be discharged this week, Varon said.

But with the surge of infections overwhelming hospitals across Texas, health workers at the United Memorial Medical Center are sometimes incapable of offering more comfort to their patients, Varon said.

Last week, Texas reported the nation’s second-highest number of infections in a single day, with 16,100 — about 1,000 more cases than a previous high. The state has reached more than 1,200,000 cases and more than 21,000 deaths, according to data gathered by The Post.

Amid the surge, the strain on health workers and hospitals is growing as well, pushing many to their limits.

Varon, who says he has worked for more than 250 days straight, has repeatedly warned about the severity of the crisis in the state and pleaded with people to acknowledge the danger of the virus and follow preventive measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing.

But no relief seems to be on the horizon, with health workers and experts expecting an even bigger surge in cases following the holiday.

Just a day before Thanksgiving, Varon sent a chilling warning in an interview with CNN. If people refuse “to do the right thing,” he said, “America will face the darkest days in modern American medical history.”

Nakamura’s photograph offered a glimpse of what those days might look like.

Christina Paz was typing up notes about a patient she’d just seen at Centro San Vicente, El Paso’s largest community health center, when an email from Washington showed up. “Lord,” she thought as she read it at the clinic’s nursing station. “Oh, my God.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The brief email told Paz, a nurse practitioner who is the clinic’s chief executive officer, that at 11:59 p.m. on March 22 the federal COVID-19 Uninsured Program would stop accepting claims for testing and treating for the deadly virus on patients who had no way to pay their medical bills.

On the Wednesday afternoon when Paz opened the federal notice, that deadline loomed just six days away. For a clinic where nearly two-thirds of patients are classified as “unfunded,” the $252,000 the federal program has sent Centro San Vicente has been a lifeline as its staff treated more than 2,000 patients for covid and tested thousands more.

Now, the health center blocks from the Rio Grande is one of more than 50,000 providers of health services nationwide that have run out of time to claim reimbursement from the Department of Health and Human Services for coronavirus testing and care of those without health coverage. And another deadline nears — April 5 — to submit charges for vaccinating the uninsured.

The wind-down of the uninsured program is among the first concrete casualties of a decision by Congress this month to exclude about $15 billion in pandemic relief from a large spending plan adopted for other parts of the government and the Ukraine war.

The Biden administration has been trying to draw attention to the consequences if lawmakers continue bickering over whether to provide more coronavirus aid. The White House and health officials say the government will not have enough vaccines to give every American a fourth shot to protect against the virus, if federal regulators approve the additional booster, and soon will lack money to buy additional monoclonal antibodies to treat coronavirus infections.

Those pandemic-fighting hindrances could lie in the near future. The uninsured program already is ending.

Since it was created in spring 2020 as one of several pools of pandemic aid for health-care providers, the uninsured program has provided more than $20 billion in reimbursements to medical labs, hospitals, doctor’s offices, pharmacies and clinics. But as it winds down, its absence — unless Congress acts — will be felt most keenly in the health-care system’s safety net, focused on patients who have no health coverage. Often, those patients are low-income Black Americans or Latinos whose communities have been scarred by the greatest illness and death from the pandemic.

They are places like Harris Health System in Houston, which runs Ben Taub and Lyndon B. Johnson hospitals and a network of clinics. Of more than 16,000 patients with covid admitted to one of those hospitals or treated by a Harris facility as outpatients, 47 percent have been uninsured.

Without the federal program, “there is no way we would have been able to care for the number of patients we’ve cared for,” said Esmaeil Porsa, Harris’s chief executive officer. At one point, covid patients filled 22 of the 23 intensive care beds at LBJ, the smaller hospital.

“I was basically running a covid hospital,” Porsa said.

When the initial pandemic relief laws provided money to health-care providers, safety-net facilities were not helped much at first. Trying to get money out quickly, HHS began by allotting aid in ways that benefited some well-heeled hospitals that had a lot of revenue or many Medicare patients.

But since federal health officials began setting aside a pool for coronavirus care of the uninsured later that first pandemic spring, Harris has been reimbursed for almost $200 million in services. As a result, doctors, nurses and administrators, stressed by the pandemic’s enormity, have been spared the added pressure of considering how to close some other medical services for lack of money. “That’s been a huge blessing,” Porsa said.

As the program winds down, the financial pressure isn’t that intense at the moment, because coronavirus case rates have ebbed, Porsa said. But he said he fears what will happen if a new omicron subvariant, like the BA.2, produces another spike in infections and illness.

“That’s the worrying part. We don’t have a clue what’s in store for us,” Porsa said.

At OIC Family Medical Center in Rocky Mount, N.C., fears of another surge weigh heavily as the money is going away.

“I do anticipate it will be a hill to climb to respond adequately,” said Reuben C. Blackwell IV, president and chief executive of a nonprofit that includes the clinic. In a small city with residents who are largely Black and relatively poor, nearly one-third of OIC patients are uninsured.

Payments through the program and other public pandemic aid allowed the clinic to hire 20 “covid interns” to fan out into the community to encourage people to get coronavirus tests and shots. Twice a month, they go into day-care centers and homeless shelters to give tests. They reach into parts of the community where Internet access is scarce, making it hard for people to sign up online for tests or vaccines. OIC has served about 3,800 uninsured patients and been reimbursed nearly $130,000.

In the last few weeks, having heard ahead of time that the uninsured program would end, Blackwell said, 11 of those covid interns were let go, and three of the remaining workers have been switched to part-time.

With the funding winding down, “it’s now all on us to make it work or not. That’s scary. We don’t have a lot to work with,” said Blackwell, who also is a Rocky Mount City Council member. “I just hope that, somewhere in Washington, they have a door locked with some money inside.”

According to HHS’s Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the agency that has overseen the program, it has been spending about $2 billion a month lately on claims — more than $20 billion since the start. For the past few months, as it became clear the money would soon run out, the agency brought that “burn rate” to the attention of others in the administration who “have been making that very clear to Congress,” said an HRSA official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.

This month, the White House Office of Management and Budget sent House and Senate leaders a two-page letter laying out “immediate needs to avoid disruption to ongoing covid response efforts over the next few months.” One item was $1.5 billion for the uninsured program — less than the program has been spending in a month.

Advocates for hospitals and community health centers have been pressing lawmakers to pour more money into the program.

Talks are continuing on Capitol Hill, with Republican lawmakers stipulating that they will consider more pandemic aid only if they become convinced there is a clear way to pay for it.

Amid that uncertainty, the HRSA official said agency leaders felt “not great” sending the March 16 email, addressed to “Valued Provider,” one of whom was Paz in El Paso.

“HRSA’s mission is to address these kind of health disparities, to serve these kind of populations,” the official said. “And so obviously, we don’t want to be winding down a program if there’s a need.”

In the meantime, health-care facilities that have relied heavily on the money are confronting wrinkles.

One involves a routine lag between when a doctor, clinic, hospital or medical lab provides a service and when the paperwork is submitted to claim reimbursement from the federal government. It is uncertain how much care has been provided for which it is too late to send in a claim.

A second problem is hinted at in the email and involves claims filed before the deadline that have not yet been reimbursed. It says that claims that arrive in time “will be paid subject to … availability of funds.”

HRSA officials declined to say how much money the uninsured program has in hand to cover reimbursements, even when the claims reached HRSA before the deadline for treatment and testing — or will arrive in early April before the deadline for vaccinations. The official said only that the agency had “received a significant increase in claims leading up to the deadline that are working their way through the system. We are in the process of adjudicating millions of claims subject to the funds that remain available.”

At Harris in Houston, the health system is still waiting to be paid for more than $7 million in claims that were pending a few days before the March 22 deadline. Harris is not expecting that all those claims will be paid, said a Harris spokesman, Bryan McLeod.

If the money runs out without Congress providing more, “there are going to be some tough calls” for the nation’s health-care safety net, the HRSA official said.

Under rules set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronavirus vaccines must be given at no charge. The question of possibly charging for coronavirus tests is more ambiguous, and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra has hinted at that in public. At a recent White House briefing, he was asked whether uninsured people could face bills for coronavirus services if Congress does not act soon.

“We’ll exhaust every dollar we have,” Becerra said. He said “we’re going to do what we can” to keep coronavirus services available “[w]hether it is moving toward allowing Americans to purchase these through other means or secure them through other means, or whether it means getting the support from Congress that allows us to continue to offer those for free.”

One company that operates coronavirus testing sites and medical labs, Quest Diagnostics, notified clients last week that, without the ability to bill HRSA, it no longer can provide tests for free to the uninsured, according to a spokeswoman, Kimberly Gorode. Quest will now charge people without health coverage $125 for a PCR test, Gorode said.

Without the federal uninsured program, leaders of health-care institutions that serve the poor worry the burden on them could grow.

“If anything, covid has taught us to be nimble,” said David Zaas, chief executive of the Medical University of South Carolina’s University Medical Center in Charleston. The medical center is the hub of a health system that has tested 66,000 people who turned up positive for the virus. The hospital has admitted nearly 6,000 people with covid.

If another surge arrives, MUSC, as it is known, will carry out its mission to serve the underserved, said Zaas, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist. Still, he said he fears that other hospitals without that mission could balk at caring for uninsured covid patients, further straining safety-net hospitals such as his.

At Centro San Vicente, where 80 percent of patients are Hispanic and most live under the poverty line, Paz said she is still shellshocked by the uninsured program drying up. It was the “huge cushion,” she said, that allowed the clinic’s four sites across El Paso to avoid furloughs and layoffs as the costs of coping with the pandemic soared.

“We all knew at some point the funding was going to stop. We didn’t anticipate it from one night to another. I don’t have a strategy how we are going to compensate.” In the world of community health centers, she said, “we all wear a million hats. We have yet to have time to sit down and talk.”

The one thing she knows, Paz said, is that “covid is not going away.”

Late on Sunday evening, the Chinese financial hub of Shanghai announced it was going into lockdown, one half at a time, reversing weeks of denying it would impose blanket restrictions on the city’s 25 million residents. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight For much of the world, the arrival of the highly transmissible omicron coronavirus variant has cemented acceptance that the virus is here to stay and should be mitigated but tolerated. In China, though, rising case numbers appear to be reinforcing policies to smother the virus rather than accelerating plans to gradually ease restrictions.

This month, China has faced its worst outbreak since the coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan. From March 1 to 24, the country had reported 56,000 infections — more than the total cases in Wuhan two years ago. On Sunday, 6,215 positive tests were recorded, with 3,500 of those in Shanghai.

The resurgence has created a dilemma for Chinese policymakers. They recently announced that a road map was being created to ease the “zero covid” approach and that cities were experimenting with more targeted and short-lived containment protocols. Treatment guidelines were updated to allow asymptomatic patients to be isolated in centralized facilities, instead of at hospitals. Antigen test kits were approved.

“Local officials are in a tough spot — they are being told to maintain zero-covid and simultaneously limit economic disruption,” analysts at the research firm Trivium China wrote.

“Given the paramount importance of maintaining social stability and preserving China’s sterling record on the coronavirus,” they added, there are unlikely to be major changes in the country’s “dynamic clearing” strategy to totally eliminate the virus before the 20th Party Congress in October. In that key meeting, President Xi Jinping is widely expected to take on a precedent-breaking third term as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

As China’s leading financial hub, Shanghai had been at the forefront of trying out more flexible measures. Last year, when cases were discovered at one of the city’s main international airports, most residents were unaffected. During the current outbreak, too, it had resisted the citywide measures adopted in places like Jilin or Shenzhen, opting instead for rolling, block-by-block home quarantines for two-day periods.

Advertisement

But the approach failed to halt transmission of the virus. After weeks of officials denying citywide restrictions were imminent — police detained two men for spreading “rumors” about it — the Shanghai government announced what has been dubbed a “yin-yang lockdown.”

Starting at 5 a.m. Monday, districts to the east of the Huangpu River, which snakes through the city, are spending four days at home before it becomes the turn of those living west of the waterway, starting at 3 a.m. on Friday.

As residents hurriedly prepared for confinement, they shared pictures of empty supermarket shelves and shoppers scrambling to buy provisions. Local rappers turned the experience into a song about everyone “snatching vegetables then getting PCR tests.”

The decision to escalate restrictions brings Shanghai closer to measures adopted by northeastern Jilin province, which has imposed some of the strictest rules of the most recent outbreak.

Beijing’s staunch adherence to zero covid often appears puzzling to much of the developed world, where, despite much higher case numbers than China’s, blanket lockdowns are no longer considered necessary because of high vaccination rates.

Many in China, too, find it difficult to understand the strategy.

In a sign of mounting impatience, a senior epidemiologist’s response to the question “Why can’t China end epidemic control measures like other countries?” drew nearly 500 million views on the microblog Weibo on Wednesday.

In Shanghai, rapid shifts in policy are wearing out locals like Zoey Yang, a 30-year-old consultant who lives to the west of the Huangpu River. She has gone through one 48-hour isolation period and is preparing for four more days at home.

“There was one day I heard the community broadcast saying that my neighborhood would be put into another lockdown starting at midnight, but the next day, that lockdown was suddenly canceled without explanation,” Yang said. “You can get really confused sometimes.”

“It’s just too difficult,” she added. “We are one of the last countries in the world to still implement a zero-covid policy. How are we going to continue doing this if we want to engage with other countries?”

For most of the pandemic, China’s coronavirus policy has, on balance, been popular at home, especially when compared with waves of rising infections and deaths in other parts of the world.

Officials occasionally acknowledge that the disruptions can be substantial but argue that the trade-off is worth it. Speaking earlier this month, Wang Hesheng, deputy director of the National Health Commission, said China’s ability to maintain regular economic activity and standards of living for most people was conditional on “sacrificing the normal lives of a tiny portion of people and controlling movement in a tiny portion of locations.”

Even as officials work on a plan to live with the virus, they continue to argue that the costs are worth it for the number of lives saved. An officially endorsed study released late last year estimated that China would soon face 630,000 infections per day if it ended international and internal restrictions in an approach similar to that of the United States.

Low vaccination rates among the elderly and concerns about domestic vaccines’ relatively poor efficacy at preventing infection make such projections especially concerning. By extrapolating from the extremely high casualty rates in Hong Kong, which also relied primarily on Chinese vaccines, Britain-based research firm Airfinity recently projected that a million people could die if an outbreak of a similar scale occurred on the Chinese mainland.

Politics feature as much as public health in official explanations for China’s divergence from much of Europe and North America. Earlier this month, Xi told a meeting of the top party officials that the country should stick with dynamic clearance, describing the policy as reflecting the “outstanding advantage of the [Chinese Communist] Party’s socialist system.”

“To persevere is to win,” he added, while also urging the need for more targeted approaches that impose fewer costs on people’s lives.

Public anger continues to be sparked by incidents of unnecessary harm as a side effect of poorly managed lockdowns. Last week, when a nurse in Shanghai died of an asthma attack after being refused admittance to her own hospital, commentators drew comparisons to a pregnant woman who lost her baby after being refused treatment in Xian.

Another sign that people are losing patience is the emergence of a genre of online comedy, loosely modeled on Soviet Union jokes about the secret police, taking aim at overly zealous enforcers of covid policy dubbed “epidemic prevention hobbyists.”

Bliss, goes one joke, is when these enforcers knock on your door in the middle of the night and tell you to quarantine because their advanced systems have identified you as a close contact of an infected person — and it turns out they want the guy down the hall.

People who had covid-19 were at greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes within a year than those who managed to avoid the coronavirus, according to a large review of patient records released Monday. The finding is true even for people who had less severe or asymptomatic forms of coronavirus infection, though the chances of developing new-onset diabetes were greater as the severity of covid symptoms increased, according to researchers who reviewed the records of more than 181,000 Department of Veterans Affairs patients diagnosed with coronavirus infections between March 1, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2021.

Their data was compared to the medical records of more than 4.1 million VA patients who were not infected during the same period and another 4.28 million who received medical care from VA in 2018 and 2019. This kind of study cannot prove cause and effect, but it showed a strong association between the two diseases.

Overall, the researchers calculated that people diagnosed with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were 46 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes for the first time or be prescribed medication to control their blood sugar. The research was released Monday in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, a medical journal.

Put another way, 2 in 100 covid patients were more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, a condition in which the pancreas makes insufficient amounts of the hormone insulin, leaving blood sugar levels poorly controlled. Type 2 diabetes can cause damage to kidneys, nerves, blood vessels and the heart, among its other effects.

The results have implications for the more than 471 million people known to have been infected during the pandemic, nearly 80 million of them in the United States, and especially for people suffering from long-haul covid.

“For the broader public, if you’ve had covid-19, you need to pay attention to your blood sugar,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at VA St. Louis Health Care System, who led the review.

Previous smaller studies and physicians who have treated covid patients have noted an apparent increase in new diabetes diagnoses associated with coronavirus infection. But Al-Aly said his review was the largest consideration of the issue and looked at the greatest length of time after the acute phase of an infection — from 31 days after infection to a median of nearly one year per patient.

VA patients tend to be older than the general population, with more White people and males. But Al-Aly said the large numbers of people involved made him confident that his findings were applicable to the public.

“The risk was evident in all subgroups,” including women, racial minorities, younger people and people with different body mass indexes, he said.

More than 99 percent of the infected VA patients developed Type 2 diabetes, as opposed to Type 1, a condition in which insulin-producing cells in the pancreas stop producing the hormone entirely. Al-Aly speculated that the cells’ reduced efficiency may be caused by inflammation, produced either by the virus itself or the body’s response to it.

“Taken together,” the researchers wrote, “current evidence suggests that diabetes is a facet of the multifaceted long covid syndrome and that post-acute care strategies of people with covid-19 should include identification and management of diabetes.”

Previous smaller studies and physicians who have treated covid patients have noted an apparent increase in new diabetes diagnoses associated with coronavirus infection. But Al-Aly said his review was the largest consideration of the issue and looked at the greatest length of time after the acute phase of an infection — from 31 days after infection to a median of nearly one year per patient.

VA patients tend to be older than the general population, with more White people and males. But Al-Aly said the large numbers of people involved made him confident that his findings were applicable to the public.

“The risk was evident in all subgroups,” including women, racial minorities, younger people and people with different body mass indexes, he said.

More than 99 percent of the infected VA patients developed Type 2 diabetes, as opposed to Type 1, a condition in which insulin-producing cells in the pancreas stop producing the hormone entirely. Al-Aly speculated that the cells’ reduced efficiency may be caused by inflammation, produced either by the virus itself or the body’s response to it.

“Taken together,” the researchers wrote, “current evidence suggests that diabetes is a facet of the multifaceted long covid syndrome and that post-acute care strategies of people with covid-19 should include identification and management of diabetes.”

Two brothers in rural Virginia were hospitalized within days of one another, their airways inflamed. A barber in southeast Washington went on life support as his lungs and kidneys failed. And a grandfather in suburban Maryland, the stoic breadwinner for his large immigrant family, wept when the paramedics took him away.

Fueled by the highly transmissible omicron variant, the coronavirus infected more than 29 million people in the United States over the past three months. It reached individuals across race, class and location. But data showed that it hit unvaccinated and under-vaccinated people hardest, wounding communities with inadequate access to health care and where officials have failed after a year to stamp out vaccine misinformation and distrust.

“I know for most of the country, people were saying it was mild. I can’t say that we saw that here,” said Teresa Tyson, chief executive of the Health Wagon, a mobile clinic that serves the most rural and least-vaccinated counties in Virginia. In January and February, Tyson said, she was forced to rent additional space to accommodate the flood of covid-19 patients, dozens of whom ultimately begged for vaccine doses as they were loaded onto ambulances.







When omicron arrived, covid-19 was a largely preventable disease, health experts said. And yet in the past three months, more than 150,000 people in the United States have died of it, the vast majority of them from underserved pockets of society.

In January, Black U.S. residents were hospitalized for covid-19 at a rate higher than any other race or ethnicity at any point in the pandemic, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Southern California recorded a covid-19 death rate triple that of the Bay Area due to lagging vaccination rates, the Los Angeles Times reported. In the District and surrounding states, one of the most vaccinated regions in the nation, about 7,100 people have lost their lives since Christmas.

While data from the surge is still being compiled, analysis conducted by The Washington Post found that rural communities in Virginia suffered a mortality rate double that of urban communities. In Maryland, poor families of color bore the brunt of the omicron wave. And in the District, Black residents account for 84 percent of covid-19 fatalities since the start of the year, despite making up less than half the population.

With new variants of the coronavirus on the horizon, this pattern of harm will soon repeat itself, experts warn.

“You see someone recognizing in real time that their own illness could have been prevented” and “you feel remorseful with them,” said David Marcozzi, an emergency medicine physician at the University of Maryland Medical System, which was overwhelmed with covid-19 patients during the omicron surge. “You want to go upstream to all of the misinformation out there and stop the story there.”

Reed Tuckson, a founder of the Black Coalition Against Covid, said officials and advocates tried for months to overcome distrust of the vaccines, but misinformation “put gas on a fire that was already out of control.” He added, “I cannot think of anything more that could have been done that was not done. Contemporary history, combined with past history, we were pushed back on our heels. ”

The class divide

It started at a rich person’s bungalow in Northern Virginia. He was there to paint the walls, and she was there to clean the mess. He was 55, tall and handsome with paint splattered across his shirt. She was 40, smiling and radiant even though it had been only two days since she had arrived in the United States from Honduras. They flirted in Spanish. She called him “papi.” A month later, they were married.

By the time Javier Ramirez Reyes met Maria Rodriguez, he had lost most of his family. Her children and grandchildren became his own, and together they settled down in the Maryland suburbs, first in Langley Park, then in Gaithersburg. The couple earned just enough, $900 a week, to support themselves and six relatives in a two-bedroom rental apartment. They bickered sometimes, such as over his smoking habit, but it was hard for either of them to stay upset for long. He loved the look on her face when he brought her flowers. She loved the sound of him singing mariachi songs after dinner. When the pandemic hit, Rodriguez pushed everyone who was eligible in her family to sign up for vaccinations, though she knew her husband, like many other Latino immigrants, hated seeing the doctor. He once pulled out a rotting tooth on his own instead of visiting a dentist. “When you go to the doctor, that’s when they find something wrong with you,” Reyes, a native of Mexico, would say. And besides, he would add, doctors were expensive. Reyes eventually agreed in July to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, part of a larger success story in Montgomery County, a wealthy but inequitable suburb just outside the District. While vaccine uptake among Latino residents in the county initially trailed that of White residents, outreach from local officials, nonprofit groups and individuals such as Rodriguez helped turn the tide. By August, the vaccination rate among Latinos in Montgomery was higher than any other demographic group, including White residents. As the pandemic dragged on, however, immunity waned. Guided by the CDC, county officials initially offered optional booster shots to the elderly and the infirm before shifting tack and pushing to get everyone boosted. Barely a third of Latino residents in Montgomery had gotten their additional shot when omicron arrived. In later months, the county would blame the federal government for “counterproductive” messaging that made the booster seem less important than it was. At the most recent peak of covid-19 deaths, the mortality rate among residents who had not been boosted was seven times that of those who had. Grace Rivera Oven, a founder of a nonprofit that serves immigrant communities in Montgomery, said many of the poor residents she works with haven’t gotten boosted because they can’t afford the time or are unconvinced it’s worthwhile. “Imagine you’re working two jobs and driving Uber on your time off,” she said. “To find time in the day for a shot” is “just not doable.”







Reyes was due for his booster in December when he developed a persistent cough. Rodriguez asked him to see a doctor, but he resisted. “Latino men are always like that,” Rodriguez thought to herself at the time. “Stubborn.”

She kept trying until one afternoon in January when she was cleaning a client’s home and saw Reyes lean against a wall, his eyes closed. She asked if he was okay, and he shook his head. By the time the ambulance arrived, Reyes was weeping. He couldn’t see, he told his wife.

“I don’t know why she called you,” Reyes said to the medics as they heaved him onto a gurney. “I don’t want to go, please.” He reached for Rodriguez. “Don’t let them take me,” he said.

In the months before he fell sick, Reyes had talked about retiring in a village outside Choluteca, the place in Honduras where Rodriguez grew up. They saved up money and bought a small piece of land there. It was a place they owned for the first time in their lives. They could raise goats and grow avocados, they told their children.

But Reyes didn’t make it to Choluteca. By the time he got to the hospital, inflammation from covid-19 had started to cripple his vital organs, doctors said. Reyes was brain dead within hours. Two days later, Rodriguez watched from behind a glass panel as nurses unplugged his life support. He was 72.

Rodriguez sold the land in Choluteca and emptied her savings to pay for a funeral and a gravesite. She no longer plans to move to Honduras or to retire anymore. Without Reyes, she said, she sees no point.

The racial divide

When a radio show host asked Leonder “Rico” Jerome for his thoughts on the vaccines during a roundtable with Black barbers and health experts in June, Jerome answered honestly that he was conflicted.

Although he was there to discuss an initiative to encourage Black people to take the shot, Jerome, 48, was torn between the news he consumed on vaccine efficacy and his distrust of the pharmaceutical companies that developed the shots.

“Being a man of ebony hue, you’ve seen the Tuskegee experiments, you’ve seen so many different things. To tell me you’re not going to be paranoid is a lie,” Jerome said on the program, adding that he was not vaccinated. “My percentages have been getting higher to get” vaccinated, he added, “but I’m still deep in prayer.”

Three months later, his symptoms emerged. As slight discomfort devolved into a fever, his loved ones urged him to seek medical help. Within weeks, Jerome was placed on life support for pneumonia complications from covid-19.

As District lawmakers and residents tangled over the merits of masking and vaccination mandates, Jerome spent the next three months in different hospitals, healing from surgeries on his lungs and kidneys. Even though he had no underlying health conditions, doctors told his sister, Ebony Ellison, that she should start making end-of-life plans. Jerome had a 3 percent chance of survival.

“They said if he was vaccinated, he would not be on life support,” Ellison said, remembering the conversations she had with her brother about vaccination. “He would talk about syphilis and Tuskegee, but I didn’t go into it with him. Trying to convince someone, especially when you’re the youngest sibling, you give up the fight.”

Health experts and advocates in the District say the case of Jerome is emblematic of the vaccine hesitancy and distrust they’ve frequently encountered among Black residents, who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic at every stage.

Black residents accounted for an overwhelming majority of the more than 100 coronavirus deaths over the last three months in the District, said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for health and human services. Of those, 3 in 4 were unvaccinated, 1 in 5 had some doses but lacked a booster shot, and 9 in 10 suffered from an underlying condition, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.







“When omicron came, and we found you needed a booster, you had to almost start over,” said Tuckson of the Black Coalition Against Covid. “There was not only hardening of misinformation in too much of Black America and the anti-vaccine community, but we also had people that were tired.”

For some Black residents, he said, vaccine distrust is intertwined with frustration over other issues such as police brutality, racism and voter disenfranchisement. For Jerome and some of his friends, that hesitation stems from the country’s racist history, including leaders who once considered his ancestors to be three-fifths of a person and the Tuskegee study. That trepidation has only been intensified by posts on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook that raise doubts over the safety of the vaccines.

The District has used a mix of financial incentives and interventions to reduce gaps in vaccination rates. But Turnage warned of a “tremendous level of misinformation” across social media that continues to influence Black residents.

“There are great reasons to be angry and bitter about Tuskegee, but the issue was people denied access to drugs that could have saved them. In this case, for some odd reason, we deny access to ourselves to the drug that would save us, as some type of protest,” Tuckson said.

In December, as the omicron variant sent more unvaccinated residents into city hospitals, Jerome was released. Doctors described his recovery as a miracle. He feels more pressure now to get vaccinated, he said, but is still undecided.

The location divide

Larry Sturgill, 62, knew many in his town who had died of covid-19, but even as cases surged in his part of southwest Virginia, it never occurred to him to get vaccinated. Like he did with other things beyond his control, he put his trust in God.

He barely had time for his family, working 12-hour days as an accountant, and his primary-care doctor had retired years ago. Some of his friends had tested positive even after getting vaccinated, which made Sturgill skeptical of the effectiveness of the shots. And when he was on YouTube listening to gospel music or to sermons from the late Christian evangelist Billy Graham, videos sometimes popped up of users swearing that the vaccines had dangerous side effects.

Many others shared his view in Wise County, where less than half the population was vaccinated when omicron arrived. Sturgill’s wife hadn’t gotten the shot and neither had his younger brother, who lived across the border in Tennessee but worked with him in Wise.

Scott Sturgill, 49, used Twitter to follow news on Tennessee football and occasionally came across tweets that made him question the coronavirus vaccines. The users behind these tweets weren’t people he knew and didn’t seem like medical professionals. But what they said stuck in his head anyway. Whenever his wife, who has asthma, tried persuading him to get the shot, he gave the same response, “I’ll think about it.”







Virginia officials have struggled over the last year to shore up vaccination rates in the rural southwest region of the state, where residents tend to be sicker, more skeptical of government and harder to reach. Some have responded to appeals from local health workers, said Beth O’Connor, chief executive of the Virginia Rural Health Association. But such spokespeople are rare. Swaths of the region, including all of Wise, are federally considered “health professional shortage areas.”

The Sturgill brothers waited until their coughs got too severe to work before visiting the Health Wagon, a mobile clinic. When they tested positive for the coronavirus, they tried to recover on their own until Tyson, who leads the clinic, called them each an ambulance and insisted that they go.

It was the first time either of them had ever been hospitalized. Scott stayed in isolation at Pikeville Medical Center in Kentucky for 16 days. Larry stayed for 10. Drifting in and out of consciousness, Larry said he thought about his grandchildren, ages 4 and 2. “Knowing that I might not be there for them,” he said one recent afternoon, his voice still hoarse, “I can only describe as tough.”

Scott came out of the hospital in worse shape than his brother. He struggled for weeks to walk and speak, and doctors told him the scarring on his lungs was so severe that he might have trouble breathing for the rest of his life. “It’s really messed me up. It really has,” he said in February, wheezing as he took breaths from an oxygen machine. If he could go back in time, he said, he would get vaccinated. He planned to do so once doctors said he could. His brother, however, hadn’t made up his mind. Even though southwest Virginia saw more coronavirus deaths in February than in any other month during the pandemic, vaccination rates in the region continue to show only incremental increases. “At this point, everyone here knows somebody who has died of covid,” said Tyson, who has been pleading with her patients to get vaccinated. “I’m at a loss of words to explain why people are still so resistant.” One afternoon in March, Scott Sturgill got a text message from his brother’s wife. Larry Sturgill’s oxygen levels had plunged again, she told him. They were on their way back to the hospital. Teo Armus contributed to this report. Design by Marissa Vonesh.

China’s worst coronavirus outbreak in two years has reached almost all parts of the country, stretching medical resources, shuttering businesses and manufacturing outfits, and raising questions about the government’s staunch commitment to its “zero covid” policy. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight On Wednesday, health officials reported 3,054 domestic coronavirus cases, lower than the day before, when authorities posted the country’s largest daily toll since 2020 of 5,154 local infections — still small numbers, compared with most other large countries but dramatic increases for China.

As of Tuesday, at least 28 of the country’s 31 provinces and regions had reported new coronavirus cases, mostly of the BA.2 version of the omicron variant. More than half of the new cases have been in the northeastern province of Jilin, where officials said they had enough medical supplies for only two or three more days.

China is particularly vulnerable to the fast-spreading omicron variant. Although more than 85 percent of the population is vaccinated, Chinese vaccines have not proved to be as effective against the variant, compared with the mRNA vaccines — such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — used elsewhere, which are still under production and not yet available in the country.

China’s large elderly population is especially at risk. More than 50 million people in the country older than 60 are not fully vaccinated, according to a briefing by the National Health Commission on Tuesday, raising worries that if the outbreak is not controlled China could suffer the same fate as neighboring Hong Kong where more than 4,500 have died — the vast majority elderly who weren’t fully vaccinated.

Lockdown measures in major manufacturing hubs and ports such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dongguan also threaten to harm global supply chains and China’s economic recovery after senior officials pledged to expand growth to about 5.5 percent this year.

On Tuesday, the country’s economic czar Liu He cautioned that under the “complex situation,” pandemic measures must be balanced with economic and social development to “keep the economy operating within a reasonable range” and maintaining stable capital markets — a possible reference to how the draconian lockdown measures used previously could affect the economy.

A report from Bank of America Securities said the outbreak could hit global supply chains for Android smartphones and affect the production of chips, apparel and cars in the near term. Although most Chinese ports remain open, shipping analysts have documented congestion with dozens of containers waiting outside ports in Qingdao and Shenzhen while U.S. electric car maker Tesla said in a memo that it was suspending production at its factory in Shanghai for two days, according to Reuters.

The outbreak has coincided with a sell-off in Chinese stocks this week, followed by a rebound Wednesday after Liu pledged to support industries under pressure.

Complaints from regular citizens have appeared with more regularity on the country’s heavily policed social media platforms. One user wrote Monday on the microblog Weibo that because of the sudden new lockdown measures, their family was trapped on a highway for 14 hours trying to reach the town of Wuxi in eastern China.

News that a 4-year-old girl in Changchun, one of the cities under strict lockdown, had died of acute laryngitis while waiting for a negative coronavirus test to go to the hospital prompted further anger online.

“Three years. I don’t dare get sick, and don’t even talk about having children. You don’t know what they might face,” one Internet user wrote under a hashtag for the issue that had been viewed more than 40 million times in two hours.

Others complained about losses to their businesses. “I really broke down tonight and have never wanted to leave Shenzhen as much as I do tonight. Since I opened my shop on March 1, I haven’t made a single penny,” read one widely viewed comment in response to a post on WeChat by the Shenzhen Health Commission.

As the lockdowns strain the economy and test the patience of residents, there are signs officials may be gradually inching away from the “dynamic zero covid” policy of trying to eliminate the virus through hard lockdowns, aggressive contact tracing and maintenance of tight border controls.

Patients with mild symptoms no longer need to be hospitalized but are instead being sent to centralized quarantine centers, officials said Tuesday. Officials in Shanghai, where schools have been shut, said they were not planning to institute a citywide lockdown.

Apple supplier Foxconn, which halted operations Monday in Shenzhen, said Wednesday that it had implemented a “closed-loop” system and had resumed some production. The Yantian Port in Shenzhen on Monday said that it was still operating normally.

But many provinces and cities are still implementing controls as strictly as before. Almost 36 million people in towns and cities from Hebei province to Shenzhen have been restricted to their homes or housing compounds. Key industrial hubs such as Dongguan, Changchun, Jilin city and Shenzhen have placed their residents under “closed management,” forcing businesses and factories to suspend operations.

Many more areas have implemented less stringent restrictions on movement between provinces. Flights going into Shanghai will be diverted to other cities from March 21 until May 1. All those entering Beijing must undergo a nucleic acid (PCR) test 72 hours after arrival, on top of having a negative coronavirus test within the past 48 hours.

In Tianjin, like in many cities, residents have been ordered not to leave for nonessential travel. In Shanghai, those who must leave the city, as well as those entering the city, must show a negative nucleic acid test taken in the past 48 hours.

Despite signs of wavering, China has officially promised to continue its zero-covid policy. Lei Zhenglong, deputy head of the National Health Commission’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency published Wednesday that experts have judged the current zero-covid policy to be effective against the omicron variant, even though the BA.2 version was spreading faster and undetected. He said the nature of the current outbreak requires “our prevention and control measures to be earlier, faster, stricter and more effective.”

The Biden administration released a comprehensive plan last week that’s been widely applauded — including by me — as a sound, evidence-based path out of the covid-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, it can’t be executed without additional coronavirus funding. Those opposed should be heard, but this process must not delay Congress’s approval of the White House’s $22.5 billion request.

“Nearly all” previously allocated funding has been used, according to the White House. The achievements accomplished by these resources are impressive: ensuring that more than 215 million Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, purchasing 1.2 billion doses of vaccines for global distribution, ordering an initial 20 million courses of antiviral pills, securing 1 billion coronavirus tests to be distributed free to Americans, and other efforts in response to the delta and omicron surges.

Now, the White House is asking Congress for additional funding to purchase more vaccines and treatments, maintain existing testing capability and prepare for future variants.

This is a reasonable request. The resources approved in the past were never expected to cover pandemic costs in perpetuity. As the virus evolves, the response has to as well. We now have a road map to keep covid-19 under control; surely it makes sense to fully fund it.

Another way to think about this is to consider the consequences of not providing supplemental funding. Our supply of monoclonal antibodies will run out as early as May, an administration official told me, unless additional orders are placed soon. By July, the federal government expects to be out of Evusheld — a preventative antibody therapy to protect the immunocompromised that is already in short supply.

In addition, more oral antiviral treatments need to be ordered soon, or other countries could outcompete the United States for limited supplies. Early treatment depends on widely accessible testing. According to the administration official, as many as 11,500 free testing locations could shutter in the spring unless additional funding is forthcoming. And there won’t be resources to develop, purchase or distribute vaccines should new variants arise.

These are worst-case scenarios that we shouldn’t even have to contemplate. Early in the pandemic, Americans died because we didn’t have vaccines or effective treatments. Later surges were complicated by insufficient testing. Now, we have the scientific capability to protect against infection and to prevent severe disease. How tragic would it be if Americans continued to suffer and die simply because elected officials refused to provide needed resources?

Democratic lawmakers are expected to fold the covid-19 request into a major spending bill that includes support for Ukraine. But three dozen Republican senators have signaled that they may be unwilling to approve the coronavirus aid. In a March 2 letter to the White House led by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), they noted that nearly $6 trillion has already been allocated for pandemic relief. That amount covered stimulus checks, rental relief, child tax credits, unemployment support, and grants to state and local governments, among many other priorities. The senators cited a lack of transparency on spending and called for better accounting of funds, including exact expenditures by the federal government, disbursements to state and local jurisdictions, and metrics of effectiveness.

These Republicans are justifiably concerned. In December, the U.S. Secret Service uncovered that criminals stole nearly $100 billion in pandemic relief funds. A Post investigation published in February revealed “immense fraud” and inadequate safeguards attributable to the huge influx of funding relative to limited watchdog capabilities.

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said last week that he thinks “there’s just a general belief that there’s a lot of money out there still floating around. And that before we put more out, we need to get an accounting for that.” I agree with him and his colleagues that there needs to be much better oversight of federal funds. The Biden administration owes the American people a thorough, public investigation of the resources spent thus far. They must prosecute those who committed fraud and set up mechanisms to prevent future misuse.

But just because previous funding could have been better managed doesn’t mean that current resources should be held hostage. Investigations may eventually recover unaccounted-for funds, but we can’t afford to delay sustaining covid-19 efforts. Moreover, $22.5 billion is a drop in the bucket out of the nearly $6 trillion primarily spent on reducing the harm of the pandemic — it’s foolish to withhold what amounts to 0.36 percent of the total aid. The right solution would be for Congress to demand retrospective accounting and additional safeguards going forward, while also treating this new funding request with the urgency it plainly deserves.

The darkest days of the pandemic should be behind us. We have seen the devastation wrought by covid-19 and finally have the tools to prevent it from happening again. Few decisions in front of Congress are so straightforward: pay $22.5 billion now or risk far more in both economic damages and loss of life.

Worldwide deaths from covid-19 surpassed 6 million on Monday, a grim reminder of the coronavirus’s lethality as many countries relax mask-wearing and vaccination requirements. Even as vaccination rates rose in parts of the world, the daily average of covid deaths stood at 9,000 during the past 28 days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

About 4 percent of all covid deaths worldwide were recorded in the past month.

“The idea we would get to 6 million is really inconceivable when I think back to two years ago,” said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention organization that also advocates for global coronavirus vaccine equity. “Everything that has happened in the last 12 months, though, is a marker of our inability of translating the remarkable scientific progress, the remarkable product development into impact.”

Experts say the 6 million total — the first deaths from the virus were reported in early 2020 — is most probably an undercount and that the public should remain on guard.

Some developing countries don’t maintain registries of vital statistics, or their testing resources are limited, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“I think there’s a real danger in getting complacent about it, and there’s a risk that as the numbers pile up, you begin to see them as just numbers as opposed to human lives lost,” Nuzzo said.

In Hong Kong, she said, the health system is being overwhelmed by the omicron variant of the virus and “because they have a lot of unvaccinated elderly.”

The omicron wave arrived in Asia and Eastern Europe later than in other parts of the world, and the coronavirus indicators are now higher in those regions, Nuzzo added.

And the United States is not yet out of the woods.

“Americans need to understand the sooner we get the world vaccinated, the better it will be,” said Carlos del Rio, global health professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. “We are still seeing over 1,000 deaths a day in the U.S. That’s an unacceptably high number.”

Multiple scientific studies have shown that the unvaccinated are more likely to suffer worse health outcomes from covid-19 — including harsher symptoms and higher rates of hospitalization and death — than people who receive the shots.

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 76.5 percent of the U.S. population had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 65 percent had received a full course, as of Sunday.

The segment of the U.S. population that has declined vaccination has been largely unshakable, according to surveys from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Liz Hamel, Kaiser Family Foundation director of public opinion and polling research, said “hardcore refusers” consistently make up 12 percent to 16 percent of people in polls since the foundation began monitoring vaccine attitudes.

“While we see a decrease in the share that say they’re on the fence — the ‘wait and see’ category — and while we’ve seen a slight decrease in the people who say they’ll get it if required, that group of hardcore refusers has been very consistent since the beginning,” Hamel said, and it is “mainly a group that identified as Republicans.”

“Being a Republican has become an even stronger predictor of being unvaccinated over time,” she said.

On Feb. 25, the CDC issued updated guidance for state and local officials and the public, recommending that masks be worn in public only in counties with relatively high case counts and overburdened hospitals. Almost all states had relaxed their indoor mask-wearing requirements by the time the guidance was released.

Nearly 960,000 people in the United States have died of covid, according to tracking by The Washington Post, representing almost 1 of every 6 covid deaths globally.

No matter where it happens on the map, the more the virus spreads, the more likely new variants are to emerge, said Aditi Nerurkar, a Harvard Medical School physician and lecturer on global health. The omicron variant was first detected in southern Africa late last year and quickly spread to other continents, leading to a resurgent wave of the pandemic.

Nerurkar said the new global death total showed that the United States cannot declare victory against the pandemic while the virus continues to spread across an under-vaccinated globe.

Coronavirus indicators already were relatively high in Eastern Europe before Russia invaded Ukraine. Nerurkar said global conflicts historically have accelerated the spread of infectious diseases. Researchers say the 1918-1919 flu pandemic was worsened by global movements during World War I.

“If you start relaxing masking, removing vaccine passport requirements, that translates to people’s daily lives, and they start believing the pandemic is over because all of these changes are happening,” Nerurkar said. “And that’s such a stark difference from what’s really happening.”

Gavi, an alliance of international organizations promoting global vaccine equity, said the latest fatality milestone highlights how the pandemic is far from over when billions have not received a shot.

“What is needed now is concerted action to turn vaccines into vaccinations as rapidly as possible, and to put funding in place so that lower-income countries do not again find themselves at the back of the queue when it comes to procuring vaccines in the future,” Gavi said in a statement.

Reader: Last summer I became very ill with covid-19. I was a few months into a new dream job at a global company that emphasizes its progressive culture. After I was diagnosed, I continued to work from home until I became unable. I was hospitalized, spending a week in a medically induced coma and two weeks in the ICU.

Less than two weeks after my hospital stay, I received the doctor’s approval to return to work. On my first day back, my manager called me into his office and explained that my absence was “very bad timing” and my leadership role within the team had “come to an end.” I was also told to “act like an intern” and that my advancement within the company was “off the table.” I have over 15 years of leadership experience and an MBA from a top university, and there was no hint that I wasn’t excelling in my new role before my illness.

Hoping to win back my manager’s trust, I’ve kept my head down, executed my work, and gone above and beyond what’s asked of me for the past several months. My manager insults, berates, humiliates and criticizes me at every turn.

I love my job but loathe going to work. I hesitate to quit and lose my insurance. Is there any advice on how to deal with this situation, or is it time to meet with HR and move on?

Karla: Judging by other letters I’ve received, yours isn’t the only employer contending with the challenges of reintegrating workers returning from covid-related leave. But it is a prime example of how not to handle those challenges.

I want to believe that by “bad timing,” your boss merely meant your illness occurred at a time that was especially unfortunate for the business as well as for you — not that you personally exercised bad judgment in getting sick. But assuming your account is accurate, the only reasonable interpretation is that you’re being punished for taking time off to survive a virus that is on the verge of killing 1 million people in the United States.

The Family and Medical Leave Act allows eligible workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to be treated for and recover from a serious health condition that renders them unable to work. And as discussed in a previous column, workers returning from FMLA leave must be restored to a position that is the same as or equivalent to the job they held before.

Unfortunately, FMLA applies only to employees who have been at the employer at least one year, so you don’t have that protection. But other laws — such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, state and local leave and disability laws, and new laws enacted specifically to protect covid victims — may come into play, according to Amy Epstein Gluck, employment law partner with FisherBroyles.

My layperson’s guess is that your employer knows all this and has assigned you a degrading position with no future, hoping it will encourage you to leave voluntarily.

But you have options other than submitting to abuse or slinking off into the night. An employment lawyer can determine what non-FMLA protections you’re entitled to and possibly help you negotiate a good severance package to carry you through your next job search. Check your state’s bar association or visit the National Employment Lawyers Association (nela.org) to find a lawyer and schedule a consultation.

To be fair, I have to believe most employers are more humane than yours and are trying to do right by their returning workers. The pandemic has left a lot of business owners struggling with severe workforce losses — some due to covid, some to the “Great Resignation” — requiring them to change their operational structures or make painful cuts.

For some workers returning from covid leave, their old jobs may have changed significantly or may no longer exist. Workers suffering from mental and physical aftereffects and long-haul covid may now need accommodations that are difficult to implement given their employers’ reduced resources.

In addition to considering the laws mentioned above, says Epstein Gluck, employers should “be consistent, follow reasonable accommodation, request appropriate documentation and engage in an interactive process” with employees to determine what their condition is, what their challenges and capabilities are, and what accommodations might allow them to perform their jobs. Everyone’s anxious for economic recovery — but human recovery is a vital part of that goal.

A senior executive at Estée Lauder is being forced to step down after sharing a racist meme about the coronavirus on Instagram that the company said has caused “widespread offense.” John Demsey, executive group president of the Estée Lauder Cos., was told to leave the cosmetics giant, effective this week, after posting a meme spoofing a “Sesame Street” children’s book cover. The meme, which showed Big Bird wearing a surgical mask while standing at a sick Snuffleupagus’s bedside, used a redacted version of the n-word in the title while stating that Snuffy had contracted the coronavirus at a Chingy concert. The post has been removed.

Demsey did not immediately respond to a request for comment but issued an apology on social media.

Estée Lauder said in a statement Monday that Demsey’s post had been “damaging to our efforts to drive inclusivity both inside and outside our walls, and do not reflect the judgment we expect of our leaders.”

“Inclusion, diversity and equity are core to our company’s values and priorities globally,” Estée Lauder Cos. leaders William P. Lauder, executive chairman, and Fabrizio Freda, president and CEO, said in the statement. “Furthermore, over the past two years, we have worked together as an organization to advance our approach to racial equity and have taken a hard look at where we can and should do better. Together we are making progress against our commitments to our employees, our partners, and consumers.

“Our employees, and especially our senior leaders, are accountable to continue driving our progress and to respect the values of this company for the long term.”

Estée Lauder, among a number of other well-known companies, has worked to address race-related issues in the workplace, particularly in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed in 2020 by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. At the time, Estée Lauder vowed to increase the number of employees of color at all levels within the company and ensure that its products meet the diverse needs of consumers of color, among other things.

After Demsey posted the meme last week, he was placed on unpaid leave before being told to go.

On Saturday — days before the company’s most recent announcement — he issued an apology on Instagram.

“I am terribly sorry and deeply ashamed that I hurt so many people when I made the horrible mistake of carelessly reposting a racist meme without reading it beforehand. There are not enough words to express my remorse and sorrow,” he wrote.

“Not only did I hurt many people whom I respect, the terrible mistake that I made has undermined everything I have been working for since I began my career 31 years ago. The meme is the furthest thing from what I stand for and I should have never reposted it.

“I am so sorry that I let down the Company that I have dedicated my life’s work to as well as its employees, artists, friends, and colleagues. I hope that in time people will judge me, not for this awful mistake, but for my lifetime of words and actions, which demonstrate my respect for all people.”

For centuries, Christians have met in sacred places that also provided safety for those seeking asylum, including runaway slaves and undocumented immigrants. But those same sanctuaries where many sing and embrace each other have become anxiety-inducing, and possibly dangerous, for many Americans who are considered higher risk for covid-19. More than 7 million Americans have weakened immune systems that make them more vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus and can make covid-19 more deadly. Many have chosen to stay home. Those who are immunocompromised include people with medical conditions that weaken their immune response, as well as people taking immune-suppressing drugs because of cancer, organ transplants or autoimmune diseases.

As states across the country are lifting covid-19 precautions such as mask mandates and some churches have dropped online services, the immunocompromised are weighing their risk of possible exposure in worship services. And some are finding their fellow parishioners and church leaders aren’t taking measures to protect them.

Andrea Ramsey was attending a nondenominational church in D.C. where, before the pandemic, she was asked to speak in church about living with a chronic illness that prevents her from working. Ramsey has Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which causes problems with her immune system.

Ramsey’s church had formed small online groups during the early months of the pandemic that became a lifeline for her, but leaders stopped the groups in 2021 to encourage people to worship in person.

“When they cut the home groups, it felt like, wait a minute, this place that cared for me and my situation was trying to move on without us,” said Ramsey, who is 44.

Her church initially required masks but many would ignore the mandate.

“I have been in church situations where I’m accused of not having enough faith,” she said. “I never got that sense from this church. It was when we were a year and a half into things I was noticing, we are not talking about vaccination from the pulpit. We’re not enforcing mask mandates.”

She said other things led her to recently leave her church, but the way the leaders treated covid-19 caused her to lose trust.

“They had a greeting time at a gathering and said, ‘Come on, you can hug each other, we don’t need to be afraid,’” she said. “That pissed me off. We don’t need to be afraid, but we need to be careful. It was one of the incidents that cemented in my mind that it’s not going to be a safe place for me.”

Those who are immunocompromised are not a monolith and experience different degrees of immunosuppression that could impact their response to the virus, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Someone who has cancer like lymphoma and doesn’t respond well to the coronavirus vaccine, for example, is likely at higher risk than someone on an immunosuppressive drug for something like Crohn’s disease.

Also, many circumstances have changed since the early days of the pandemic, Bhattacharya said. Vaccinations tend not to provide the same level of antibodies to someone who is immunosuppressed as they would for someone else, but they still reduce chances of the person getting sick or becoming seriously ill. High-quality masks like N95 masks, which are more effective than cloth ones, are more available. Doctors have access to newer treatments, though some have been in shorter supply.

Bhattacharya said he doesn’t like to think about whether something is “safe” or not. Instead, he encourages people to consider their range of risk. He encourages people to ask questions, including:

How important is the activity to you? What is the community transmission rate? Does the building have good ventilation? What are things you can do to reduce the chances of getting infected, like wearing a high-quality mask? Can you ask your doctor before possible infection if the doctor has access to drugs like Paxlovid or Sotrovimab?

“People are reassessing their own risk tolerance for different activities,” he said. “I don’t feel comfortable saying what they should or shouldn’t do. There are things you can do to reduce your risk, knowing there is risk.”

Many people who are immunosuppressed still choose to attend in-person services, including Jaye Maxey Sanchez, 19, who has been visiting Baptist and nondenominational churches in her new town of San Marcos, where she is a freshman at Texas State University. Sanchez has arthritis, fibromyalgia and gastroparesis, and is on medicine that suppresses her immune system. Her rheumatologist, who is a Christian, hasn’t discouraged her from attending services.

Sanchez said she used to wear a mask in church but decided to stop because no one else would wear one, and the people she attends with are friends she spends time with during the week anyway.

“If I wore a mask, people might think I was contagious or sick,” she said. “I feel normal wearing a mask to school. But because people don’t wear them to church, it feels a little weird.”

Raised in a Christian home, church has long been an important source of community for her. She contracted and recovered from covid-19 in early January during a church retreat where she thinks she got it while removing her mask to eat and drink.

“Sometimes I wish we would mask in seasons where the flu is high too and everyone is getting sick so we could be protecting each other. Because Texas is so conservative, that changes the churches,” she said. “I think when people think about the vaccines and masks, they think about themselves, not about doing it to protect other people, too.”

Others have stayed away from in-person services entirely. Tory Cross, 28, who has asthma and is on medication that makes her immunocompromised, said her pulmonologist cautioned her against attending services, so she hasn’t gone in person since the pandemic started. Just two years before, she had found her ideal church. After exploring the Catholic tradition, she began attending an Episcopal church in San Francisco in 2018 that fit her progressive values.

“I wanted a community that would hold my queerness. It felt very safe, like a place I could belong. I spent time in the AIDS memorial chapel thinking about queer ancestors,” she said. “I never got to go back.”

Cross moved to D.C. in the summer of 2021, and with the District’s mask mandate lifting soon, she’s wary of finding a new church.

“I have been too scared to try,” she said.

The Episcopal Diocese of Washington has a universal restriction against using the common chalice that holds wine for Communion, but otherwise it allows leaders to follow local guidelines on whether to require masks and other public health measures, said Bishop Mariann Budde. She says she has heard from people all over the spectrum and allows the clergy to make decisions based on their community needs.

Budde said she wants to create as safe of an environment as possible, but “we cannot create a perfectly safe environment for immunocompromised people. We can’t dictate our entire congregations based on that one population. We have to serve everyone,” Budde said. “We have to allow those who are compromised to make their own decisions.”

Trying to make accommodations for everyone has been tricky, said Jon Saur, pastor of a Presbyterian (USA) Church in Simi Valley, Calif. Saur said he understands what it’s like for immunocompromised folks since he has been on an immune suppressing medication for rheumatoid arthritis since he was 18.

“It’s better to be one step too cautious than one step too risky. That’s guided everything,” said Saur, who is 38. “I know there are people who are in the same position I’m in and looking around and saying, the church I’ve been going to doesn’t understand what my life looks like.”

His church follows local county guidelines, so the church will move to mask optional for those who are vaccinated soon, though he said he plans to continue holding an outdoor service through the pandemic.

He wears a double KN95 mask and asks staff to wear masks so that someone in the back doesn’t have to feel uncomfortable if they are the only ones doing so.

“We have people who are attached to the sanctuary,” he said. “Some people have been here 60 or 70 years. We try to make it as safe as possible so they can be in that space.”

When her teenage son was diagnosed with cancer as a child, members of Rachel Gillen’s Lutheran church in Fargo, N.D., would provide meals, buy gift cards and send presents. As a transplant survivor, her son is highly immunosuppressed and has received a fourth dose of a coronavirus vaccine. They have chosen to stay home from church. As Gillen’s community started to get more resistant to wearing masks, people stopped wearing them in church.

“They were supportive of our family when he had cancer,” she said. “But asking people to wear masks so we can attend was asking too much. It’s been painful. It feels a little like losing a side of your family.”

The staff at her church have been accommodating, she said, and they wear masks when she comes into work as an administrative assistant. Leaders asked if they should require masks for youth group, but her son thinks they’ll make the change just for his sake and it would make him feel too self-conscious, so he feels it’s easier not to go at all. The pastor started a monthly mask-mandated service that they tried to attend, but Gillen found mask adherence was so low that they couldn’t risk it.

Her teenagers will watch online services, but she said it’s hard to get much participation in singing or liturgy in a living room.

“According to the teachings of Jesus, churches should be the safest places for the vulnerable to be,” she said. “It hasn’t been the case in the pandemic, and that’s been hard. I worry about a lasting impact that could have on my kids. And me. On any of us.”

The 94th Academy Awards will require nominees and guests in the Dolby Theatre audience to show proof of covid-19 vaccination and two negative PCR tests, according to a person with knowledge of the March 27 ceremony. The vaccine mandate won’t extend to performers and presenters, who will still be required to undergo testing.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ decision was first reported Thursday by the New York Times, which noted that the organization came to its decision after “much internal discussion” and in response to safety protocols and standards set by Los Angeles County. Of the 2,500 people invited to sit in the Oscars audience, according to the Times, those in the “orchestra and parterre” sections will not be asked to wear masks.

Last week, the Hollywood Reporter stated that the academy was not planning to require vaccinations at all and would instead only require a negative PCR or rapid antigen test taken the day of the ceremony. A representative for the academy did not respond to The Washington Post’s request for comment on that report.

Netflix’s “The Power of the Dog” collected 12 Academy Award nominations on Feb. 8, including those for best picture and best director. (Video: Allie Caren/The Washington Post)

Upcoming ceremonies hosted by Hollywood unions — including the Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild of America and the Producers Guild of America — will require proof of vaccination, according to Deadline.

This year’s Oscars mark a return to form; not only will it more closely resemble the pre-pandemic era physically — last year’s took place at Los Angeles’s Union Station — but it will also have a host for the first time since 2018. Three hosts, in fact, and all with comedic backgrounds: Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes.

Oscars ratings plunged to an all-time low last year, attracting an average of just 9.85 million viewers throughout the telecast — a 58 percent drop from the previous ceremony. This time around, the academy enlisted producer Will Packer, known for 2017′s “Girls Trip,” to liven things up and try to attract a wider audience.

In a recent academy news release, Packer said there would be “many surprises in store! Expect the unexpected!”

A pair of whistleblower complaints filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month allege Facebook misled investors about its efforts to combat climate change and covid-19 misinformation, according to redacted copies of the documents viewed by The Washington Post. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Filed by Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit representing former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, the complaints allege that the company made “material misrepresentations and omissions in statements to investors” about its efforts to combat misinformation. The complaints, which have not been previously reported, build on Haugen’s congressional testimony and filings her lawyers submitted to the financial regulator last year, and they draw from thousands of internal documents that she took before leaving the company in May.

One complaint alleges that climate change misinformation was prominently available on Facebook and that the company lacked a clear policy on the issue as recently as last year, despite Facebook executives’ committing to fight the “global crisis” during earnings calls. A second, companion complaint argues that while Facebook executives were publicly touting their efforts to remove harmful covid misinformation, internal documents “paint a different story.” The complaint cites internal company communications about the spread of vaccine hesitancy in comments and internal surveys that showed the proliferation of covid misinformation on the service.

“Some investors simply will not want to invest in a company that fails to adequately address such misinformation and then engages in misstatements and omissions on the topic,” one complaint says.

Facebook rebranded itself as Meta last year, after Haugen left the company and went public as a whistleblower. The company continues to remove false claims about vaccines and has worked to elevate “authoritative information” about climate change and public health, Meta spokesman Drew Pusateri said.

“There are no one-size-fits-all solutions to stopping the spread of misinformation, but we’re committed to building new tools and policies to combat it,” Pusateri told The Post in a statement.

For years, Democrats have criticized social networks over what they argue is a negligent approach to misinformation about public health, democracy and the environment. The White House last year pressured Facebook to do more to address vaccine misinformation, a push that culminated in President Biden telling reporters “they’re killing people.” But despite public fireworks, policymakers and regulators in the interim have taken little action to rein in the proliferation of falsehoods online, in part because many proposals targeting misinformation risk running afoul of the First Amendment.

Haugen’s lawyers have sidestepped this concern by focusing their complaints on corporate interests: whether the company has lied to investors.

Nathaniel Persily, a professor at Stanford Law School and director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, called the strategy a “creative” approach to the problem. “You cannot pass a law in the U.S. banning disinformation,” Persily said. “So what can you do? You can hold the platforms accountable to promises they make. Those promises could be made to users, to the government, to shareholders.”

While the SEC has not publicly commented on the status of Haugen’s complaints, the agency has signaled a “very strong enforcement stance” under Democratic Chairman Gary Gensler, said Jane Norberg, who headed the SEC’s whistleblower program until April and is now a partner at Arnold & Porter, a law firm that specializes in business regulation. (Haugen sought whistleblower protection from the SEC, which could shield her from retaliation by Facebook.) The agency has been broadly clear that companies need to make clear and accurate disclosures to investors, Norberg said.

“If the company says one thing to investors, but internal documents show that what they were saying is untrue, that could be something the SEC would look at,” she said.

The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the complaints.

A congressional staffer shared redacted versions of the SEC complaints with a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post. The complaints cite confidential documents, originally collected by Haugen, also shared with the consortium.

The climate change complaint, filed with the SEC on Feb. 7, cites records that show employees internally grappling with the company’s perceived role in spreading climate misinformation. In a document from the first quarter of 2021, an employee said they searched for “climate change” in the social network’s Watch tab. The second result was a piece of “climate misinfo,” the employee wrote, and had been viewed more than 6.6 million times.

Advertisement

Another employee working on Facebook’s search integrity called for the company to do more to address climate denialism. “Can we take it a step farther and start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from our platforms,” they wrote.

The complaint also cites internal records about the platform’s Climate Science Information Center, a much-touted hub designed to connect people with authoritative climate information. Awareness of the webpage was “very low,” even for people who had visited it.

“Climate change knowledge is generally poor,” one of the internal reports from 2021 said. “Given how many people use Facebook for information about climate change … climate science myths are a problem across all surveyed markets.”

The filings argue that it’s particularly urgent that Facebook tackle climate change misinformation, in part because of the popularity of the site. An internal company document cited in the complaint says Facebook is the second-most common source for news related to climate change, behind only television news and ahead of news aggregators, movies, online climate news sources and other social media platforms.

Advertisement

The company adds information labels to some posts about climate change, and it reduces distribution of posts that its fact-checking partners rate as false. But it generally does not remove those posts, as it does with certain false claims about vaccines and the coronavirus. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, called the company’s approach “disturbing.”

“Unmitigated climate change is projected to lead to far greater numbers of human fatalities than covid-19,” said Mann, author of “The New Climate War.” “The fact that they’re treating greater threat with so much less urgency and care is problematic.”

Pusateri, the Meta spokesman, said that misinformation makes up a small amount of climate change content in the company’s apps, and that it spikes periodically, such as during extreme weather events. He said the company has taken steps to make it easier for fact-checkers to find climate content.

Advertisement

In the other filing, dated Feb. 10, the whistleblower lawyers argue that internal documents showing the spread of covid misinformation contradict the public statements the company has made. An internal Facebook document cited in the complaint shows that in April 2020, the company saw a 20 percent spike in users reporting and seeing false or misleading content. A Facebook employee cites covid as a reason. The complaint cites a May 2020 company record, in which employees warned that hundreds of anti-quarantine groups were active, with many high-ranking comments linking to conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. The SEC complaint also cites an internal Facebook survey, which found 1 in 3 people in the United States said they saw misleading or false information related to covid and voting.

The Washington Post previously reported that coronavirus misinformation was dominating small sections of Facebook’s platform, creating “echo-chamber-like effects” and reinforcing vaccine hesitancy. Other researchers documented how posts by medical authorities, like the World Health Organization, were often swarmed by anti-vaccine commenters. These documents were also cited in the complaint.

The filings are part of Haugen’s team’s broader legal strategy. Her lawyers filed at least eight other complaints last year with the agency based on the trove of company documents. One complaint alleges that the company misled investors about its role in “perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6 insurrection.” Others accused the company of misleading investors about its removal of hate speech and the negative consequences of its algorithms promoting misinformation and hate speech.

Persily, the Stanford law professor, said complaints like this could be a model for how to regulate in the area of content moderation. “It is extremely difficult to enact regulation regarding content moderation because it’s such a fast-moving area,” he said. “If you do hold the platforms to rules that they agree to, that’s a different mode of regulation.”

It’s one of the enduring mysteries of covid-19: Why didn’t the pandemic hit low-income African nations as hard as wealthy countries in North America and Europe? There is no simple answer to that question. But this week, two new studies added to our understanding of it. One suggested that the number of covid-19 cases may be vastly undercounted across the continent; another found good evidence that the number of deaths in at least one country could be significantly undercounted.

Neither study necessarily changes our current big picture understanding of the pandemic — that wealthy countries often saw worse outcomes than developing nations.

However, they could have a big impact on the debate about how and why African nations were forgotten by wealthy nations during the pandemic — especially as the European Union and the African Union meet in a joint summit in Brussels and the World Health Organization pushes for wealthy nations to back a South African facility that aims to share mRNA technology.

“In Africa, 83 percent of people still have not received a single dose,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday at a Vaccine Equity for Africa event in Germany. “This is not only a moral failure, it is also an epidemiological failure, which is creating the ideal conditions for new variants to emerge.”

The coronavirus ravaged almost all corners of the earth, including wealthy nations like the United States and Britain. In Africa, things went differently. The continent “appears to have bucked the doomsday predictions of global health experts,” my colleagues wrote in December 2020.

Even after the fast-spreading omicron variant, first identified in southern Africa late last year, that trend has largely held up. One-fifth of the world’s population lives in Africa, but the continent has accounted for only a tiny sliver of confirmed cases around the world.

Advertisement

According to Our World in Data, as of mid-February, 2.7 percent of all confirmed covid-19 cases were found on the continent. By comparison, North America saw 22 percent of all global cases; Europe more than a third.

But reliable public tracking of new daily covid-19 cases rests on something important: easy access to coronavirus tests and the expensive infrastructure to administer and track their results. Throughout the pandemic, many African nations had neither.

In a preprint study released this week, a team of researchers with WHO backing tried to tackle that problem by looking at available data about people with covid-19 antibodies across the continent. These studies, known as seroprevalence surveys, use bloodwork to show who has some level of immunity to the coronavirus — whether through vaccinations or a previous infection.

The study found that levels of immunity in Africa appeared to be vastly higher than could be explained by official case numbers, even when combined with the continent’s paltry vaccination levels. Every nation surveyed had far higher levels of immunity than official figures showed; Nigeria had a ratio of 958 to 1.

By September 2021, over 65 percent of the continent had some form of immunity to covid-19, the study estimated. This, the authors write, suggests there had not been 8.2 million cases across the continent by that time — but 800 million.

If this was accurate, did no one notice? One possibility, raised by the WHO-backed study, is that many of the cases in Africa may have been asymptomatic — perhaps more than two-thirds. Compared with Europe and North America, most African countries have relatively young populations that are less likely to see serious illness from the coronavirus.

The comparatively low number of deaths recorded from covid-19 across the continent seems to support this idea. Just 4 percent of deaths globally were recorded in Africa, according to Our World in Data.

There are many signs that not all deaths from covid-19 are caught in official figures. Even in the United States, the number of “excess deaths” recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are not directly attributed to covid-19 is roughly 100,000.

Most African nations do not collect the data needed to estimate excess mortality. But a small and innovative study released by the World Bank this week used an unusual method to estimate pandemic deaths in Kenya: a popular obituary website.

By looking back at several years on the website — which was used because better data did not exist — the researchers were able to see how past trends compared to the pandemic years. Their conclusion was that since the start of the pandemic, there have been roughly 28,000 “excess deaths” during the pandemic period, compared with just 5,520 recorded in official government figures.

Neither study provides anything like a full accounting of covid-19 in Africa. Instead, they add to a better understanding of the many gaps in knowledge about covid-19 that remain two years into the pandemic.

If we take the idea that both cases and deaths in Africa were significantly undercounted, it has some surprising knock-on impacts. In some cases, it may mean that demand for coronavirus vaccines across Africa could be lower. A number of groups, including the WHO’s Africa branch, have already suggested that the worst is over for the continent. Any plan for manufacturing on the continent will have to deal with this factor, as a recent analysis by the Center for Global Development argued.

More broadly, it refutes the idea that covid-19 was simply a disease for rich countries. As other studies have shown, there was a range of experiences among wealthy nations. And when excess deaths are evaluated on a global scale, the vast majority of them may have been in the developing world. Africa wasn’t miraculously spared from the pandemic, and there’s little reason to think it could not be hit far harder next time.

2022-02-14 19:55:47+00:00,13,"For two years, the world has endured a near-constant drumbeat of loss. Loss of friends and family, loss of physical togetherness, loss of what once was.

But even as the coronavirus pandemic sent the world into seclusion, people sought connection. For one couple, it came on a dating app. Two nurses found a shared bond while treating patients in a coronavirus hospital ward. A pair of college students discovered their love for each other while pursuing a pandemic hobby: baking.

Sometimes, love surfaced in unexpected ways. For a single man in Chicago, the challenges of training a puppy brought a surprising emotional catharsis. A woman in Northern Virginia found a deeper sense of self-worth after taking off her wedding ring — the pandemic putting into sharp relief that her marriage was over.

For those who lost partners, the memory of love lingers. A woman whose husband died of covid-19 early in the pandemic still visits their favorite restaurant, placing the same order with the same waitress.

This Valentine’s Day, we share their stories — each one a portrait of love in a time defined by loss.

Puppy love By Brittany Shammas On the first night of what he would later call “the week of insanity,” Nirav Amin woke up beside his new puppy’s crate. On the floor. Somewhere in the blur of Day One as a dog owner, Nirav had passed out, exhausted. From almost the moment he brought Myles home to his two-bedroom Chicago apartment in July 2020, the then-36-year-old had been stuck in a loop of taking the puppy out only to have to clean up an accident inside. If he so much as stepped from sight, loud cries followed. More than once that week, as he survived on Belvita biscuits and 30-second showers, unable to leave Myles’s side for more than a few moments, Nirav reread the rescue agency’s return policy. A perfectionist, he feared he was getting it all wrong. “I didn’t think I had a bad dog,” he recalled. “I thought I was a bad owner.” Nirav had longed for a dog since he was a boy watching them romp around his neighbors’ backyards. His parents, though, had said no. “We’re not a dog family,” they told him, and eventually he gave up. In adulthood, he dog-sat for a friend and started thinking seriously about getting one of his own — someday. He thought he should wait until life slowed down a bit, until he had a partner. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Then the pandemic struck. Nirav, who once traveled so much for his job expanding a laundry company that he reached Marriott’s second-highest rewards tier, found himself confined to his apartment, listening to the highway humming outside his window. “The loneliness set in pretty quickly,” he said. But he didn’t recognize it until that first covid summer, when he was in a Zoom meeting and a dog leaped into the lap of another person on the call. That was it: Nirav needed a dog ASAP. After a fruitless online search of Chicagoland shelters — everyone wanted a dog in those early pandemic days — he stumbled upon a listing for a 3-month-old white-and-brown mutt then named Ollie. He drove two hours to Wisconsin to see him days later and, he said, “as soon as he came out, I was like, ‘Yes.’ ” Had it all been a mistake? Nirav got his answer toward the end of his first week with Myles, during therapy. His therapist asked how it was going with the puppy. Nirav broke into “the best cry of my life.” It hit him that part of what made the week so hard was having to go through it alone. He came to a realization: “This wasn’t going to be perfect, and it didn’t have to be.” It was a lesson he could apply to other aspects of his life, too. He didn’t need to be so hard on himself; he didn’t need to wait for the perfect relationship. As Myles dozed in a bed behind his desk on a recent weekday, Nirav said he had “found my best friend.” The dog gave him a reason to get up every morning as the pandemic dragged on, made him more open to new relationships and even turned his parents into dog lovers. Sometimes, first-time dog owners call Nirav in a panic, looking for advice. Don’t worry, he tells them. It’s all going to be fine.

Pancakes for one By Timothy Bella There was no more sacred a date spot for Sandra McGowan-Watts and husband Steven Watts than their table every week at the Original Pancake House. Every Wednesday or Thursday in Chicago, Sandra, a family medicine doctor, and Steven, a city bus driver, would laugh over a Denver omelet and apple pancakes served by their favorite waitress. While Sandra admits it wasn’t love at first sight for her, Steven was her rock. After they married in October 2007 and had their daughter, Justice, he did whatever he could to keep her smiling. “He made sure everything was done, so I could be the doctor and get work done. He would move mountains for me,” she said. “If I came home from work, the house would be clean or dinner would be done, and that was his way of love — through action.” Valentine’s Day, birthdays and anniversaries were big for them. So when the coronavirus pandemic was about to shut down in-person dining in Illinois days before his birthday in March 2020, Steven lamented at a restaurant how it might be “the last meal we’re going to have” in public together. Still, he found a way to bring humor to an otherwise dark time. “We were talking at the table a couple weeks later, and he comes up to me and goes, ‘Ma’am, can I take your order?’ ” Sandra, 47, recalled. “He said, ‘Man, what I wouldn’t give to sit in a restaurant and have people ask me what I wanted to drink right about now.’ ” Then, in early April 2020, Steven said his body ached after changing the oil and spark plugs on his lawn mower. The next morning, he had a fever. Sandra guessed that her 51-year-old husband had covid-19 and that he had gotten it from his mother, who was infected and eventually intubated. The couple had spent time with her shortly before she came down with symptoms. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement His condition worsened and, days after he was hospitalized, doctors told Sandra that her husband had to be intubated. Steven was scared, and she couldn’t see him in person, because he wasn’t allowed any visitors. She told him over the phone that he was going to be okay and that she loved him. “He said, ‘I love you, too.’ And that was it,” she said. He died on May 8, 2020 — a week after his mother. Life is admittedly lonely now. Sandra sometimes catches herself picking up the phone to call Steven to talk about their 13-year-old daughter, before she’s reminded he has been gone almost two years. “Going to sleep and waking up are the hardest parts of the day for me,” she said. “I think about him more at those times.” Valentine’s Day is difficult, although joining a brunch on the holiday last year with people she met through a Facebook support group for widowed Black women made it a little easier. Sandra has no plans this year, making Valentine’s Day feel “just like any other day, I guess.” She still goes back to the Original Pancake House. The same waitress who used to serve Steven and Sandra omelets and apple pancakes takes her order. But it’s different now. “It’s okay to cry and okay to be angry,” she said. “And it’s okay if you don’t want to be bothered or just want to be left alone.”

‘Get me to Europe’ By Meryl Kornfield Barbara Panella was stuck at home in Italy in March 2020 during the start of the country’s lockdowns, listlessly swiping on Tinder, when a cheery-looking American named Paige Mitterhoff popped onto her screen. They were 8,000 miles apart — Paige in Maui, where she traveled after being laid off as a massage therapist in New Jersey as the pandemic closed businesses; Barbara in Rome, where she worked as a sales associate for a global clothing company. But for fun, Paige had briefly set her location to Italy, curious about who she might find half a world away. Barbara swiped right. For four months, the couple were inseparable — virtually. They went to sleep at odd hours just to be online at the same time. On FaceTime, the pair dreamed up plans to meet once travel restrictions eased. Paige sent sunset snapshots, while Barbara pointed out Italian destinations they could visit. Invariably, one or both dozed off during their hours-long conversations, phone in hand. In July, the two hatched a plan to meet at the Piazza Trilussa, a picturesque square featuring one of Rome’s iconic fountains in the Bohemian neighborhood of Trastevere. Paige’s original itinerary called for a short stay in Utah, where she planned to visit friends, before traveling on to Italy. But as she headed to the check-in counter clutching a carry-on bag filled with American West-themed gifts for Barbara, the airline staff delivered bad news: Due to covid-19 restrictions, she couldn’t fly to Rome. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement “Get me to the closest country,” she told an agent. “Get me to Europe.” Fast-forward past a transatlantic journey to London and a 14-day quarantine at a short-term apartment rental, Paige landed in Italy. She took an Uber from the airport to her Airbnb near the piazza where Barbara was waiting. Barbara immediately recognized her: “She looked American.” Paige’s first impression: “She’s shorter than I thought.” Quickly, surprise gave way to wonder: “I was like, ‘Are you real?’ ” Paige later recalled, remembering how she poked Barbara’s cheek for confirmation. “I actually couldn’t believe it,” Paige said. They strolled through narrow streets filled with pharmacies and tiny restaurants, getting a beer together and talking. Paige, at first, felt like she rambled too much, while Barbara struggled with her English. Barbara had relied on Google Translate during their online chats. But slowly their anxieties dissipated. Soon enough, they were reveling in simple joys like going to the movies, eating out and waking up in the same bed. “It was like we were 15 years old,” Barbara said, giggling with Paige. A year later, Barbara, 27, and Paige, 29, have lived out some of the dreams they envisioned while stuck on opposite sides of the world. They adopted a black Labrador and launched a shared TikTok account — @cannoliandjersey — where they post videos of their adventures in Italy. Life together in one place has brought challenges — oftentimes, amusing ones. Paige is still learning Italian, but that hasn’t stopped Barbara’s 92-year-old grandmother from speaking to her as though she is fluent. And the pair laughed as they recalled how Paige once drank a full pot of Italian espresso, not realizing it was meant to be shared. Even as life settles into a new normal, they haven’t forgotten how lucky it is to be close. “Certain things, when you have a long-distance relationship in a pandemic, just mean a lot,” Barbara said.

New lingerie By Marisa Iati Their issues came into focus slowly, and then, all at once. Where she was open about her feelings, he avoided difficult topics. He was orderly, while she was messy. The differences between Anne Bell and her husband seemed exciting at first. But three decades later, they were fault lines in a marriage that no longer worked. Their partnership hit a roadblock in March 2020 as a new virus forced families across the world into seclusion. Since starting graduate school in 2016, Anne had gained weight. Her husband no longer wanted a physical relationship with her. Anne had a hard time accepting her new size 18 body. She avoided mirrors, refused to buy new clothes and hid behind her children in photos. Cooped up in their Virginia home, tensions boiled over. What exactly was said depends on whom you ask. She remembers him saying, “You’re difficult to love because you’re fat.” He acknowledges saying she was “fat” and “difficult to love” but says the remarks were delivered in two separate statements. In any event, the words stung. Anne told him she was sorry he had to be married to “someone so fat,” hoping desperately that he would push back — but he didn’t. Around last Thanksgiving, Anne and her husband took off their wedding rings. Divorce lawyers were hired. Anne, 55, moved out of the Northern Virginia home they had shared for seven years. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement In the months leading up to their split, she started seeing a weight-loss specialist and took medications, but her efforts only made her weight plateau. Maybe, she realized, the true dilemma was her mind-set. While she was asking her husband to love her as she was, she wasn’t showing love to herself. So Anne started listening to CDs with personal affirmations. In a mantra about maintaining the keys to your happiness, she heard a reminder not to let anyone else’s perception determine your self-worth. She saved encouraging quotes to a Pinterest board called “Body Beautiful,” formed a body-positivity group at her job and attended a wellness retreat. And, after refusing for so long, Anne finally bought nice clothes that fit. The changes didn’t save her marriage, which by then was too strained to save after years of mounting grievances, but they set her on a path toward self-acceptance. In January, a marketing email from the plus-size clothing retailer Lane Bryant landed in her inbox. Valentine’s Day was just around the corner, it said. Did she need new lingerie? Anne thought about her divorce. Then she considered how long it had been since she had let herself wear a negligee, too put off by her larger body to want to highlight it. Now more comfortable in her skin, she clicked on the website and ordered a sheer, gray, baby-doll nightie with a lacy neckline and tiny ribbons. She wouldn’t be celebrating Valentine’s Day with her husband, but, she decided, she could still buy and enjoy something for herself. “This relationship didn’t work,” she said. “Marriage didn’t work. But something else will.”

Behind the mask By Meryl Kornfield As the hospital wing where Allison Torres worked became a coronavirus ward two years ago, she and other nurses suited up in protective gear — masks, gowns and gloves shielding all but the hint of a smile. Despite the coverings, Bryan Zayas de Jesus couldn’t help but exchange glances with Allison as his night shift at AdventHealth, a hospital in Kissimmee, Fla., ended and her workday began. He told a mutual friend he thought she was beautiful. Bryan, now 30, had moved to Florida to work at the hospital from his native Puerto Rico right before the pandemic, suddenly finding himself in a new place without close family tending to patients fighting for their lives against a strange new virus. When Allison joined the night shift the summer after the pandemic began, Bryan jumped at the opportunity to chat with her — and ask her on a date. They left behind their scrubs and went to somewhere seemingly safe: the beach. “Being in the same field, we understand each other on a deeper level than someone who is not going through that working through the pandemic,” said Allison, now 28. Their relationship blossomed — in a bubble. After work, they allowed each other 15 minutes to “word vomit” about their day and then agreed to drop any discussion of the virus. They rarely went out during the three surges in Florida, limiting themselves to classic pandemic activities like gardening and board games. Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement “We’ve worked it, we’ve lived it, and that’s what has made us more cautious,” Allison said. They did make one exception. Before Bryan proposed, he took Allison to Puerto Rico to meet his family. They flew to the island, where she met the relatives she had heard about from afar. Soon after, the couple got engaged and planned a wedding for April. The celebration that spring at a botanical garden near Orlando had the sort of precautions one might anticipate from two nurses: A hand sanitation station and colored wristbands to indicate social distancing preferences for the small number of friends and families who attended. Nine months later, the couple welcomed a son, Jonah. Reflecting on the past two years, Allison Torres Zayas notes that the entire course of their relationship has taken place during the pandemic — “a whirlwind.” They are looking forward to a time when their relationship exists outside the bookends of the coronavirus. Chief among their plans: visiting Puerto Rico again so Bryan’s family can meet his son. “We don’t know life outside of the pandemic — our marriage, our baby,” Allison said. In spite of the hardship, they feel grateful that the crisis brought them together. “That’s been the beauty of finding love through all of this,” she said.",washingtonpost,"['barbara', 'pandemic', 'lost', 'nirav', 'sandra', 'continues', 'paige', 'day', 'love', 'dog', 'advertisement']",0

There’s plenty of creepy, crawly stuff in the soil, and organisms such as worms, snails and slugs are essential to the planet’s health. But flatworms, a subset of creepy creatures that feed on those soil dwellers and gobble up biodiversity in the process, are a threat to the world’s dirt. Now, scientists have identified two new species of the alien-appearing animals — and named one after covid-19.

It’s called Humbertium covidum, and although the specimens studied were found in France and Italy, it may also be in China, Japan and Russia.

In an article in the journal PeerJ, the researchers say it’s unclear where they originated. That’s a big problem with flatworms, which are thought to make their way into the soil of different continents via the global plant trade.

The black, slick, hammer-headed, metallic-looking worm is relatively tiny (a little over an inch long), but it has the potential to become invasive. Flatworms’ feeding frenzy allows them to outcompete many other soil animals, making the dirt less fertile and stable. One 2012 study estimated that New Zealand flatworms Arthurdendyus triangulatus killed 20 percent of some earthworm populations in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Researchers say they named the newly identified hammerhead flatworm after covid-19 as a nod to the pandemic that enabled the research.

“Due to the pandemic, during the lockdowns most of us were home, with our laboratory closed,” said Jean-Lou Justine, a professor at the National Museum of National History in Paris, in a news release. “No field expeditions were possible. I convinced my colleagues to gather all the information we had about these flatworms, do the computer analyses, and finally write this very long paper.”

Justine said the name was also intended to pay tribute to the coronavirus’s victims.

The other species, Diversibipalium mayottensis, is a shimmering shade of blue-green. It’s not clear how it made its way to the island of Mayotte, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, but the researchers say it may have come from Madagascar.

President Biden on Friday urged all Americans to get vaccinated, as he marked another “tragic milestone” in the coronavirus pandemic. “900,000 American lives have been lost to COVID-19,” he said in a late-night statement issued Friday. “They were beloved mothers and fathers, grandparents, children, brothers and sisters, neighbors, and friends.”

The death toll would have been higher without coronavirus vaccines, Biden said, estimating they had “saved more than one million American lives,” as he urged unvaccinated Americans to “get vaccinated, get your kids vaccinated, and get your booster shot if you are eligible.”

Less than two months ago, the White House marked 800,000 covid-19 deaths in the United States. The current wave of cases, fueled by the more transmissible omicron variant, appears to be trending down, but some states are still seeing rising cases, as hospitals remain overwhelmed and public health experts warn the vaccination rate is too low.

The Washington Post tracker, which uses data from Johns Hopkins University and local and state government sites, shows at least 900,000 reported deaths since Feb. 29, 2020.

The United States is still lagging behind other wealthy countries on vaccination as political polarization, misinformation, confusing public health messaging and barriers to access continue to hobble its vaccination drive. Sixty-four percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, according to Washington Post data, and 42 percent of the fully vaccinated have received their booster dose.

“If everyone had gotten vaccinated and boosted as vaccines became available 300,000 Americans would likely still be with us,” Ashish K. Jha, Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, tweeted Saturday as he warned the death toll could hit 1 million by April. “The loss is staggering. And so much of it, preventable.”

Recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that between October and November 2021, in 25 jurisdictions in the United States, unvaccinated people were more than 53 times as likely to die of covid-19 than people who were vaccinated and boosted.

There was an average of 326,666 reported covid-19 cases in the United States over the past week — far fewer than the seven-day average of 553,000 recorded a month ago. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are still high but trending downward after peaking around mid-January.

This has led some public health experts to express cautious optimism that the pandemic could be managed in the coming months.

In late January, Anthony S. Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said on ABC’s “The Week” that he hoped that the country would soon be entering what he called a best-case scenario, provided adequate vaccinations, testing, masks and treatments were in place.

“We would hope that, as we get into the next weeks to month or so, we will see throughout the entire country the level of infection get … down to such a low level that it’s essentially integrated into the general respiratory infections that we have learned to live with.”

In his statement, Biden acknowledged how difficult the pandemic has been for many Americans, especially those who have lost loved ones to covid-19. “I know that the emotional, physical, and psychological weight of this pandemic has been incredibly difficult to bear,” he wrote.

“Two hundred and fifty million Americans have stepped up to protect themselves, their families, and their communities by getting at least one shot,” he added. “We can save even more lives — and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable — if everybody does their part.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to expand a system that detects the coronavirus in wastewater to better predict surges and declines of the virus and, eventually, wants to harness the network’s early-warning power to find other deadly pathogens and control outbreaks of food-borne disease. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Research suggests that 40 to 80 percent of people infected with the coronavirus shed viral genetic material in their feces even if they don’t have symptoms. It’s one of the first signs of an infection.

Increases in wastewater virus levels generally take place four to six days before health officials see a corresponding rise in case counts or hospitalizations.

“These data are uniquely powerful because they capture the presence of infections from people with and without symptoms and are not affected by access to health care or availability of clinical testing,” Amy Kirby, who leads the agency’s wastewater surveillance system, said during a briefing Friday.

Wastewater surveillance can be used to track other diseases and health concerns, Kirby said. Officials are working to expand surveillance to gather data on other pathogens by the end of the year, with targets including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, norovirus, influenza, a deadly fungal pathogen called Candida auris and food-borne infections caused by E. coli and salmonella.

In response to the pandemic, the agency launched a national wastewater surveillance system in September 2020. Sewage surveillance has been used for years around the world to identify polio outbreaks. Several other countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, have been monitoring sewage systems for the coronavirus.

The CDC gets data from about 400 testing sites that measure the coronavirus in wastewater. Some health departments are also able to conduct advanced genetic sequencing to track variants of concern. California, Colorado, New York City and Houston were the first to detect evidence of the omicron variant in community wastewater.

Participating states have used wastewater data to make public health decisions, Kirby said, such as directing mobile testing to certain vaccination sites and readying additional equipment and other resources for hospitals in communities where cases are forecast to increase.

Universities, colleges, states and cities, and commercial testing companies collect samples from sewage pipes to monitor the spread of the virus. Cities including Boston were able to identify impending case surge and conclude that the omicron variant had peaked.

The CDC until 2020 did not have a national system to track infectious diseases through wastewater. The agency has since provided money to 37 states, four cities and two territories for utilities to collect sewage samples, for laboratories to get those samples tested and for state officials to send the data to the CDC. Many of these states are still implementing their systems.

On Friday, the CDC said it was making public on its website the data it has received from 28 states and the District of Columbia. Some states have that data available on their websites, but the CDC data allows consumers to compare data across states.

More than 34,000 samples have been collected from communities representing about 53 million people. The CDC plans to add 255 testing sites in the next few weeks and additional sites during the next few months, expanding the reach of the program “to look into most states” and territories and tribal communities, Kirby said.

Kirby said her team is working with the rest of the agency’s coronavirus response to “find ways that wastewater surveillance can help provide situational awareness for what’s going on in the community, as well as serving as that early warning system that a new increase may be coming in a community.”

In Ohio, a color-coded map on the state health department’s website shows the increase or decrease in virus levels in wastewater for an area. Substantial increases in virus levels trigger an email notification to health districts, utilities and community health leaders, according to a CDC report last fall.

In Utah, wastewater data is one of the main components of a ranking system to determine where to dispatch mobile testing teams.

Out of 255 surveillance systems with data, 70 percent showed a decline in the virus over the past 15 days, while the remainder reported increases. No clear patterns emerged from the data, and in many cases treatment plants showing increases are next to plants with decreases.

When I got the coronavirus in January, I spent the better part of two weeks in bed, too tired to do much. As I recovered slowly, a thought kept churning in my head as I considered my future immunity: “What does this mean for travel?” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people not to “travel until a full 10 days after your symptoms started or the date your positive test was taken if you had no symptoms.” In the 90 days after you’ve fully recovered and meet criteria to end isolation, the CDC says, you can travel safely. If you’re not fully vaccinated, delay travel until you are, or incorporate testing into your trip plans if you must travel.

But health experts said life after infection comes with caveats, especially as we learn more about omicron. Here’s what four experts advise.

‘There’s a wide range of behaviors that are acceptable’

Céline Gounder, an infectious-disease expert at New York University and a member of President Biden’s covid-19 transition task force, says based on the rate she has seen antibodies decline after infection, “you probably do have at least a couple of months of some kind of protection against both infection and disease.”

Advertisement

The protection doesn’t work like a switch, and it depends on whether a person has had the coronavirus before and whether they are vaccinated.

“It’s sort of this steady decline,” Gounder says. “Somewhere between three and six months, you certainly would be at risk for reinfection.”

How you approach travel after a coronavirus infection will depend on your demographic and risk factors. While travel will never be 100 percent safe, “I think as long as you’re not putting others in danger, and you’re not being reckless to the point of really adding to the burden on health-care systems … there’s a wide range of behaviors that are acceptable,” Gounder says.

She finds trips where you can spend most time outdoors to be the least risky, including going camping and visiting destinations where you can eat outside at restaurants. If you are flying anywhere, Gounder recommends wearing an N95 mask, like the 3M Aura one (“They’re actually pretty comfortable,” she says) and keeping it on as much as possible from the time you leave your house to the time you arrive at your final destination.

‘We’re never going to go back to the way it was’

People should remain vigilant about coronavirus mitigation efforts, even if they’ve recently had it, says Brian C. Castrucci, the president and chief executive of de Beaumont Foundation, a public health charity.

For vaccinated and boosted travelers who have had omicron, “you probably do have immunity, but we don’t know for how long,” Castrucci says. “The immunity is not going to be enduring, and it’s still possible to get a severe infection that has ongoing symptoms.”

Just as there are still safety protocols in place at airports following the 9/11 attacks, we can expect coronavirus protocols to stay put, Castrucci says.

“We’re never going to go back to the way it was,” he says. “Even if this becomes endemic, it’s going to then indelibly change how we go about our lives.”

Castrucci says what that looks like for travelers going forward is wearing a well-fitting mask in public places, knowing the vaccination and case rate of the place you’re visiting, taking a coronavirus test before you leave, and packing rapid tests in case you feel sick on the road.

‘Natural infection wanes a lot faster than vaccination’

If you’re vaccinated, boosted and recently recovered from the coronavirus, “your chances of having a serious reinfection are not very high,” says Karl E. Minges, the interim dean of the University of New Haven’s School of Health Sciences in Connecticut.

Advertisement

However, “you’re not protected forever,” Minges says. “Natural infection wanes a lot faster than vaccination. So if you have been infected by omicron and you’re unvaccinated, do get vaccinated.”

Recovering from infection “doesn’t change the calculus about what activities are safer as compared to others,” Minges says, encouraging recovered people to follow the same precautions they would before. For example, take a rapid test before doing something on the upper level of your risk tolerance, like traveling.

‘We saw many people infected with delta who got reinfected with omicron’

Jayne Morgan, a cardiologist and executive director of the covid-19 task force at Piedmont Healthcare, does not want recently recovered travelers to have a false sense of security, because the future of mutating variants is impossible to predict.

“You should still exercise caution because you still have the ability to be reinfected with new variants that could come about,” Morgan says. “We saw many people infected with delta who got reinfected with omicron.”

While Morgan says 90 days is usually how long immunity lasts before it starts to drop, there is inconsistency with how it drops. With much unknown about the omicron variant, it is unclear how long natural immunity lasts and whether it will be effective in protecting against future variants.

Beyond keeping up with covid-cautious behavior as a social responsibility to vulnerable people around you, Morgan says not to let up your defense because of the state of the pandemic.

“We are still in the middle of a pandemic with exceptionally high numbers,” she says. “We are in a worse situation with [case] numbers now than we were with our first three surges.”

That doesn’t mean you can’t take a vacation. Morgan says she advocates for trips with outdoor activities, which she recognizes may be difficult, but not impossible, to pull off in cold winter weather.

“This is a great time to take a ski trip and be outdoors,” she says.

Guys, look. It’s been a rough few years, and I understand that. But I think you’ll agree when I say it’s simply time to move on. To start living our lives without fear. To stop trying to force folks to do things they don’t want to do simply to limit the small chance that people might die as a result.

So, I’ll say it: I’m ready to move on from worrying about murder.

There was an interesting tweet over the weekend that drew an analogy I hadn’t considered.

“More Americans have died of COVID in the past 11 days than have died of murder in any year ever,” attorney David Menschel wrote.

At first I misread it and thought he was saying that there had been more deaths from covid-19 than people murdered in the United States in its history, which is obviously wrong. But he was looking at just one year. And, yes: the country saw more new covid deaths from Jan. 18 to 30 than the number of murders in 1991, 24,700. (If you’re about to start typing “dying with!!!!!!” in an email or a tweet, please read this.) Those days were deadlier for Americans than the deadliest year for homicides in our country’s history.

We can take this further. The current covid-19 death toll — a toll that began less than two years ago — is about the same as the number of people who have been murdered since 1975. We’ve seen as many covid deaths since Jan. 21 as we did murders in 2020 — a year in which murder spiked. We’ve seen as many deaths from covid-19 since early October of last year as the number of recorded murders since the beginning of 2010.

Overlaying the daily death toll with the country’s historic murder toll shows how the two figures compare. About a year ago, we were losing more people to covid in eight days than were murdered in 1991.

There are obvious differences between murder and covid-19, of course. One is that covid-19 deaths are almost entirely preventable. While there have been concerted efforts to tamp down on homicides and on deaths from the coronavirus, only the latter can be largely eliminated by a simple vaccine.

Here, too, there’s lots of misinformation. So we’ll appeal to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In December, Americans 50 and up were 18 times more likely to wind up in the hospital with covid-19 if they weren’t fully vaccinated. That gap nearly tripled when comparing the unvaccinated with those who had received a booster dose. Those who had been fully vaccinated were 15 times less likely to die; those who’d gotten a booster were 68 times less likely to die.

A lot of Americans, however, choose not to get vaccinated. Some quit their jobs rather than take that step, even when it protects them and slows the spread of the virus to others. That, too, is a concern expressed by experts: Letting the virus spread unchecked means that those who choose not to be vaccinated and those who cannot for medical reasons are at increased risk of infection. It means more strain on hospitals and hospital workers.

So now the debate changes. The advent of the highly contagious omicron variant — which is better able to evade vaccines, though it doesn’t appear to increase deaths among the vaccinated — overlaps with the sheer exhaustion of spending two years worrying about this. In response, there’s been a renewed sense of exasperation at the whole thing. Or, as Monmouth University found when it polled on the pandemic, 7 in 10 Americans now think that we just accept that covid is here to stay and we get on with our lives.

There’s a partisan gulf on that, as you would probably assume, but even among Democrats, views are about split. Even half of Democrats appear to think it’s time to simply get back to normal.

Nine in 10 Republicans feel the same way. Most of them have been vaccinated, it’s important to note, although most of the unvaccinated are Republicans or Republican-leaning independents. Vaccination rates among White Republicans are far lower than among White Democrats and lower than among Black and Hispanic Americans. It’s a gap that’s likely to widen, given hostility on the right toward booster shots.

In other words, it’s the group most at risk that is most willing to see risk increase. Fair enough, but this is a very American and very familiar gamble. Live your life as you wish, betting that you won’t end up on the wrong side of the coin toss. It has paid off for millions of Americans! It has not paid off for more than 160,000 others.

But, again, I demand we go further. No more efforts to catch murderers. No more letting people carry firearms in self-defense. No more restraining orders. No more letting “experts” on law enforcement tell us what to do. I mean, how many times have the experts on murder made claims that turned out to be wrong? Let’s just ignore them entirely. Maybe we even just go full “The Purge” and encourage everyone to get their murdering done right off the bat, so we can put it all behind us.

I’m just … I’m just ready to move on.

Correction: An earlier version of this article referred to a drop of more than $2 billion in Spotify’s “market share.” The Variety article cited referred to a drop in market capitalization of that amount. This story has been corrected. Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, podcaster Brené Brown and more are standing up to Spotify for allowing Joe Rogan to keep airing coronavirus misinformation. (Video: Allie Caren/The Washington Post) Spotify broke its silence on Sunday and announced slight changes to its policies around content concerning covid-19, after facing a week of criticism for allowing its creators — particularly podcaster Joe Rogan — to spread misinformation about the pandemic. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “You’ve had a lot of questions over the last few days about our platform policies and the lines we have drawn between what is acceptable and what is not,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote in a news release. “We have had rules in place for many years but admittedly, we haven’t been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly.”

The new changes include publicly publishing the company’s internal rules for what is allowed on the platform, “testing ways to highlight” those rules to its creators and “working to add a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about COVID-19.”

“We know we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users,” Ek wrote. “In that role, it is important to me that we don’t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.”

The controversy began last week, when rocker Neil Young posted a letter on his website demanding that his music be removed from Spotify in response to “fake information about vaccines” on the platform. He singled out Rogan, who hosts “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, as part of his issue with Spotify, writing: “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.”

Two days later, Spotify began the process of pulling Young’s music, saying in a statement that they “regret” Young’s decision “but hope to welcome him back soon.”

Days later, others began joining Young. “I’ve decided to remove all my music from Spotify,” eight-time Grammy-winning songwriter Joni Mitchell wrote in a statement on her website on Friday. “Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.”

Nils Lofgren, the frontman of rock band Grin and a member of both Crazy Horse and Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, wrote in a statement on Young’s website that he would “cut ties with Spotify” and urged “all musicians, artists and music lovers everywhere” to do the same. Brené Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston who hosts the “Unlocking Us” and “Dare to Lead” podcasts on Spotify, tweeted Saturday that she “will not be releasing any podcasts until further notice,” though she did not say why. Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who have a deal to host and produce Spotify podcasts, expressed “concerns” in a statement released Sunday.

Folk rocker David Crosby, a former bandmate of Young’s, tweeted that he would remove his music from the service, but “I no longer control it or I would in support of Neil.” That’s true for many rock stars lately, who could deal a blow to the streaming service if they hadn’t sold their entire catalogues already for large sums.

Others, including Howard Stern and “The View” host Joy Behar, have argued that while they don’t agree with Rogan, they don’t think the platform should remove his podcast, equating such a move to censorship.

The resulting fallout, according to Variety, found Spotify’s market capitalization falling more than $2 billion last week.

Spotify’s newly published platform rules shed light on why Rogan — who has suggested healthy, young people shouldn’t get vaccinated; praised ivermectin, a medicine used to kill parasites in animals and humans that has no proven anti-covid benefits; and invited prominent conspiracy theorists onto his show — has not been heavily penalized.

The rules include disallowing “content that promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health,” such as asserting that covid-19 is a hoax or “promoting or suggesting that vaccines approved by local health authorities are designed to cause death.”

Rogan doesn’t quite do any of that. He often argues that he’s merely asking questions and has insisted that he’s “not anti-vax.” And he’s particularly skilled at insulating himself from criticism by arguing that he knows nothing, so he can’t tell anyone anything. “I’m not a respected source of information, even for me,” he said.

Covid-19 transmission may have seasonal spikes tied to temperature and humidity, increasing at different times of the year for different locations, a new study in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene suggests. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Colder regions, such as the U.S. Northeast, may experience more cases during winter, while warmer regions, such as the southern United States, may see higher transmissions in the summer. More-temperate zones could experience two seasonal peaks.

“We think covid may be becoming endemic, meaning that it will stay within the human population, but we will see spikes based on where we are in a particular geographic point,” said author Antar Jutla, a hydrologist at the University of Florida. “The severity of peaks will be defined by how colder the temperature is and how warmer the temperature is.”

Jutla and his colleagues found that coronavirus cases in 19 hot spots worldwide increased above and below certain temperature and humidity thresholds because of human behavior and the virus’s movement as an aerosol. Case numbers spiked when air temperatures dipped below 62 degrees (17 Celsius) or above 75 degrees (24 Celsius). The virus also tends to linger more in drier environments compared to humid ones.

“We need to basically design the intervention or mitigation strategies based on the environment in which we live,” Jutla said. “Regions like Florida, India, Africa — they are warm regions. … They basically get hit by these waves, but at different times than what happens in the northern parts, the colder regions.”

Although case numbers could surge during extreme chills or heat waves, such temperatures typically need to persist for about a 14-day average, Jutla said. The team validated the data to December 2021, but characteristics could change with new mutations or new variants of the novel coronavirus.

Aerosol researcher and co-author Chang-Yu Wu explained that local humidity and temperature play vital roles in the size of the virus’s particles, which can influence its life span in the air. Drier atmospheres in colder regions will induce water evaporation from the particles, shrinking their size and allowing them to float in the air for longer periods. People also tend to seek shelter inside in colder environments and expose themselves to recirculated air that potentially contains the virus.

The air in humid, hotter environments contains more water, which can condense onto the virus particles, make them bigger and theoretically fall to the ground faster. At the same time, people often move inside to avoid the outdoor warmth and again expose themselves to recirculated air. Air conditioners also dry the inside air, creating an environment similar to that of winter for aerosols.

“Human behavior is a very important factor in the transmission,” said Wu, who also is a professor at the University of Florida. “It’s not just purely the physics or biology [of the virus] that dictates. … It’s a combination of these.”

Fewer cases were detected between 62 and 75 degrees, a temperature range considered more tolerable for people to be outside.

“This study confirms the previous findings of seasonality with SARS-CoV-2 infection (low temperature and humidity),” Mohammad Sajadi, a professor at the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, wrote in an email. “It also adds to our knowledge about transmission in warmer temperatures.” Sajadi was not involved in the study.

He said more work is needed to further explore the use of air conditioning, stating that “the United States and India likely have different levels of usage, which was not accounted for in this study.”

“If anything, [the study] again shows us how complicated the issue of seasonality is,” Sajadi wrote.

Sajadi compared the findings to the seasonality, or climatic conditions, of influenza as well. For influenza infections, he said the stability of aerosols also occurs at two vastly different levels of humidity. The different patterns of seasonality depend on the geographic locale, too.

Others found the climate-covid relationships in different locations plausible as well.

“I like that the study points out that climate-covid relationships will differ by region,” said Ben Zaitchik, a co-chair of a covid-19 research task team at World Meteorological Organization. Zaitchik, who commented by email, was not involved in the study. “We found something similar in a study … and I think it’s important to emphasize,” he wrote.

He also stressed that linking climate to covid risk is an evolving field of research. Several studies with other climate-covid mechanisms have been published in the past few months, including one discussing the challenges of studying such an area.

It is important to remember that these are only one driver of risk, Zaitchik wrote. “All evidence is that it has been a secondary driver up to this point in the pandemic. It might become more important as covid becomes endemic and settles into a seasonally locked pattern — which many expect that it will.”

Considering the virus’s environmental and socioeconomic influences, Jutla and colleagues also created a model to predict the risk of covid weekly in the United States.

The model, which is in the beta phase, includes air temperature, humidity, population density, economic stability (income), age, diversity, housing, vaccination data sets and other factors. The predictive model builds on work by Jutla and other co-authors, who previously demonstrated how cholera outbreaks are tied to environmental factors such as air temperature and salinity.

“Social behavioral sciences need to be strongly intertwined with the natural sciences,” said co-author Rita Colwell, a biologist at the University of Maryland who helped uncover the role the environment plays in cholera transmission. “The intersection of the physical environment and human behavior in warm and cold regions is exemplified in the covid case reports.”

The model shows about 80 to 90 percent accuracy nationwide (validated on a county-level scale), although Zaitchik said it is important to see the model in a peer-reviewed form, especially because of its novelty. “There hasn’t been any robust demonstration of a model like that for covid-19 risk prediction,” he said.

Overall, the researchers stressed that proper ventilation and filtration, such as masks, are among the most important measures for preventing transmission of the disease. Air sampling studies have repeatedly shown that excellent ventilation and filtration can reduce covid case loads, even in larger, relatively crowded places such as gyms.

“For me, the biggest takeaway is the need to focus on the built environment,” Zaitchik wrote. “It’s not simply a matter of ‘is it cold out’; it’s a matter of whether those cold temperatures are leading you to crowd indoors, reduce ventilation, use climate controls that result in low indoor humidity, etc.”

correction A previous version of this story stated “Wu compares the particles to a rock in this case — the more mass, the faster it falls."" This sentence has been removed to avoid confusion for the reader as this comparison does not comprehensively describe the physics of the aerosol behavior.

correction The conservative media figure’s name is Dan Bongino. An earlier version of this article misspelled his first name. This article has been updated. Google-owned YouTube said it had permanently banned prominent conservative media figure Dan Bongino from its site after he repeatedly broke its rules on posting coronavirus misinformation. Bongino, who hosts a show on Fox News in addition to talk radio shows and online broadcasts, had been given a strike and a week-long suspension from YouTube earlier in January for saying in one of his videos that masks were useless. He uploaded another video later in the month that also broke the platform’s rules on coronavirus misinformation. When he tried to upload a third video, the company banned him permanently.

YouTube has had rules against posting false or misleading information about the coronavirus and vaccines since the beginning of the pandemic, although critics have said the company enforces its rules unevenly. In September, it took down the accounts of several anti-vaccine influencers after years of research by misinformation researchers suggested the platform played a role in the growth of vaccine hesitancy.

Bongino did not respond to a request for comment, but a Twitter account associated with one of his shows posted a tweet saying, “Good riddance to YouTube.” Bongino had around 870,000 subscribers on YouTube but has over 2 million on Rumble, a video platform popular with right-wing figures who say Big Tech is censoring them. He had threatened to leave YouTube before the ban.

Bongino is one of a small handful of conservative figures who have been handed permanent suspensions from the big social media companies. President Donald Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter also permanently banned Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) this month after she also repeatedly posted false information about the coronavirus, though she is still able to use her official congressional Twitter account. For the most part, the social media companies have instead opted for short-term suspensions. Trump is also banned from Facebook and YouTube, but the companies have both left the door open to letting him return.

Bongino and other conservative media figures have used the bans and suspensions to promote alternative social media networks that purport to have fewer rules about what can and can’t be said, such as Gettr, Gab, Telegram and Rumble. A Washington Post analysis of audience data for 47 right-wing influencers showed that when they moved to one of the alternative networks, their follower counts jumped but then quickly stagnated and stopped growing at the same speed as they had on the more mainstream networks.

What I thought was a dry throat caused by staying in my grandparents’ 85-degree home over the holidays was covid-19. I tested positive in late December, after I got home, as the number of covid cases was rising toward record levels. My mother, teen sisters and grandparents tested positive around the same time, although all of us were vaccinated.

In addition to experiencing intense fatigue, body aches and congestion, I was very anxious about the rest of the family, although I tried to monitor them from afar. Other relatives commiserated with me and supplied me with information about serious symptoms I should be on the lookout for. (As it turned out, we all had mild cases.)

What I needed most while I was ill was emotional support, but every person who has the coronavirus is different. And it’s likely you know such a person, because the omicron variant continues to rage: Between Dec. 29. and Jan. 10, approximately 8.8 million workers reported being unable to go to their jobs because they either had covid or were taking care of someone who did.

If you’re wondering what you can do to help someone who is home with covid-19, here are some suggestions, based on my experience, and interviews with experts and other people who have had the virus.

Supply groceries and more. Groceries are a top priority, especially for those who do not live in areas with access to grocery-delivery services. Delivering take-out meals, whether personally or via a service such as Uber Eats, is also appreciated.

But another extremely helpful errand is a pharmacy run. Patients may need to have a prescription refilled, may be running low on or menstrual supplies, or might just appreciate a heating pad and some over-the-counter remedies.

Think about other items that can help patients feel better, such as homemade soup or soothing facial tissues. “I found a supply of clean pillows to be huge for me,” said Eli Sashihara, 29. He used them to prop himself up when he had particularly nasty congestion while isolating with his 27-year-old brother and roommate, Gabe, in New Hope, Penn. The triple-vaccinated siblings were hit hard by the virus — “I got basically every symptom that you hear about,” Eli said — and relied on support from their parents and older brother.

Help with chores. In addition to delivering groceries and supplies, you might offer to take on some chores. Consider volunteering to do a load of laundry; clean sheets and PJs can help a patient feel better. If someone with covid lives in a colder climate, you can shovel out their driveway or sidewalk or hire someone else to complete the task; in warmer areas, you can water outdoor plants. You could also collect mail and newspapers, or put out trash and recycling.

Care for non-infected members of the household. New Jersey residents Steve Sussman and Andrea Beloff Sussman, who are in their 50s, contracted covid-19 in December of 2020, but the young adults in the house were spared. “The thing that we appreciated the most was [our relatives’ and friends’] thoughtfulness when it came to our kids. Making sure that they had food, that they had things they needed,” Sussman said.

Child care and pet care are concerns for a lot of coronavirus-positive families. Nathan Sashihara, Gabe and Eli’s older brother, took care of their kittens, because they were worried the cats would contract the virus. If you are not up for an extended playdate or boarding situation, consider offering to walk a dog or talking a healthy child to a park to run off some energy.

Let them know you’re thinking of them. Three generations in the Subhani household in Union, N.J., got covid before they could be vaccinated last spring, leaving them feeling isolated. Mercedes Subhani, 22, who, along with her mother was caring for her grandparents while ill herself, said she appreciated it when her aunt sat in their back yard and talked to them on the phone. It felt as if her aunt was there in person — without being put at risk.

The family was also touched when relatives delivering groceries included something special. “We all love Ferrero Rocher, and my aunt and uncle knew that so they would get the essential groceries and just have that box on top,” Subhani said. “And those little things obviously make the difference.”

Sending TikToks, sharing memes, emailing and text messaging are short, sweet ways to let someone know they are in your thoughts. But don’t forget that tech-based communication doesn’t work for everyone, as James Lubben, professor emeritus at Boston College’s School of Social Work, points out. “Technology has helped enriched social ties among those who are capable of navigating that technology,” he said, but it’s tough for people who don’t have the resources or the training. In that case, he recommends going back to the basics, whether it’s phone calls or even letters. Cards can be appreciated by all ages.

Check in daily. Eric Goldberg, a family doctor at NYU Langone Health, said that every household should have a thermometer to track fever and a finger-based pulse oximeter to measure a person’s blood oxygen. If you know a covid patient who doesn’t have these items, it’s a good idea to supply them.

Then set up daily check-ins to determine whether intervention is needed. You want to find out how the patient is breathing; if their oxygenation levels continue to fall, or drop after small exertions; if their temperature is continuing to rise; or if they have a fever over 103 degrees for multiple days in a row.

“If they can’t finish a sentence without gasping for air or struggling for air, then that’s a sign that they’re not recovering according to plan,” Goldberg said.

When I was sick, I called my grandfather daily. His lifelong bronchial asthma and memory loss made it difficult to track his symptoms, so I would chit-chat with him and listen for coughing.

Keep spirits up. “One important thing family members can do is to assure their loved ones that feeling depressed or anxious during a time like this is totally normal and even expected,” said Brooke Smith, assistant professor of psychology at Western Michigan University. When people attempt to hide from these uncomfortable feelings, it “actually ends up increasing the feelings of depression and anxiety, and it makes it difficult to engage in meaningful activity,” she said.

She suggested talking about what is meaningful for your friends and relatives and brainstorming how, even in non-ideal circumstances, they can continue to pursue their values. “Let’s say someone values being a loving grandparent, but they can’t see their grandkids right now,” Smith said. “But maybe they could write letters, or maybe they could make a craft. There are a lot of ways that people can get creative to pursue their values.”

Fight boredom. When Eli Sashihara’s fever was raging, it was hard for him to look at a screen. If bingeing Netflix isn’t working for someone you know, drop off other activities. Puzzles, crafts, knitting supplies and books are good places to start.

Help clean. Weeks’ worth of dishes, laundry and general clutter pile up quickly. A common concern of those interviewed was the state of their homes after their illnesses; many had lingering symptoms that made it difficult to get back to household chores. “A big thing is just to help around the house,” Subhani said. “I know a lot of people want to do extravagant things, but sometimes the essential needs go an extremely long way.”

Be persistent. Finally, Sussman suggests asking your friends or loved ones to tell you one specific thing that you can do for them during this tough time. “A lot of people don’t want to burden their family or friends, and they say, ‘No, I’m okay, I got it, don’t worry,’ ” he said. “But push them a little.”

For the past two Christmases, Ana Siqueira has received the same unwanted gift: covid-19. And so has her husband. The one-two punch they experienced underscores the coronavirus’s staying power and ability to crack through the body’s defenses. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The first time Siqueira got the virus, one of her sons was isolating with covid at home, and Siqueira hadn’t been vaccinated.

But the second time, Siqueira, 57, a children’s book author and Spanish teacher from Palm Harbor, Fla., had checked all the boxes. She wore a mask in public, practiced social distancing and was vaccinated and boosted, but thinks she caught covid anyway during a family trip to see her daughter in Seattle. Most of the family got swept up with infections, she said.

Although statistically rare, virus reinfections have been rising recently, leading some states to track them separately. Infectious-disease experts say getting covid more than once will lose its novelty for Americans. Time and the virus are both working against people’s defenses, they said.

Immunity developed from a previous infection fades over time. As the coronavirus pandemic enters its third year, many people who once had natural immunity have lost it. Protection provided by vaccines also wanes, and even before that happens, infections are possible among vaccinated and boosted individuals.

The coronavirus, meanwhile, is mutating to more infectious forms such as the delta variant and, more recently, the highly transmissible omicron variant.

For Siqueira, her first bout included nausea, a low fever for a week and anxiety. “I also felt weak and fainted twice. … I felt very sleepy and tired for almost a month,” she said.

The second time: nausea and nasal congestion. “I didn’t even think I had covid,” Siqueira said. “My nausea lingered for about two weeks.”

Coronavirus cases spiked globally in the first weeks of 2022, despite record-high vaccination rates. Here’s how the omicron variant took off. (Video: Jackie Lay, John Farrell/The Washington Post)

An unvaccinated man in Texas with underlying health conditions previously diagnosed with covid-19 was the first omicron-related death identified in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an August study found that “being unvaccinated was associated with 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared with being fully vaccinated,” using data from Kentucky for May and June 2021 — and that was before the delta or omicron variants had taken hold.

In a separate study from December, the CDC investigated 43 of the earliest omicron variant cases in the United States and found that six, or 14 percent, involved reinfections. The CDC defines a reinfection as when someone tests positive for the coronavirus again more than three months after a previous positive test. States including Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Washington have begun to publish reinfection statistics after seeing large spikes in their populations last year.

Among the factors that can predict whether someone might be reinfected: the time since being vaccinated and changes to the virus.

“You put the two together, and you have more and more reinfections,” said Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic.

“As it stands right now, people who have had the infection or people who have received the vaccination do show substantial protection against hospitalization or repeat infection,” Esper said. “However, it doesn’t last forever. It goes down over time, and it goes down quicker if a new variant or new strain shows up which is completely different from the other strains, which is what omicron is.”

Oklahoma reported 148 reinfections in January 2021, a monthly total that grew to 1,213 in September. Washington state officials reported 4,404 reinfection cases from September to Dec. 26, of which 60 percent involved unvaccinated patients. Louisiana reports more than 47,000 reinfections out of more than 1 million cases since the start of the pandemic.

Health officials say these numbers probably underrepresent the true total for reinfections, because people with the coronavirus may be asymptomatic or may not be tested.

“COVID-19 reinfections do occur but are rarely identified. People with a reported reinfection make up 1.7% of all reported cases of COVID-19,” the Washington state health department says. “This is likely lower than the actual number of reinfections, but we do not have sufficient information to estimate the actual amount at this time.”

At a White House briefing Friday, Anthony S. Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden on the coronavirus, said most reinfections involve a different variant and that it is “extremely unlikely” to get the same strain more than once.

“There are reinfections, but it is unlikely that, if you mount a good immune response, at least over a period of several months, it is extremely unlikely that you will be reinfected with the same variant,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We’ve seen infections, but those are mostly in people who have been infected with alpha who then wind up getting infected with beta or reinfected with omicron.”

William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said reinfections are bound to occur because “this is not a virus that produces a durable, lifetime protection like measles does.” The coronavirus and its variants could be sticking around indefinitely, managed like the flu with a regularly updated vaccine, he said.

“There are a lot of people who would literally like to put covid behind them, to forget about it, and it will be difficult to get them to understand that they and their children will be coping with covid like we cope with influenza on an annual basis,” Schaffner said.

For Kevin Metz, his first infection was heralded in October 2020 by a burning sensation on his skin, followed later by a nagging cough, trouble breathing and sleeping, and other symptoms, requiring a cortisone inhaler. The second bout in recent weeks felt more like a “bad head cold,” he said.

Metz, 54, a party rental company owner from Yardley, Pa., and his wife have both been diagnosed with covid twice. His wife thinks she caught it the first time after visiting a niece and passed it on to Metz, and Metz thinks he caught the virus the second time from a friend at a basketball game over Christmas and passed it to his wife, he said. He and his wife are vaccinated but not boosted, Metz said.

During the most recent illness, Metz said, symptoms were “not feeling as severe,” though it was still four or five days of nausea, coughing, sore throat and a runny nose. After recovering, Metz felt newly protected from the virus and in the mood for an island vacation, “but we didn’t wind up going anywhere.”

“Once we got it, I’m like: ‘We’re free now, we can go anywhere,’ ” he recalled.

“She was a little more concerned about it,” Metz said of his wife.

Ryan Hodgson caught covid for the second time over the Christmas holiday. Hodgson was at a restaurant that checked vaccination records and wore a mask at his table when he wasn’t eating or drinking; a friend who was there didn’t get sick.

“It blows my mind that with the cautions I was taking — I do everything by the book, everything — I still got covid,” said Hodgson, 47, who runs a leadership development business in Seattle.

After his first covid illness in April 2020, marked by deep chest pain and other symptoms, Hodgson resumed hiking, weightlifting, hot yoga and running.

“The first run I tried to do was like torture, because it lingered, that chest pain,” Hodgson recalled. “The second time, I’d had both covid vaccines and the booster and … it was similar body aches, similar fever, more headaches, a little cough that I had for a little while, but it didn’t go into my chest.”

“I have a lot of people saying it’s milder now,” Hodgson said. “It’s not mild.”

When health-care professionals use the term “mild,” they mean a patient did not have to be hospitalized and can recover at a home. But even patients with a mild case can suffer symptoms that lay them low for a few days.

Not even actor Josh Canfield, who lasted 21 days on “Survivor: San Juan del Sur,” could escape the covid double-whammy.

The first time it hit, in March 2020, Canfield said he was sick for about a week with two really bad days: “I couldn’t get off of the couch and had a fever, body aches, chills, heat flashes and intense fatigue. I lost my sense of taste and smell, which lasted for about three weeks.”

This month, he got covid again, despite two Pfizer doses and a Moderna booster shot.

“This one lasted around five days and included a constant runny nose, lots of sneezing, and overall just felt like a bad cold,” Canfield, 40, said.

Do people take more chances, or act more cautiously, after living through covid twice?

“I definitely feel more liberated because I think this means I won’t get it again for at least a little while since I have the antibodies,” Canfield said, adding that he still follows rules on mask-wearing. “Obviously, I’m not a scientist so I don’t know for sure, but it seems that way. … I don’t have as many worries now in regards to social distancing.”

Siqueira, on the other hand, said: “With so many new strains always popping up, I still don’t feel 100 percent secure. I still wear my mask and social distance.”

For the past two Christmases, Ana Siqueira has received the same unwanted gift: covid-19. And so has her husband. The one-two punch they experienced underscores the coronavirus’s staying power and ability to crack through the body’s defenses. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The first time Siqueira got the virus, one of her sons was isolating with covid at home, and Siqueira hadn’t been vaccinated.

But the second time, Siqueira, 57, a children’s book author and Spanish teacher from Palm Harbor, Fla., had checked all the boxes. She wore a mask in public, practiced social distancing and was vaccinated and boosted, but thinks she caught covid anyway during a family trip to see her daughter in Seattle. Most of the family got swept up with infections, she said.

Although statistically rare, virus reinfections have been rising recently, leading some states to track them separately. Infectious-disease experts say getting covid more than once will lose its novelty for Americans. Time and the virus are both working against people’s defenses, they said.

Immunity developed from a previous infection fades over time. As the coronavirus pandemic enters its third year, many people who once had natural immunity have lost it. Protection provided by vaccines also wanes, and even before that happens, infections are possible among vaccinated and boosted individuals.

The coronavirus, meanwhile, is mutating to more infectious forms such as the delta variant and, more recently, the highly transmissible omicron variant.

For Siqueira, her first bout included nausea, a low fever for a week and anxiety. “I also felt weak and fainted twice. … I felt very sleepy and tired for almost a month,” she said.

The second time: nausea and nasal congestion. “I didn’t even think I had covid,” Siqueira said. “My nausea lingered for about two weeks.”

Coronavirus cases spiked globally in the first weeks of 2022, despite record-high vaccination rates. Here’s how the omicron variant took off. (Video: Jackie Lay, John Farrell/The Washington Post)

An unvaccinated man in Texas with underlying health conditions previously diagnosed with covid-19 was the first omicron-related death identified in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an August study found that “being unvaccinated was associated with 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared with being fully vaccinated,” using data from Kentucky for May and June 2021 — and that was before the delta or omicron variants had taken hold.

In a separate study from December, the CDC investigated 43 of the earliest omicron variant cases in the United States and found that six, or 14 percent, involved reinfections. The CDC defines a reinfection as when someone tests positive for the coronavirus again more than three months after a previous positive test. States including Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Washington have begun to publish reinfection statistics after seeing large spikes in their populations last year.

Among the factors that can predict whether someone might be reinfected: the time since being vaccinated and changes to the virus.

“You put the two together, and you have more and more reinfections,” said Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic.

“As it stands right now, people who have had the infection or people who have received the vaccination do show substantial protection against hospitalization or repeat infection,” Esper said. “However, it doesn’t last forever. It goes down over time, and it goes down quicker if a new variant or new strain shows up which is completely different from the other strains, which is what omicron is.”

Oklahoma reported 148 reinfections in January 2021, a monthly total that grew to 1,213 in September. Washington state officials reported 4,404 reinfection cases from September to Dec. 26, of which 60 percent involved unvaccinated patients. Louisiana reports more than 47,000 reinfections out of more than 1 million cases since the start of the pandemic.

Health officials say these numbers probably underrepresent the true total for reinfections, because people with the coronavirus may be asymptomatic or may not be tested.

“COVID-19 reinfections do occur but are rarely identified. People with a reported reinfection make up 1.7% of all reported cases of COVID-19,” the Washington state health department says. “This is likely lower than the actual number of reinfections, but we do not have sufficient information to estimate the actual amount at this time.”

At a White House briefing Friday, Anthony S. Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden on the coronavirus, said most reinfections involve a different variant and that it is “extremely unlikely” to get the same strain more than once.

“There are reinfections, but it is unlikely that, if you mount a good immune response, at least over a period of several months, it is extremely unlikely that you will be reinfected with the same variant,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We’ve seen infections, but those are mostly in people who have been infected with alpha who then wind up getting infected with beta or reinfected with omicron.”

William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said reinfections are bound to occur because “this is not a virus that produces a durable, lifetime protection like measles does.” The coronavirus and its variants could be sticking around indefinitely, managed like the flu with a regularly updated vaccine, he said.

“There are a lot of people who would literally like to put covid behind them, to forget about it, and it will be difficult to get them to understand that they and their children will be coping with covid like we cope with influenza on an annual basis,” Schaffner said.

For Kevin Metz, his first infection was heralded in October 2020 by a burning sensation on his skin, followed later by a nagging cough, trouble breathing and sleeping, and other symptoms, requiring a cortisone inhaler. The second bout in recent weeks felt more like a “bad head cold,” he said.

Metz, 54, a party rental company owner from Yardley, Pa., and his wife have both been diagnosed with covid twice. His wife thinks she caught it the first time after visiting a niece and passed it on to Metz, and Metz thinks he caught the virus the second time from a friend at a basketball game over Christmas and passed it to his wife, he said. He and his wife are vaccinated but not boosted, Metz said.

During the most recent illness, Metz said, symptoms were “not feeling as severe,” though it was still four or five days of nausea, coughing, sore throat and a runny nose. After recovering, Metz felt newly protected from the virus and in the mood for an island vacation, “but we didn’t wind up going anywhere.”

“Once we got it, I’m like: ‘We’re free now, we can go anywhere,’ ” he recalled.

“She was a little more concerned about it,” Metz said of his wife.

The Food and Drug Administration on Monday took two monoclonal antibody therapies off the list of covid-19 treatments for now, saying the medications should not be used anywhere in the United States because they are ineffective against the dominant omicron variant. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services, which distributes covid treatments to states, notified state health officials that it has halted distribution of the antibody medications made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly, according to an email sent to the states and obtained by The Washington Post.

Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement that data show the two antibody treatments “are highly unlikely to be active against the omicron variant, which is circulating at a very high frequency throughout the United States.” Omicron is responsible for more than 99 percent of cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The FDA official said it is “highly unlikely that covid-19 patients seeking care in the U.S. at this time are infected with a variant other than omicron, and these treatments are not authorized to be used at this time.” Cavazzoni added the antibodies could be used again if a future variant emerges that is susceptible to the therapies.

Administration officials hope that ending federal distribution of the two monoclonal antibody treatments to the states will prevent covid-19 patients from being given drugs that do not work against omicron. Senior officials last week called health officials in several states to urge them to stop using the Regeneron and Lilly drugs and pointed them to alternatives.

Several treatments remain effective against omicron, including sotrovimab — a monoclonal antibody made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology — and antiviral pills by Pfizer and by Merck and its partner, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. In addition, the use of the antiviral drug remdesivir as an outpatient therapy recently got the green light from regulators.

However, several doctors and hospitals have complained that some of the covid treatments, including the Pfizer pill and sotrovimab, are in short supply.

Monoclonal antibodies are manufactured proteins that can enhance or mimic the immune system’s ability to fight viruses and other pathogens. But the highly mutated omicron variant has thwarted the ability of the Regeneron and Lilly therapies to work against the virus, the FDA noted.

The action on the monoclonal antibodies followed a move by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to set up new sites in his state that administer the treatments. DeSantis has said he is not convinced the therapies are ineffective against omicron and noted they work on cases caused by delta, the variant that previously was dominant.

DeSantis is a foe of vaccine mandates and has implied erroneously the shots might hurt fertility.

In an email last week, DeSantis’s spokeswoman, Christina Pushaw, said a small percentage of cases in Florida are still caused by delta. She also said lab tests showing the loss of effectiveness by Regeneron and Lilly against the omicron variant are “not conclusive.”

A Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions, expressed frustration Monday that some governors are still promoting ineffective medications.

“Frankly, at this stage, it’s dangerous that they would do that,” the official said. “It’s beyond irresponsible to use these products that aren’t without their own risks when we know they offer basically zero benefit.”

Last week, a treatment-guidelines committee at the National Institutes of Health discouraged use of the Regeneron and Lilly antibody drugs, saying they are “predicted to have markedly reduced activities” against omicron.

StarSolid StarSolid StarOutline StarOutline ( 2 stars ) For Iuli Gerbase’s debut feature, “The Pink Cloud,” the Brazilian writer-director decided to tell a lightly sci-fi-inflected story about a mysterious — and deadly — blush-colored fog that descends upon the globe. The extent of the phenomenon is unclear, but seems to be worldwide, based on glimpses of news reports.

In Gerbase’s telling, the titular miasma kills anyone who comes in contact with it in about 10 seconds, leading to the imposition of a mandatory quarantine. The vapor, whose origins and composition are left deliberately vague, is, for some reason — presumably necessitated by narrative convenience — unable to seep into homes, as oxygen is, via, say, air-conditioning ducts and other openings. “Why doesn’t it pass through the gaps?” a character wonders, early on, as he and the killer gas face off, through a pane of glass.

An excellent question, and one that’s reassuring to hear someone in the film articulate, even though Gerbase’s failure to answer it is annoying. What’s most intriguing about “The Pink Cloud,” whose premise plays out like a metaphor for covid-19 and lockdown, is that Gerbase wrote it in 2017 and shot the film two years later, well before the current health crisis.

Ah well, never mind about details. Gerbase is more interested in the effect of isolation on relationships. In that regard, “The Pink Cloud” is prescient and mildly affecting, if also susceptible to the question: Is it too soon to be watching a pandemic allegory while we’re still living through a pandemic?

To be sure, the film includes some nods to world-building outside the claustrophobic home in which it is set, where a one-night stand leads to the sudden, awkwardly enforced togetherness of a young woman named Giovana (Renata de Lélis) and her nightclub pickup Yago (Eduardo Mendonça). For example: The government announces that food and other necessities will henceforth be delivered via drone and deposited into residences through a plastic sleeve attached to a hole cut in window glass. As for who is manufacturing all these life-sustaining products — and shipping them from what Amazon-like distribution center — the film leaves all that to the imagination. Presumably, workers who were stranded at their workplaces when the cloud hit are still there, punching the clock. (And maybe sleeping on empty warehouse shelves? Who knows?) As far as commerce and money is concerned, Yago, a chiropractor, can’t ply his trade, for obvious reasons. But Giovana, a self-employed web designer who works from home, turns into the breadwinner for two.

Make that three.

Giovana and Yago are soon in the family way, in a story that covers many years, a bit too breezily, and many ups and downs in this couple’s growing — and entirely unexpected — family.

There is, however, an uncomfortable sense of verisimilitude to this parable of cabin fever, and the emotional twists and turns that occur between its protagonists. Giovana becomes addicted to her virtual-reality headset, setting up a fake beach — with real sand — in the living room, while Yago and their son, Lilo (played by several different child actors at various ages) become more complacent about their shared life in the bubble. Lilo, of course, has never known anything else, so it’s easier on him.

On us, the effect of watching “The Pink Cloud” may be different. It feels sharply, even painfully true, while also hazy and nonspecific. Its head is in the clouds, while its feet are grounded in the very real catastrophe we are all currently suffering through.

The U.S. Postal Service’s mission to deliver 500 million coronavirus test kits has cast it in an unprecedented role in the nation’s pandemic response just as covid-19 infections have peaked within its own ranks and its network is under immense strain. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Online orders began rolling in this week for the free rapid tests, which are scheduled to ship by the end of the month. The agency has hired thousands of seasonal workers and converted more than 40 facilities into ad hoc fulfillment centers in what experts have called the largest disaster-relief mobilization in its 247-year history.

The stakes for the country — and Postal Service — could hardly be higher. Americans are still struggling to access at-home coronavirus tests as the omicron variant is driving caseloads near record highs in parts of the country.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy hopes the test-kit assignment will relieve political heat on the agency caused by his controversial 10-year cost-cutting plan and its tumultuous performance during the 2020 presidential election — which was heavily reliant on mail-in ballots — according to four people familiar with his thinking. A good outcome could help the Postal Service win funding for a much-needed fleet of delivery trucks and restructure its massive debt burden.

Success, though, is far from assured, postal officials privately concede. The program requires the agency to take on entirely new duties and a fresh public face in the fight against the coronavirus. Test-kit processing snags, IT failures or delivery issues could set the agency’s reputation back decades.

And rising workforce quarantines and isolations have already affected mail service. On-time delivery rates for first-class mail fell to 84.5 percent the week of Jan. 14, the agency’s worst score since the pandemic began and well below its 95 percent target.

“Even if you know how to do it, it’s never been done before. A lot can go wrong,” said one senior postal official. “But if we can pull it off, wow.”

White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.

The undertaking, as well as a separate nonpostal effort to distribute 400 million high-quality N95 masks, is part of the Biden administration’s response to the omicron-powered coronavirus spike that caused nearly 9 million people to miss work in late December and early January.

Among them are the 19,742 postal workers in quarantine or isolation Friday after a positive test or exposure to the virus. It is the largest contingent to miss work since the pandemic began, according to the American Postal Workers Union.

What’s more, health officials at postal installations are so overwhelmed by employee reports of new cases that they’re unable to track and trace close contacts of newly infected individuals, or authorize those who have recovered to return to work. The issues are compounded, local union officials say, by other workers refusing to call in sick out of a fear of discipline.

Although the agency is set up to move billions of pieces of mail — letters, advertisements, ballots, parcels, even cremated remains — it has never managed its own off-the-shelf inventory or developed this kind of consumer-fulfillment operation.

This report is based on interviews with 32 current and former postal officials and agency employees, White House and union officials, and independent logistics and health experts. Many of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to give candid assessments of the administration’s and Postal Service’s preparedness for the test-kit shipment program.

Observers say the Postal Service is working furiously to retain seasonal employees for the campaign and reconfiguring its sprawling transportation network to handle the parcels. Agency leaders appear cautiously optimistic about the program, according to seven people directly involved with the effort, though worries persist about the wobbly postal IT system and rising workforce infections.

Rank-and-file workers report enthusiasm for the project even as regional supervisors have yet to receive instructions on how local postal facilities will handle the tidal wave of incoming test packets.

“The 650,000 women and men of the United States Postal Service are ready to deliver and proud to play a critical role in supporting the health needs of the American public,” DeJoy said in a statement. “We have been working closely with the administration and are well prepared to accept and deliver test kits on the first day the program launches.”

Scaling up operations

As a wave of omicron variant infections swept the country last month, White House officials originally scoffed at the idea of mailing test kits to American homes. They changed tack weeks later.

Postal officials were giddy about the decision, said four people involved with the plans. DeJoy, long a President Biden foil, was intensely involved in conceiving the Postal Service’s logistics footprint, the people said, drawing on his private-sector experience.

The agency has converted 43 package sorting plants launched during the holiday season to store and process the test kits, and extended the contracts of 8,000 seasonal employees to staff those sites, according to union officials. It plans to ship 2 million packages — each holding four test kits — every day.

Seasonal employees will work on 75-day renewable contracts; the Postal Service anticipates scaling down the operation by mid-April, though its future is largely dependent on the pandemic’s course and how the White House chooses to distribute an additional 500 million test kits.

The administration has so far not commented on how it plans to provide those tests.

“The strategies that yielded improvements to our peak season performance will allow the Postal Service to distribute test kits efficiently nationwide,” agency spokesman David Partenheimer said in a statement. “These strategies, including additional staffing, an investment in new processing equipment and operational efficiencies, and an expanded facility footprint, mean test kits can get to the Americans who want them in a timely and efficient manner.”

Postal workers will manage and track the inventory of tests. Agency engineers will oversee the customer ordering process, which generates mailing labels and postage for each package. Then postal staff will “pick and pack” test kits into parcels, reminiscent of a private-sector e-commerce operation.

It sounds easy, industry experts said. It is not. The program requires accountability for each test kit, not just each mailed parcel. The software behind customers’ test-kit order form must integrate with operations from the 43 package annexes. And the Postal Service needs to extend commitments for trucking and freight air contractors to ensure tests are delivered in one to three days.

Test kits shipped within the contiguous United States will be delivered via first-class package service, and those sent to Alaska, Hawaii, offshore territories and foreign-based military and State Department employees will be via priority mail, Partenheimer said.

The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Postal Service for its costs, said Partenheimer and HHS spokeswoman Kirsten Allen, though neither specified an amount.

Success, experts say, is highly dependent on the Postal Service’s IT system — which the agency declined to discuss — and its staffing capability.

“If they have to get something to everybody, they have the obvious, obvious infrastructure to do it. But I think the challenge remains getting it into the system,” said Leo Raymond, managing director of Mailers Hub, an organization that provides market information and support for commercial mailers. “It’s not whether they can deliver it. It’s the logistics of getting it to the delivery resource. That’s where the trick comes in.”

‘I’m sick, you’re sick, what are we going to do?’

Mounting covid-19 infections among postal staff remain a wild card. According to interviews with 13 postal workers and union officials in 11 states, the agency’s pandemic response has been uneven and largely left to local supervisors.

Al Friedman, president of the Florida State Association of Letter Carriers, said he has fielded more than 100 calls from workers and shop stewards since early January with reports of postal workers being required to continue working despite showing coronavirus symptoms.

As a wave of infections swept through one Pennsylvania office, one transportation manager rushed to shore up mail shipment plans before their own covid-19 symptoms worsened. Elsewhere in the facility, colleagues who were not eligible for more than a few days of sick leave kept at the job, wary that a week’s worth of isolation could lead to discipline.

“My manager called me and said, ‘I’m sick, you’re sick, what are we going to do?’ the person said. “Everybody is at the point where they’re scared to take off work. … I know I definitely got it at work, because this is the only place that I go.”

In Fremont, Ohio, infections sidelined 14 of the 50 employees at the local post office, said Jennifer Lemke, executive vice president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 170.

Postal health officials in the district, which serves Toledo and Cleveland, have been swamped with new cases and have not been able to track and trace new infections, or approve workers to return to their posts.

Return-to-work guides circulated to supervisors and union officials and obtained by The Washington Post have caused more confusion.

One guide, distributed Jan. 5, says employees who are staying home because they are symptomatic but have not tested positive for the virus can return upon satisfying three criteria. The document, however, lists only two succeeding items.

Another guide, updated Jan. 16, instructs supervisors to conduct a “verbal discussion with the employee” before referring their case to Postal Service occupational health nurse administrators. The guide specifically prohibits supervisors from taking “any written notes” from these conversations.

The absence of clear instruction has employees returning to work — or remaining on leave — on their own timelines, Lemke said.

“It ranges all over the place,” she said. “We have one employee that said, ‘Hey I’ve been out five days, I have no symptoms, I’ll come back to work, but I’ll wear a mask.’ But masks are sort of a new thing here.”

Partenheimer, the postal spokesman, said that the agency’s pandemic mitigation plans — which include social distancing when appropriate, a “liberal” covid-19 leave policy, distribution of personal protective equipment and more frequent facility cleanings — “continue to perform well.”

The agency mandates mask-wearing in jurisdictions that have their own mask mandates, Partenheimer said. Masks are required for nonpublic-facing employees who cannot maintain social distance in the workplace.

Some workers and union officials had hoped that the Postal Service would move quickly to comply with the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-weekly-test requirement for large employers to stem the growing number of infections, but the U.S. Supreme Court largely struck down that policy earlier this month. Although postal workers are government employees, the agency does not fall under a similar Biden policy in place for federal workers and contractors.

Instead, the Postal Service asked for a temporary waiver from the vaccine-or-test policy, citing concerns that it would be “likely to result in the loss of many employees — either by employees leaving or being disciplined.”

DeJoy and seven of the eight members of the agency’s governing board confirmed to The Post that they had been fully vaccinated. The board’s longest-serving member, Republican Robert M. Duncan, and Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino did not respond to requests for comment.

Partenheimer said postal workers are not “currently” required to be vaccinated or provide evidence of negative coronavirus tests as a condition of employment.

Still, postal workers said they were optimistic about the Postal Service’s ability to distribute the test kits. The mail service is at its highest staffing complement in recent memory after DeJoy instructed hiring managers to begin onboarding holiday seasonal workers months earlier than in years past. And even with infections rising, workers say morale is high.

“There isn’t really another infrastructure in place in the country that will do what we do,” said one letter carrier in Los Angeles. “The core value of the Postal Service to begin with is [delivery to] every address, every day, to keep every community and every business and every [person] off the grid connected to the world, if they want to be. In those corners, there isn’t another way to do it. It’s kind of what we signed up for.”

Federal regulators Friday approved the use of the antiviral drug remdesivir for covid-19 outpatients at high risk of being hospitalized, providing a new treatment option for doctors struggling with shortages of effective drugs to counter the coronavirus. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Food and Drug Administration said the intravenous treatment, which had been limited to patients in the hospital, could be administered to outpatients with mild-to-moderate illness.

Remdesivir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, was among the first coronavirus treatments authorized in 2020. The drug received full agency approval later that year for people 12 and older. Treatment of younger children is permitted under an emergency use authorization, but Friday’s expansion to outpatients includes both age groups.

The FDA action was welcomed by physicians scrambling to keep covid patients out of the hospital as waves of infections crowd medical facilities. Among the hurdles for doctors: Two of the three authorized monoclonal antibody treatments are ineffective against omicron; there are shortages of the one antibody drug that still works; and demand for recently cleared antiviral pills sharply exceeds supply.

“The good news is it’s another tool in the treatment toolbox,” said Helen Boucher, an infectious-disease physician and interim dean for Tufts University School of Medicine.

Tufts began offering remdesivir, also called Veklury, on an outpatient basis late last year, Boucher said. Several other large medical centers also are administering it.

Because the medication had been approved for inpatient care, physicians are permitted to prescribe it “off-label” for patients not in the hospital. Boucher said she expects many more doctors and hospitals to begin treating outpatients with the medication now that the FDA has explicitly approved use for outpatients.

David Boulware, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said the expanded FDA clearance was important to ensure reimbursement from Medicare and private insurers. Sometimes, payers are reluctant to cover medications used off-label.

Boulware noted, however, that using the medication in an outpatient setting has logistical challenges.

“It is possible, but three daily infusions now make the one-time monoclonal antibody infusion seem simple,” Boulware said.

For the remdesivir treatment, patients must go to a clinic or hospital three days in a row, which may be difficult for some people. And the drug must be administered by skilled staff, which can present a logistical challenge as many hospitals are hobbled by personnel shortages.

The FDA action Friday followed recent publication of a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed remdesivir can be beneficial when given on an outpatient basis. The study found that the drug reduced hospitalization and death by 87 percent when given soon after a coronavirus diagnosis compared with patients who did not get the drug.

The findings from the study are based on research that predates the delta variant, which spread quickly during summer, and omicron, which is now responsible for more than 95 percent of coronavirus cases in the United States. But researchers have said remdesivir will probably remain effective even as omicron proves resistant to some monoclonal antibody therapies.

The findings were based on a study, sponsored by Gilead, involving 562 unvaccinated coronavirus patients from September 2020 to April 2021, who were randomly selected to receive the three-day infusion therapy or a placebo.

All of the participants were at high risk for developing a severe case because they were 60 or older, or had at least one other condition that makes the coronavirus more dangerous, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or obesity.

The FDA said in a statement the treatment is not a substitute for vaccines, which remain the most potent protection against coronavirus.

But along with the two new anti-covid pills, the broader use of remdesivir will “bolster the arsenal of therapeutics to treat covid-19 and respond to the surge of the omicron variant,” Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said. She added that the drug can be administered at “skilled nursing facilities, home health-care settings and outpatient facilities such as infusion centers.”

Tufts’ Boucher said her hospital is administering remdesivir in an outpatient respiratory infection clinic originally set up for the monoclonal antibody therapies. Other large medical centers also already use remdesivir on an outpatient basis, she said.

Updated treatment guidelines issued earlier this week by the National Institutes of Health for outpatients with mild-to-moderate covid encourage use of remdesivir, while noting that the FDA had not yet authorized it for those patients.

The guidelines also recommend use of a monoclonal antibody, called sotrovimab, that is effective against omicron. That medication is given as a single intravenous infusion as soon as possible after onset of symptoms and within 10 days of symptom onset. It is made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology.

Also recommended are two newly authorized pills to treat the coronavirus — one by Pfizer, and the other by Merck and its partner, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. But those oral medications, like sotrovimab, are in short supply.

The guidelines discouraged use of two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments authorized for early stage coronavirus because the therapies probably will not work against the omicron variant. The guidelines said monoclonal antibody therapies by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly “are predicted to have markedly reduced activities” against omicron.

The U.S. Postal Service’s mission to deliver 500 million coronavirus test kits has cast it in an unprecedented role in the nation’s pandemic response just as covid-19 infections have peaked within its own ranks and its network is under immense strain. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Online orders began rolling in this week for the free rapid tests, which are scheduled to ship by the end of the month. The agency has hired thousands of seasonal workers and converted more than 40 facilities into ad hoc fulfillment centers in what experts have called the largest disaster-relief mobilization in its 247-year history.

The stakes for the country — and Postal Service — could hardly be higher. Americans are still struggling to access at-home coronavirus tests as the omicron variant is driving caseloads near record highs in parts of the country.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy hopes the test-kit assignment will relieve political heat on the agency caused by his controversial 10-year cost-cutting plan and its tumultuous performance during the 2020 presidential election — which was heavily reliant on mail-in ballots — according to four people familiar with his thinking. A good outcome could help the Postal Service win funding for a much-needed fleet of delivery trucks and restructure its massive debt burden.

Success, though, is far from assured, postal officials privately concede. The program requires the agency to take on entirely new duties and a fresh public face in the fight against the coronavirus. Test-kit processing snags, IT failures or delivery issues could set the agency’s reputation back decades.

And rising workforce quarantines and isolations have already affected mail service. On-time delivery rates for first-class mail fell to 84.5 percent the week of Jan. 14, the agency’s worst score since the pandemic began and well below its 95 percent target.

“Even if you know how to do it, it’s never been done before. A lot can go wrong,” said one senior postal official. “But if we can pull it off, wow.”

White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.

The undertaking, as well as a separate nonpostal effort to distribute 400 million high-quality N95 masks, is part of the Biden administration’s response to the omicron-powered coronavirus spike that caused nearly 9 million people to miss work in late December and early January.

Among them are the 19,742 postal workers in quarantine or isolation Friday after a positive test or exposure to the virus. It is the largest contingent to miss work since the pandemic began, according to the American Postal Workers Union.

What’s more, health officials at postal installations are so overwhelmed by employee reports of new cases that they’re unable to track and trace close contacts of newly infected individuals, or authorize those who have recovered to return to work. The issues are compounded, local union officials say, by other workers refusing to call in sick out of a fear of discipline.

Although the agency is set up to move billions of pieces of mail — letters, advertisements, ballots, parcels, even cremated remains — it has never managed its own off-the-shelf inventory or developed this kind of consumer-fulfillment operation.

This report is based on interviews with 32 current and former postal officials and agency employees, White House and union officials, and independent logistics and health experts. Many of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to give candid assessments of the administration’s and Postal Service’s preparedness for the test-kit shipment program.

Observers say the Postal Service is working furiously to retain seasonal employees for the campaign and reconfiguring its sprawling transportation network to handle the parcels. Agency leaders appear cautiously optimistic about the program, according to seven people directly involved with the effort, though worries persist about the wobbly postal IT system and rising workforce infections.

Rank-and-file workers report enthusiasm for the project even as regional supervisors have yet to receive instructions on how local postal facilities will handle the tidal wave of incoming test packets.

“The 650,000 women and men of the United States Postal Service are ready to deliver and proud to play a critical role in supporting the health needs of the American public,” DeJoy said in a statement. “We have been working closely with the administration and are well prepared to accept and deliver test kits on the first day the program launches.”

Scaling up operations

As a wave of omicron variant infections swept the country last month, White House officials originally scoffed at the idea of mailing test kits to American homes. They changed tack weeks later.

Postal officials were giddy about the decision, said four people involved with the plans. DeJoy, long a President Biden foil, was intensely involved in conceiving the Postal Service’s logistics footprint, the people said, drawing on his private-sector experience.

The agency has converted 43 package sorting plants launched during the holiday season to store and process the test kits, and extended the contracts of 8,000 seasonal employees to staff those sites, according to union officials. It plans to ship 2 million packages — each holding four test kits — every day.

Seasonal employees will work on 75-day renewable contracts; the Postal Service anticipates scaling down the operation by mid-April, though its future is largely dependent on the pandemic’s course and how the White House chooses to distribute an additional 500 million test kits.

The administration has so far not commented on how it plans to provide those tests.

“The strategies that yielded improvements to our peak season performance will allow the Postal Service to distribute test kits efficiently nationwide,” agency spokesman David Partenheimer said in a statement. “These strategies, including additional staffing, an investment in new processing equipment and operational efficiencies, and an expanded facility footprint, mean test kits can get to the Americans who want them in a timely and efficient manner.”

Advertisement

Postal workers will manage and track the inventory of tests. Agency engineers will oversee the customer ordering process, which generates mailing labels and postage for each package. Then postal staff will “pick and pack” test kits into parcels, reminiscent of a private-sector e-commerce operation.

It sounds easy, industry experts said. It is not. The program requires accountability for each test kit, not just each mailed parcel. The software behind customers’ test-kit order form must integrate with operations from the 43 package annexes. And the Postal Service needs to extend commitments for trucking and freight air contractors to ensure tests are delivered in one to three days.

Test kits shipped within the contiguous United States will be delivered via first-class package service, and those sent to Alaska, Hawaii, offshore territories and foreign-based military and State Department employees will be via priority mail, Partenheimer said.

The Department of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Postal Service for its costs, said Partenheimer and HHS spokeswoman Kirsten Allen, though neither specified an amount.

Success, experts say, is highly dependent on the Postal Service’s IT system — which the agency declined to discuss — and its staffing capability.

“If they have to get something to everybody, they have the obvious, obvious infrastructure to do it. But I think the challenge remains getting it into the system,” said Leo Raymond, managing director of Mailers Hub, an organization that provides market information and support for commercial mailers. “It’s not whether they can deliver it. It’s the logistics of getting it to the delivery resource. That’s where the trick comes in.”

‘I’m sick, you’re sick, what are we going to do?’

Mounting covid-19 infections among postal staff remain a wild card. According to interviews with 13 postal workers and union officials in 11 states, the agency’s pandemic response has been uneven and largely left to local supervisors.

Advertisement

Al Friedman, president of the Florida State Association of Letter Carriers, said he has fielded more than 100 calls from workers and shop stewards since early January with reports of postal workers being required to continue working despite showing coronavirus symptoms.

As a wave of infections swept through one Pennsylvania office, one transportation manager rushed to shore up mail shipment plans before their own covid-19 symptoms worsened. Elsewhere in the facility, colleagues who were not eligible for more than a few days of sick leave kept at the job, wary that a week’s worth of isolation could lead to discipline.

“My manager called me and said, ‘I’m sick, you’re sick, what are we going to do?’ the person said. “Everybody is at the point where they’re scared to take off work. … I know I definitely got it at work, because this is the only place that I go.”

In Fremont, Ohio, infections sidelined 14 of the 50 employees at the local post office, said Jennifer Lemke, executive vice president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 170.

Postal health officials in the district, which serves Toledo and Cleveland, have been swamped with new cases and have not been able to track and trace new infections, or approve workers to return to their posts.

Return-to-work guides circulated to supervisors and union officials and obtained by The Washington Post have caused more confusion.

One guide, distributed Jan. 5, says employees who are staying home because they are symptomatic but have not tested positive for the virus can return upon satisfying three criteria. The document, however, lists only two succeeding items.

Another guide, updated Jan. 16, instructs supervisors to conduct a “verbal discussion with the employee” before referring their case to Postal Service occupational health nurse administrators. The guide specifically prohibits supervisors from taking “any written notes” from these conversations.

The absence of clear instruction has employees returning to work — or remaining on leave — on their own timelines, Lemke said.

“It ranges all over the place,” she said. “We have one employee that said, ‘Hey I’ve been out five days, I have no symptoms, I’ll come back to work, but I’ll wear a mask.’ But masks are sort of a new thing here.”

Partenheimer, the postal spokesman, said that the agency’s pandemic mitigation plans — which include social distancing when appropriate, a “liberal” covid-19 leave policy, distribution of personal protective equipment and more frequent facility cleanings — “continue to perform well.”

The agency mandates mask-wearing in jurisdictions that have their own mask mandates, Partenheimer said. Masks are required for nonpublic-facing employees who cannot maintain social distance in the workplace.

The first sign that something still wasn’t quite right with ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith came in the initial moments of his “First Take” show Monday morning. He was uncharacteristically soft-spoken, calming himself every time his voice rose as he spoke about Sunday’s loss by the Dallas Cowboys, the team he loves to troll, in an NFL playoff game. He mentioned that doctors had cautioned him to tone it down a bit, and he coughed a few times, too.

Later on the show, he explained that the reason for that and his recent absence had been a case of covid-19 that “almost took me out,” landing him in a hospital. Although in many cases the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has led to less severe bouts of covid-19, “for me personally, it hit me differently,” Smith said.

“[Doctors] told me, had I not been vaccinated, I wouldn’t be here. That’s how bad I was,” he said. “I had pneumonia in both lungs. My liver was bad, and it ravaged me to the point where even now I have to monitor my volume, got to get in the gym every day, walk before you run, work your way back, because I’m still not 100 percent with my lungs.”

Smith, who originally announced to his audience Dec. 21 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, added that, although his lungs still haven’t completely healed, his most recent coronavirus test results are negative and he is “on the road to recovery.”

Smith said that at one point he had a fever of 103 degrees, “woke up with chills and [in] a pool of sweat, headaches were massive, coughing profusely,” and he rang in the new year in a hospital. Smith credited his doctors and the vaccine for his recovery.

“I wanted to take a moment to say to folks out there that (a) the vaccine, according to [doctors], saved me,” he said. “Now, everybody’s different, because my sister smokes and she had covid and she was fine in three days — three, four days. Me? I don’t smoke, and it almost took me out.”

""And they told me had I not been vaccinated, I wouldn't be here. That's how bad I was.""

Smith, who said in September that he had “reservations” about getting vaccinated even as he advocated for it, also urged people to wear masks.

“I think the one thing to emphasize the importance of, no matter how you feel about the vaccine, that mask is important,” he said, “because you don’t know how the next person is affected. How I’m affected is different from how you were affected.”

And while it was irritating for him to tone it down about the Cowboys’ loss, he was happy to be on the air talking about it.

“I’ve missed being at work. I’ve used more sick days in the last month than I’ve used in my 28-year career in this business,” he said, “and I can’t tell you how lucky and sincerely blessed I am to be sitting here with you guys [Monday], because 2½, three weeks ago, I didn’t know if I was going to make it.”

A coalition of hundreds of doctors and public health experts have called out Spotify for allowing Joe Rogan to spread “false and societally harmful assertions” about the coronavirus and vaccination on the streaming platform that hosts his wildly popular podcast. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In an open letter published Monday, more than 270 medical professionals urge Spotify to stop “enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance.” Rogan, whose show reaches an estimated audience of 11 million people an episode, has repeatedly downplayed the need for coronavirus vaccines and used his platform to flirt with misinformation about covid-19.

“Though Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, the company presently has no misinformation policy,” the group wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Rolling Stone this week. “Throughout the covid-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine.”

Although the coalition is not asking for Spotify to cancel “The Joe Rogan Experience,” the group is pushing for the company to do more to prevent further misinformation from spreading on what is considered the nation’s most popular podcast. Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s School of Public Health who signed the letter, told The Washington Post that the group of medical professionals came together to “fight against this tidal wave of misinformation” broadcast on Rogan’s show.

“I actually think he’s a menace to public health because he speaks on things that have no scientific backing,” she said Friday.

Neither representatives for Rogan nor Spotify immediately returned requests for comment early Friday.

Spotify has previously removed other episodes from hosts on its platform who have spread covid misinformation but have not done so with Rogan. Spotify has deleted 40 unrelated episodes of Rogan’s show from its service, including one featuring Alex Jones, who has pushed the false theory that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. But Spotify did not pull an April 2021 episode in which Rogan actively discouraged young people from getting vaccinated, saying, “If you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go ‘no.’ ”

The company said in a statement to the Verge in April: “Spotify prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health. When content that violates this standard is identified it is removed from the platform.”

The letter comes as misinformation around the virus and vaccination continues to spread throughout the United States. As the highly transmissible omicron variant has surged in recent months, anti-vaccine influencers have pushed falsehoods in many corners of life, including the wellness world and pregnancy apps.

Rogan, a stand-up comedian and color commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is a lightning rod with a huge following. Spotify acquired Rogan’s podcast library in 2020 in a reported $100 million deal.

The podcast host has previously lambasted the push for mass vaccinations and vaccine requirements for event spaces. When Rogan announced in September that he tested positive for coronavirus, he said he was using a number of therapeutics and treatments, including the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which the Food and Drug Administration has strongly recommended against using to prevent or treat covid.

Doctors and medical professionals who signed the letter took umbrage with one recent episode in particular featuring Robert Malone, a physician who bills himself as having played a key role in the creation of mRNA vaccines. Malone has since become a prominent skeptic of the coronavirus vaccines that have been crafted using the technology, often “promoting baseless conspiracy theories,” according to the coalition.

Malone used Rogan’s platform to promote “an unfounded theory that societal leaders have ‘hypnotized’ the public,” the group wrote, adding that the physician’s false claim has been debunked.

“Notably, Dr. Malone is one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the Holocaust,” the letter adds. “These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous.”

Wallace said the decision to publish the letter came after some members in the group had difficulty reporting the Malone episode to Spotify. The epidemiologist said that specific episode from Rogan’s show was emailed to her by hundreds of people outraged at Malone’s falsehoods.

“All of us in the science world were sort of like, ‘What is going on?’ ” she told The Post. “We realized that he has a platform this size, and there is nothing on Spotify that has a clear policy to moderate misinformation on the platform.”

The spread of misinformation on podcasts continues to be a challenge for companies like Spotify, said Valerie Wirtschafter, a senior data analyst at the Brookings Institution. Wirtschafter co-authored a report published this month that found how election falsehoods surged on political podcasts in the weeks before the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. She told The Post that the issue at Spotify over Rogan’s show is one that pits public health against economic incentives.

“It seems to me that Spotify tends to be a bit reactive instead of proactive when there is public attention and outcry, so having this group come together is a good thing,” she said. “I think that Joe Rogan is obviously a big culprit in this conversation about misinformation, but he’s not the only one. He’s far from the only one.”

On social media, some said the letter is yet another reason Spotify needed to enforce more guidelines on Rogan, while conservatives such as political commentator Ben Shapiro were quick to defend the host.

“I assure all of those — particularly those in the media — calling for Joe Rogan’s censorship, Joe is laughing at you,” Shapiro tweeted Friday. “And he should be.”

Since the letter was published, Wallace said she has received misogynistic and sexual harassment in direct messages from Rogan supporters, who have ridiculed her appearance.

“I’m used to getting harassment from anti-vaxxers and covid deniers, but this is a whole other level,” she said.

Rogan’s critics cheered when the host was fact-checked on-air about vaccination by a guest on his show recently. When Rogan claimed Wednesday there was more of an adverse risk of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, in children who were vaccinated, compared with those infected with the coronavirus, Australian media personality Josh Szeps said the opposite was true.

“I don’t think that’s true,” Rogan said.

“It is,” Szeps replied.

After Rogan asked a producer to “look that up,” they found an article published in the British science journal the New Scientist that supported what Szeps was saying.

“That’s interesting,” Rogan said. “That is not what I’ve read before.”

Some critics, such as epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, noted how “the goal post moving of Joe Rogan after getting fact checked live” was “incredible.”

“Please #vaccinate, don’t risk COVID,” he wrote.

Rogan took to Twitter late Thursday to address a clip of their exchange that had already been shared about 4 million times.

“If anyone was going to make me look dumb on the podcast I’m glad it’s @joshzepps because I love him, and he’s awesome,” Rogan tweeted. “That video is cringey, but it’s what happens when you stumble in a long form podcast when you didn’t know a subject was going to come up and you wing it.”

He concluded: “I’m sure I’ll stumble again in the future, but I honestly do my best to get things correct.”

Pregnant women who are unvaccinated against the coronavirus are not only more likely to be hospitalized for covid-19, but also at more risk of seeing their newborns die less than a month after birth, according to a peer-reviewed study in Scotland that was published Thursday. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The study was released in Nature Medicine, a monthly journal. The authors looked at more than 144,000 pregnancy records going back to March 2020, when the first coronavirus case was detected in Scotland.

But the authors focused on data between December 2020 and October last year because that was when vaccine shots and tests were more widely available. During that period, the unvaccinated made up 77 percent of all pregnant women who were infected and more than 90 percent who required hospitalization and critical care.

All the infant deaths examined in the study occurred for mothers who had not been vaccinated at the time of their covid-19 diagnoses, the authors said.

The results add urgency to vaccination efforts to protect both parents and babies during the remainder of the pandemic, the authors said: “Our findings emphasize the need for continued efforts to increase vaccination uptake in pregnant women. … Vaccine hesitancy in pregnancy thus requires addressing.”

Pregnant people initially received inconsistent advice about whether and when to get vaccinated, in part because they were not included in initial coronavirus vaccine trials. In April, health officials in the United Kingdom and the United States began to actively encourage vaccination during pregnancy.

The risk of stillbirth or neonatal death — defined as the death of a baby less than a month old — appeared to be highest among women who delivered within four weeks of the onset of infection, the study said. The risks were more than four times higher than those for babies born among the general population.

The study found that vaccine coverage was lower among pregnant women than for women in the general population, as has also been documented in the United States. For instance, less than a third of women who gave birth in October had had two vaccine doses, when more than three-quarters of women in the general population had gotten two.

The Scottish study echoes what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published earlier this month and comes as misinformation about vaccination during pregnancy has been spreading widely.

The CDC conducted a retrospective study on more than 40,000 pregnant women and concluded in January that vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased risk for preterm birth, defined as prior to completing 37 weeks of pregnancy, or with giving birth to “small-for-gestational-age” babies.

“CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for women who are pregnant, recently pregnant, who are trying to become pregnant now, or who might become pregnant,” the agency says.

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) announced late Tuesday that he is “extremely unwell” after testing positive for the coronavirus, forcing him to postpone his State of the State address. Justice, who is vaccinated and boosted, said in a news release that although he was “surprised” he tested positive, he was “thankful to the Lord above that I’ve been vaccinated, I’ve been boosted, and that I have an incredible support system, especially my loving family.”

“That being said, I feel extremely unwell at this point, and I have no choice but to postpone my State of the State address to the Legislature,” he said. He added that his wife, first lady Cathy Justice, tested negative.

The governor is experiencing moderate symptoms, such as congestion, coughing, a headache and a fever, and is isolating at home, his office said. The 70-year-old is being given a monoclonal antibody treatment prescribed by his physicians.

Clay Marsh, the state’s covid-19 czar, said Justice “took the exact right course of action” by testing when he showed a virus-related symptom.

“I have full confidence that Governor Justice will recover quickly, and it’s because he chose to receive the covid-19 vaccine and his booster shot,” said Marsh, the vice president and executive dean for health sciences at West Virginia University. “Without the immunity afforded by those vaccines, his outcome could be much worse.”

A spokesperson with the governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.

The governor’s positive test comes as the omicron variant continues to infect Americans in record numbers, regardless of vaccination status. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, said Tuesday that omicron will infect “just about everybody,” but he reiterated that the unvaccinated are 20 times likelier to die, 17 times likelier to be hospitalized and 10 times likelier to be infected than the vaccinated.

“Those who are still unvaccinated are going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he said at a Senate hearing, referring to the omicron surge. “And although it is less severe on a case-by-case basis, when you quantitatively have so many people who are infected, a fraction of them … are going to die,” he said.

As the surge that began at the end of 2021 has carried over into 2022, there is some optimism in regard to vaccination and testing. Pfizer is racing ahead with plans to manufacture 50 million to 100 million doses of a new omicron-specific version of its coronavirus vaccine by the spring. The White House is promising to provide 10 million free coronavirus tests each month for schools, aiming to help keep classes in person at a time when testing across the country is uneven and, in some cases, virtually nonexistent.

West Virginia is averaging 3,300 new infections a day, an increase, compared with the past seven days, according to data tracked by The Washington Post. While deaths and hospitalizations are also up in the state, they are not increasing at the same rate as cases.

As of Wednesday, 55 percent of the state is fully vaccinated, which trails the national rate of 63 percent.

Justice was lauded early in the pandemic for helping to make West Virginia a leader in vaccinations. But health officials noted last year that the state had hit a wall of vaccine resistance and misinformation, causing record hospitalizations and a vaccination rate that, at the time, was the lowest in the nation.

For months, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) has used a mix of warnings and incentives to plead with residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)

While the governor did not support President Biden’s plan to vaccinate millions of American workers, he has repeatedly pleaded with residents to get vaccinated against the virus. Last February, he assailed long-term care workers who declined the vaccine, calling them “asinine.” When his state was conducting lotteries to reward vaccine recipients — he encouraged people to “Do It For Babydog,” his English bulldog — Justice began suggesting that the unvaccinated were taking part in a different type of lottery: one involving death.

“When you turn your back and say, ‘Nope, I’m not doing that,’ all you’re doing is entering the death drawing,” Justice said in June.

After he woke up Tuesday morning with congestion and a cough, he developed a headache and a fever, Justice said. Although his rapid test came back negative, his symptoms worsened by Tuesday afternoon.

“My blood pressure and heart rate were extremely elevated, and I had a high fever,” he said in the news release.

He got back the results of a PCR test Tuesday evening that confirmed what he suspected: He tested positive for coronavirus.

Because Justice will be unable to give the West Virginia State of State address, it will be delivered by written message to the state legislature Wednesday to satisfy constitutional requirements, the governor’s office said.

Marsh, the state’s leading expert on covid, said West Virginians should look at Justice’s case as another reason to get vaccinated.

“I continue to strongly encourage all West Virginians to take the COVID-19 vaccine and get boosted when it’s time to do so,” Marsh said in a statement. “Everyone is susceptible to this infection, and with cases in the U.S. and in West Virginia at all-time highs, there has never been a more important time to get yourself and your family vaccinated.”

After describing himself as “extremely unwell,” the governor reflected on the thousands of residents in his state who have died of the coronavirus since 2020.

“I ask everyone to continue praying for the 5,452 great West Virginians that we’ve lost,” he said. “We need to keep pulling the rope together. We’re going to get through this and put an end to this terrible pandemic once and for all.”

In their never-ending quest to prove that everyone except them is overreacting to the pandemic, critics of the government’s response have seized upon new data that speaks to one of their long-standing claims. That claim says covid-19 hospitalization data conflates people who are in the hospital because of a coronavirus infection and those who are there with such an infection. In other words, you go to the emergency room because you broke your leg but, while there, test positive for the coronavirus.

The new data comes from New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) has begun reporting precisely this divide.

“I wanted to drill down into those numbers,” Hochul said at a news conference last week. “ … I have two days’ metrics right now, and looking at just the 4th of January, we realized that 39 percent of the people are hospitalized with non-covid related reasons and checking in yesterday’s number, that number was actually 42 percent.”

Advertisement

In other words, for every 10 people reported as having covid in New York hospitals, four were admitted for something other than covid.

An interesting and obviously important bit of information, but what does it actually tell us? Does it reinforce the idea that everyone is overreacting?

In short, no.

First, it’s not clear how representative is the New York data. Is this a similar pattern to what we’ve seen nationally since the pandemic began? A function of the increased transmissibility of the omicron variant? Related to broad adoption of vaccines that might limit symptoms? It’s not clear.

If we assume, for the sake of argument, that the 42 percent figure is and has been consistent, we can adjust our hospitalization data accordingly. Now, the three central metrics of the pandemic — cases, hospitalizations and deaths — look like this.

Why is that useful? Because it reflects the obvious point that hospitalizations are still correlated to the number of newly reported cases and, more important, the number of deaths. When one goes up, the others go up.

If the number of covid hospitalizations is being inflated by people who are asymptomatic but there for other reasons, that actually suggests that the virus is more deadly, not less. After all, if you’re hospitalized for, say, an appendectomy, you’re not likely to die. If you also have covid, that might be flagged as a covid hospitalization that ends up in the didn’t-die column.

If we compare the number of covid deaths to 58 percent of the total number of hospitalizations (assuming that 42 percent are not a function of a coronavirus infection), we’re reducing the denominator. Two divided by 10 is 20 percent; 2 divided by 6 is 33 percent.

If we look at the link between deaths and hospitalizations a week prior, the percentage of adjusted covid hospitalizations that led to deaths is higher than the raw count.

It’s clear that this sort of broad categorization probably does affect the numbers (though, again, the numbers do track with confirmed infections and deaths). If we take the Department of Health and Human Services’s data on hospital utilization and look at the total percentage of beds in use and those in use for covid, we see a weird pattern.

When covid cases increase nationally, so does the percentage of beds in use for covid — though, often, the total number of beds doesn’t change much.

There are a few possible reasons for this. One is that, as coronavirus infections increase, we get more of these incidentally detected infections at hospitals. More infections in the community, more likelihood that people are asymptomatically infected. Another is that surges in coronavirus cases limit the ability of hospitals to handle patients, so some hospitals divert space that would be used for surgery recuperation, etc., to treat covid infections. Same number of beds, different use.

If we apply our rough 42 percent metric here, the non-covid line gets a bit flatter. In other words, we’ve carving out 42 percent of the capacity in use for covid and giving it to the non-covid-prompted column. You can clearly see the drop in cases in the middle of last year, before the emergence of the delta variant — and that, from that point until late last year, the non-covid percentage of hospitalizations (when adjusted) was fairly stable.

Again, though, this doesn’t really suggest that the coronavirus is being overhyped. After all, the same HHS data show how ICU capacity rises and falls — and that, while the pattern largely matches the one above, ICU utilization increases as covid cases increase. ICU capacity correlates to new case totals more strongly than hospitalizations overall.

More covid, more hospitalizations, more ICU beds in use. And then: more deaths. On Monday, we looked at the way in which the same pseudo-Pollyannas downplay the actual death toll for similar reasons: that deaths like those in car accidents are commonly attributed to covid. Except that there have been far more deaths in recent months than historical patterns would suggest, reinforcing the idea that covid has exacted a massive toll.

Throughout this article, I’ve treated the efforts to raise questions about the number of people in the hospital as being offered in good faith. Often they aren’t. Now, as always, the data say precisely what they appear to say: more infections means more hospitalizations means more deaths. Maybe those ratios change with omicron and maybe the shape of the curves change when you extract those individuals who went to the hospital for something other than covid. But there have still been more than 830,000 people who’ve died of covid.

Zenobia Shepherd can’t wrap her mind around her daughter’s death. Her heart won’t let her. Leilani Jordan, who had developmental challenges and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, died in April 2020 of complications from covid-19. She was 27 and working in a Maryland grocery store when she fell ill and days later became one of the first faces of the pandemic’s devastating death toll.

While she continues to grieve her second-oldest child, Shepherd is also on a quest for justice. On Tuesday, she will appear virtually before a Prince George’s Circuit Court judge who is expected to decide whether a lawsuit she and her husband filed last year against Dominion Residence, an assisted-living facility for the developmentally disabled where Jordan lived; the owners of the Giant store where she worked; and a supervisor at the store will move forward.

“There are thousands of stories like Leilani’s, but there are a lot of families that need to be aware that they have rights,” Shepherd said. “They have rights. Sometimes we take it as if we don’t, and there’s nothing we can do. But we have rights.”

Legal experts say Shepherd’s lawsuit is one of a small but likely growing number of cases filed by family members who claim their loved ones contracted the coronavirus and died as a result of an employer’s negligence. Hundreds of workers have filed similar claims blaming their employer after they contracted the virus.

“Leilani was of a vulnerable class, and they were forcing her to actually work without taking care of her and protecting her,” said William C. Johnson III, who is representing Shepherd. “You can’t put profits over people.”

Jordan participated in a program that placed developmentally challenged residents in jobs. At Giant, her mother said, she did whatever she was asked to do, including assembling grocery carts, cleaning the bathroom and locating items for shoppers.

“She just loved being able to help and give back and to, you know, have a purpose,” she said.

Giant and Dominion Residence have asked the judge to dismiss the case, according to court documents. Stephen J. Marshall, an attorney for Giant of Maryland LLC, said his client does not comment on pending litigation. An attorney for Dominion Residence of Maryland did not return a call seeking comment.

Carmel Shachar, the executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, said the question of whether an employer is liable if a worker is exposed to the coronavirus in the workplace is “is still fairly novel because the pandemic is still a fairly new phenomenon.”

“Litigation around covid-19 workplace exposure has been increasing over the last year, and will likely continue to increase with the omicron explosion of cases,” Shachar said in an email.

Diane Hoffmann, the director of the Law and Health Care Program and a professor of health-care law at University of Maryland School of Law, said ordinarily these claims would fall under workers' compensation, which could mean limited recovery.

Johnson is arguing that Jordan was not covered under workers’ compensation.

Unlike some of the other workplace lawsuits stemming from the pandemic, Shepherd’s case is nuanced because of Jordan’s disability and her participation in the work program.

The lawsuit claims negligence and wrongful death and requests that the court issue a judgment for unspecified damages.

The lawsuit charges that Dominion Residence failed to provide a guardian for Jordan, despite a court order requiring one, and that a supervisor at Giant continued to let Jordan work without a guardian. The suit also claims that Dominion did not provide a safe environment for Jordan and failed to provide training on workplace hazards. It also alleges that the Giant supervisor and the store did not require Jordan to wear personal protective equipment.

“She was cleaning the bathroom without gloves and was there without a mask,” Shepherd said, adding that she wants to make employers, nursing homes and assisted-living facilities aware of their responsibilities to those who are vulnerable.

Shachar, speaking generally and not specifically about what happened in Jordan’s case, said employers have a duty to provide a safe, healthy work environment for their employees.

“A really good way to satisfy this requirement would be to provide face coverings or other PPE. If an employer had no or inadequate mitigation efforts in place and an employee got covid-19 from their workplace, you could sue,” she said in an email. “Some of these lawsuits are working their ways through various state courts, although I think it will take some time to fully develop our covid-19 standards for employers (and it will vary based on state, industry and type of role).”

Jordan, whom Shepherd called “Butterfly” for her love of butterflies, told her mom that she was working because “no one else is going to help the senior citizens get their groceries.” Shepherd tried to warn her of the risks of the pandemic, but Jordan continued to work until she could barely breathe.

Jordan began experiencing coronavirus symptoms in March 2020 and was given a “home remedy” by the assisted-living facility, the lawsuit alleges. She was hospitalized after her symptoms worsened. Within hours of being placed on a ventilator, Jordan died in her mother’s arms.

Since Jordan’s death, Shepherd said her younger children, Jeletalora Shepherd, 14, and Zy’on Shepherd, 8, have been in therapy.

They each have had trouble sleeping and problems with eating.

“Zy’on was like [Jordan’s] baby,” Shepherd said. “It has been a nightmare. … I’m just trying to be a mom, that’s all. But I don’t have any good answers for her.”

The United States surpassed its record for covid-19 hospitalizations on Tuesday, with no end in sight to skyrocketing case loads, falling staff levels and the struggles of a medical system trying to provide care amid an unprecedented surge of the coronavirus. Tuesday’s total of 145,982 people in U.S. hospitals with covid-19, which includes 4,462 children, passed the record of 142,273 set on Jan. 14, 2021, during the previous peak of the pandemic in this country.

But the highly transmissible omicron variant threatens to obliterate that benchmark. If models of omicron’s spread prove accurate — even the researchers who produce them admit forecasts are difficult during a pandemic — current numbers may seem small in just a few weeks. Disease modelers are predicting total hospitalizations in the 275,000 to 300,000 range when the peak is reached, probably later this month.

As of Monday, Colorado, Oregon, Louisiana, Maryland and Virginia had declared public health emergencies or authorized crisis standards of care, which allow hospitals and ambulances to restrict treatment when they cannot meet demand.

Nurses and other hospital staff continued to fall sick themselves, raising patient-to-nurse ratios in some places to high levels.

“Our systems and personnel are under extreme strain and I’m not sure how long we can sustain it,” Russell Buhr, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, said in an email.

The omicron variant of the virus still appears to cause less severe illness and fewer deaths, and vaccines and boosters are holding up as bulwarks against both. But the sheer number of cases among unvaccinated people, as well as breakthrough cases, was putting pressure on intensive care units and hospital covid wards anyway, even as fewer people are in the ICU than during last January’s peak. Throughout the pandemic, deaths have also lagged behind jumps in the number of infections by a few weeks. Those numbers may rise as well in days to come.

As of Monday there were 23,524 covid patients in ICUs nationwide, compared with a record 29,591 on Jan. 12, 2021. About 1,200 hospitals — just under a quarter — reported a critical staffing shortage this week, and another 120 reported anticipating a staffing crisis within a week, according to data kept by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The West is experiencing dire shortages, with 29 percent of hospitals experiencing a crisis and 32 expecting one this week. The worst-hit states are Vermont and Rhode Island, where more than 60 percent of the hospitals anticipate staffing crises this week.

In California, 38 percent of hospitals are in crisis, and 43 percent expect a crisis this week. The state Department of Public Health on Sunday began allowing health-care workers with asymptomatic covid cases to return to work immediately without isolating. Those who are exposed and asymptomatic need not test or quarantine.

Under the temporary guidelines, hospitals must first try to bring in contract staff and consider changes to nonessential procedures, and infected staff must wear N95 masks. State officials cited “the critical staffing shortages currently being experienced across the health-care continuum because of the rise in the Omicron variant” in making the change.

Sandy Reding, a nurse and president of the California Nurses Association, said that when the new rules were issued, “I had to read it again.”

“That they would implement such a process is absurd,” she said. “To put an infusion of covid positive employees into that workforce, we’re going to see some devastating impacts.”

Jeremy Faust, an emergency room physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, compiles county-level data that he said shows hospital overcrowding is worse than it appears in some parts of the country. He said the danger of rising ratios of patients to health-care providers is situational.

“A team that is used to carrying 8 patients at once can probably safely expand to ten,” Faust wrote in an email. “But if the complexity of care means that the team is usually capped at 4 or 5 patients, ten could become a challenge and pose new risks.”

Delaware’s largest health system, ChristianaCare, announced Monday that it was activating crisis standards of care. In the days leading up to Christmas, hospital leaders warned they were over capacity, suspending elective surgeries and treating some patients in hallways. In a statement announcing the rationing, the health system said about four in 10 patients across three hospitals are infected with the virus.

“There’s nothing mild about omicron. It’s overrunning our hospital, and it’s outstripping our ability to provide care such that we have to alter our standards,” said Kenneth Silverstein, the system’s chief physician executive, in an interview. “We are seeing sick patients, and we are seeing a lot of them. While the absolute percentage of patients requiring ICU treatment being admitted may be lower, the total number of ICU patients is greater.”

Under Colorado’s crisis standards of care, emergency crews were told to consider not transporting to hospitals patients younger than 60 who are not showing severe symptoms and who do not have a high-risk medical history.

Oregon’s interim crisis guidelines, released Friday, call for hospitals coping with overwhelming patient demand to establish triage teams to score each patient based on likelihood of survival with treatment, rather than age or quality of life.

At University Hospital in Newark, about 61 percent of covid patients did not have coronavirus as their primary diagnosis, meaning that they arrived seeking care for another reason but tested positive when checked for coronavirus.

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, which runs four public hospitals, reported last week that about two-thirds of its 150 covid patients were incidental cases, up from about 20 percent in last winter’s peak.

Overall the daily average of new infections stood at more than 714,600 Monday, according to data tracked by The Washington Post, up 74 percent from a week ago. The daily average of new deaths was 1,674, up 6 percent from a week earlier.

More than 23,000 covid patients were in intensive care, making up just over a third of all intensive care patients, according to the latest HHS report. That’s the highest share of intensive care patients with covid since the peak of the delta surge in September.

Covid patients are staying longer in the hospital than at any time since July 2020, the data show, averaging more than 20 days each. The longer stays indicate that patients are sicker and putting greater stress on the medical system.

Late Sunday, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington predicted that hospitalizations would peak at 273,000 on Jan. 25, with reported infections rising to 1.2 million a day by Jan. 19.

Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious-disease modeler and epidemiologist at Columbia University, predicted that covid hospitalizations may reach 300,000 to 350,000 about Jan. 27.

The United States surpassed its record for covid-19 hospitalizations on Tuesday, with no end in sight to skyrocketing case loads, falling staff levels and the struggles of a medical system trying to provide care amid an unprecedented surge of the coronavirus. Tuesday’s total of 145,982 people in U.S. hospitals with covid-19, which includes 4,462 children, passed the record of 142,273 set on Jan. 14, 2021, during the previous peak of the pandemic in this country.

But the highly transmissible omicron variant threatens to obliterate that benchmark. If models of omicron’s spread prove accurate — even the researchers who produce them admit forecasts are difficult during a pandemic — current numbers may seem small in just a few weeks. Disease modelers are predicting total hospitalizations in the 275,000 to 300,000 range when the peak is reached, probably later this month.

As of Monday, Colorado, Oregon, Louisiana, Maryland and Virginia had declared public health emergencies or authorized crisis standards of care, which allow hospitals and ambulances to restrict treatment when they cannot meet demand.

Nurses and other hospital staff continued to fall sick themselves, raising patient-to-nurse ratios in some places to high levels.

The reports from coronavirus patients are disconcerting. Only a few hours before, they were enjoying a cup of pungent coffee or the fragrance of flowers in a garden. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, those smells disappeared. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Young and old alike are affected — more than 80 to 90 percent of those diagnosed with the virus, according to some estimates. While most people recover in a few months, 16 percent take half a year or longer to do so, research has found. According to new estimates, up to 1.6 million Americans have chronic smell problems because of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Seniors are especially vulnerable, experts say. “We know that many older adults have a compromised sense of smell to begin with. Add to that the insult of covid, and it made these problems worse,” said Jayant Pinto, a professor of surgery and a specialist in sinus and nasal diseases at the University of Chicago Medical Center.

Recent data highlights the interaction between covid-19, advanced age and loss of smell. When Italian researchers evaluated 101 patients who had been hospitalized for mild to moderate covid-19, 50 showed objective signs of smell impairment six months later. Those 65 or older were nearly twice as likely to be impaired; those 75 or older were more than 2½ times as likely.

Most people aren’t aware of the extent to which smell can be diminished in later life. More than half of 65-to-80-year-olds have some degree of smell loss, or olfactory dysfunction, as it’s known in the scientific literature. That rises to as high as 80 percent for those even older. People affected often report concerns about safety, less enjoyment eating and an impaired quality of life.

But because the ability to detect, identify and discriminate among odors declines gradually, most older adults — up to 75 percent of those with some degree of smell loss — don’t realize they’re affected.

A host of factors are believed to contribute to age-related smell loss, including a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons in the nose, which are essential for detecting odors; changes in stem cells that replenish these neurons every few months; atrophy of the processing center for smell in the brain, called the olfactory bulb; and the shrinkage of brain centers closely connected with the olfactory bulb, such as the hippocampus, a region central to learning and memory.

Also, environmental toxic substances such as air pollution play a part, research shows. “Olfactory neurons in your nose are basically little pieces of your brain hanging out in the outside world,” and exposure to them over time damages those neurons and the tissues that support them, said Pamela Dalton, a principal investigator at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a smell and taste research institute in Philadelphia.

Still, the complex workings of the olfactory system have not been mapped in detail yet, and much remains unknown, said Sandeep Robert Datta, a professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.

“We tend to think of our sense of smell as primarily aesthetic,” he said. “What’s very clear is that it’s far more important. The olfactory system plays a key role in maintaining our emotional well-being and connecting us with the world.”

Datta experienced this after having a bone-marrow transplant followed by chemotherapy years ago. Unable to smell or taste food, he said, he felt “very disoriented” in his environment.

Common consequences of smell loss include a loss of appetite (without smell, taste is deeply compromised), difficulty monitoring personal hygiene, depression and an inability to detect noxious fumes. In older adults, this can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, frailty, inadequate personal care, and accidents caused by gas leaks or fires.

Jerome Pisano, 75, of Bloomington, Ill., has been living with smell loss for five years. Repeated tests and consultations with physicians haven’t pinpointed a reason for this ailment, and sometimes he feels “hopeless,” Pisano admitted.

Before he became smell-impaired, Pisano was certified as a wine specialist. He has an 800-bottle wine cellar. “I can’t appreciate that as much as I’d like. I miss the smell of cut grass. Flowers. My wife’s cooking,” he said. “It certainly does decrease my quality of life.”

Smell loss is also associated in various research studies with a higher risk of death for older adults. One study, by Pinto and colleagues, found that older adults with olfactory dysfunction were nearly three times as likely to die over a period of five years as seniors whose sense of smell remained intact.

“Our sense of smell signals how our nervous system is doing and how well our brain is doing overall,” Pinto said. According to a review published earlier this year, 90 percent of people with early-stage Parkinson’s disease and more than 80 percent of people with Alzheimer’s disease have olfactory dysfunction — a symptom that can precede other symptoms by many years.

There is no treatment for smell loss associated with neurological illness or head trauma, but if someone has persistent sinus problems or allergies that cause congestion, an over-the-counter antihistamine or nasal steroid spray can help. Usually, smell returns in a few weeks.

For smell loss following a viral infection, the picture is less clear. It’s not known, yet, which viruses are associated with olfactory dysfunction, why they damage smell and what trajectory recovery takes. Covid-19 may help shine a light on this since it has inspired a wave of research on olfaction loss around the world.

“What characteristics make people more vulnerable to a persistent loss of smell after a virus? We don’t know that, but I think we will because that research is underway and we’ve never had a cohort [of people with smell loss] this large to study,” Dalton said.

Some experts recommend smell training, noting evidence of efficacy and no indication of harm. This involves sniffing four distinct scents (often eucalyptus, lemon, rose and cloves) twice a day for 30 seconds each, usually for four weeks. Sometimes the practice is combined with pictures of the items being smelled, a form of visual reinforcement.

The theory is that “practice, practice, practice” will stimulate the olfactory system, said Charles Greer, a professor of neurosurgery and neuroscience at Yale School of Medicine. Although scientific support isn’t well established, he said, he often recommends that people who think their smell is declining “get a shelf full of spices and smell them on a regular basis.”

Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Smell and Taste Center, remains skeptical. He’s writing a review of smell training and notes that 20 to 30 percent of people with viral infections and smell loss recover in a relatively short time, whether they pursue this therapy.

“The main thing we recommend is avoid polluted environments and get your full complement of vitamins,” since several vitamins play an important role in maintaining the olfactory system, he said.

The federal government has resumed shipping all three monoclonal antibody treatments authorized for early-stage covid-19 to states despite evidence that two might be ineffective against the omicron variant of the coronavirus that is sweeping the country. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The move has drawn mixed reactions from physicians and experts. Some are concerned many of the costly infusions will be useless, causing confusion among patients who have heard glowing reports about the treatments. They note that it can be difficult for doctors to determine whether their patients are infected with omicron or the previously dominant delta variant, making treatment decisions tricky.

But other physicians remain eager to receive even less-effective treatments because of a severe shortage of sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody therapy that, according to laboratory tests, works best against omicron. They say they would rather have access to some monoclonal antibodies than none, partly because some of their patients may be infected by the delta variant.

Advertisement

That raises difficult questions. “Is it ethical and practical to give those treatments to people who you think almost certainly have omicron?” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Most patients are demanding something.”

She said the current situation is “a transition period,” as omicron overtakes delta. “But it is very murky, very confusing to patients.”

David Kessler, the chief scientific officer for the administration’s covid response, said the government has been responding to requests from state and local health officials in making all three monoclonal antibodies available. But the administration has made clear that the two that don’t work against the omicron variant should be used ""only if the delta variant represents a significant proportion of infections in the region and then only with the explicit understanding that these treatments would be ineffective if the patients are infected with the omicron variant.”

The bottom line, he said, is “don’t use [those treatments] unless you have the testing that shows that a patient does not have omicron.” He added that the administration this week will re-evaluate whether it should continue making all three antibody treatments available considering omicron’s overwhelming dominance.

After the omicron variant emerged around Thanksgiving, the Department of Health and Human Services briefly halted shipments of sotrovimab, made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology to stockpile it for the time when omicron became more prevalent. Shipments resumed weeks after that, as omicron became increasingly rampant.

On Dec. 23, the department announced it would pause shipments of two other monoclonal antibody treatments, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly, which laboratory tests have shown are less effective against the new variant.

Last week, the administration resumed shipments of those two medications. The latest reversal followed complaints from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and some doctors that the Regeneron treatments could help in places where the delta variant of the virus is still infecting people. DeSantis also said he was not convinced the Regeneron and Lilly cocktails were ineffective against the omicron variant.

Those two treatments were used heavily last year to prevent hospitalizations of people infected by the delta variant, but have proven less effective against omicron in lab tests. (An injectable monoclonal antibody, AstraZeneca’s Evusheld, was approved last month for pre-exposure use in immunocompromised people; the company said lab studies show it “retained neutralizing activity” against omicron.) New antiviral pills also are expected to be effective against both the delta and omicron variants.

The Regeneron and Lilly medications, given to outpatients by infusion or injection, are free and have caused few side effects. They are authorized for anyone with mild to moderate disease who doesn’t need supplemental oxygen. They also can be given prophylactically to high-risk patients, including people 65 and older, who have been exposed to the virus.

Some monoclonal antibody treatments are effective and free to high-risk coronavirus patients, but experts say the treatment alone cannot prevent the next surge. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)

The Biden administration agreed Dec. 31 to start shipping the Regeneron and Lilly products last week. In a news release Tuesday, DeSantis, one of the most vocal proponents of monoclonal antibody treatments, took credit for forcing the administration to change course. He said the state would soon receive an additional 30,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies.

In an email, DeSantis’s spokeswoman, Christina Pushaw, asserted that “there have been Omicron cases treated with other [monoclonal antibodies] that showed significant improvement, contrary to the initial study that came out and apparently informed the now-reversed HHS policy.”

A spokeswoman for HHS’s assistant secretary of preparedness and response, who is in charge of distributing the monoclonal antibodies, referred a reporter to updates on the agency’s website that announced the change of strategy.

The latest update attributed the change of heart to a recommendation from a panel at the National Institutes of Health, which concluded that “if the Delta [variant of concern] still represents a significant proportion of infections in the region and other options are not available or are contraindicated, patients can be offered” the other two monoclonal antibody treatments.

But experts worry that patients and doctors will be flummoxed by the advice they must digest about different monoclonal antibody treatments. In the vast majority of cases, they noted, physicians making treatment decisions do not know whether their patient is infected by the omicron or delta variants, because little genomic sequencing is being done. Even when tests are sequenced, the results are usually too late to be considered in treatment deliberations.

If omicron now accounts for 95 percent of all new U.S. cases, as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday, the newly reauthorized therapies will have little effect.

“When delta and omicron were 50-50, fighting it out, I was very enthusiastic about continuing to use the Regeneron and Lilly monoclonals as long as there was a way of differentiating between the two,” said John W. Mellors, chief of infectious diseases at UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. “The dilemma was there wasn’t a rapid FDA-approved test to differentiate omicron from delta. And the reality is sequencing takes several days.”

Advertisement

Now, he said, “if I had local data that was reliable, that was broad enough that suggested delta is still prominent, yes I might give the antibody. But I’d want real time data on what people are becoming infected with.”

Most hospitals do not have the capability to do real-time sequencing to determine how to treat individual patients, Marrazzo said. She said her medical center’s laboratory regularly sequences batches of patient samples to determine the prevalence of each variant.

Marrazzo said the last time her hospital lab performed sequencing to determine the prevalence of the variants, on Dec. 22, the results showed almost 60 percent of new cases were caused by omicron and the rest by delta. But now, state data is showing that omicron is responsible for 99.8 percent of new cases in Alabama.

Marrazzo said the medical center on Tuesday received its first shipment of sotrovimab — 16 courses that already are gone. She said physicians were using the Regeneron and Lilly treatments as backup, but now will halt those because of the overwhelming dominance of omicron. She expects more sotrovimab next week.

Nicole Iovine, an infectious-disease physician and chief epidemiologist for University of Florida Health in Gainesville, said in some areas of the country, especially parts of the west and Midwest, the delta variant still accounts for a portion of covid-19 infections.

“In certain parts of the country, Regeneron is still likely to have an effect,” she said.

A CDC map of omicron’s spread shows it accounts for at least 77.4 percent of sequenced infections in each of 10 regions, with most at greater than 90 percent.

“How long do the symptoms of the omicron variant of covid-19 last?” — Donna in California Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Symptoms from omicron or any other version of the virus vary from one person to the next. Vaccination status, health history, age and lifestyle could all play a role in the duration and severity of illness.

Getting the vaccines and booster shots is the best way to reduce your risk of severe and potentially long-lasting disease. It’s clear from a growing body of research that healthy, boosted people are unlikely to get seriously sick or wind up in the hospital. Those who have received the initial vaccine shots, without boosters, appear to be protected against severe illness, too. Unvaccinated people and those with underlying health conditions face much higher risk of severe covid-19, hospitalization and death.

The emerging picture of omicron suggests that it may be less likely to result in hospitalization compared with the delta variant. Some early data indicates that covid-19 from omicron infections may be less severe, presenting more like a common cold or flu for some patients. Whether that means symptoms actually resolve faster remains to be seen — omicron has only been with us for about a month, so the findings are still scattered.

One eye-opening study out of Norway looked at an omicron outbreak at a Nov. 30 holiday party where 66 people of 117 fully vaccinated attendees tested positive for the virus and 15 had probable cases. Health authorities investigating the outbreak found that cough, nasal congestion, fatigue and sore throat were the most common symptoms, followed by headache and fever. More than a dozen of those infected said their symptoms cleared in a couple of days, while 62 attendees said they were still experiencing some symptoms around the one-week mark. None of the cases required hospitalization as of Dec. 13, two weeks after the party, researchers found.

People with mild covid-19 — of whatever strain — tend to bounce back in a week or two, according to Johns Hopkins. Research shows they probably aren’t at risk of spreading the virus to others 10 days after the onset of symptoms, provided that their symptoms have improved in that time and they aren’t feverish. Severe cases, on the other hand, can stretch for more than a month and leave people contagious for longer. There also is the vexing problem of “long covid,” which can cause some symptoms to linger for many months, even in vaccinated people.

Some coronavirus symptoms may also last longer than others, said Joshua Septimus, a medical director in the Houston Methodist health-care system. “In particular, fatigue and loss of taste and smell can persist beyond the period of contagion,” Septimus wrote recently.

A Twitter account with more than a million followers that’s famous for helping consumers track down elusive PlayStation 5 consoles is helping the fight against covid-19 by pointing the public to hard-to-find home tests and available vaccination appointments. Earlier this week, the account, @Wario64, posted on the availability of the BinaxNOW antigen self test, including links to purchase the kits from Amazon. The latest posts come as a spike in covid-19 cases from the omicron variant has led to massive demand for the home tests, with the government and U.S. Postal Service finalizing plans to alleviate that rush by sending coronavirus test kits to U.S. households.

The Wario64 Twitter account started in 2009 and has become renowned for quickly finding availability of great deals on video games and gaming-related paraphernalia like accessories and books. Its name is a play on the groundbreaking 1996 Nintendo game “Super Mario 64” and the plumber mascot’s bizarro twin nemesis, Wario. The account also sometimes acts as a news account but has been most useful in recent years in finding online availability of ravenously desired and hard-to-find gaming products. Both the New York Times and The Washington Post cited Wario64 as a go-to utility for hunting down PlayStation 5 consoles, which remain scarce for consumers more than a year after launch. The account’s speed and reliability in finding these deals has made it a stalwart Twitter service.

For the past year or so, the account has also been flexing its muscle to help followers find vaccination appointments and, now, hard-to-find tests. It started shortly after satirical gaming news site Hard Drive published an April 2021 piece titled “U.S. Government Reaches Agreement with Wario64 to Announce Covid Vaccine Availability.” Just days later, Wario64 tweeted about vaccination appointment availability in San Antonio.

The identity of the account has been kept secret for more than a decade. When contacted by The Post on Thursday, a person who runs the Wario64 account declined to be interviewed on the record, citing a policy that they don’t do media interviews.

The account’s pivot to fight the pandemic underscores the difficulty of securing vaccine doses and coronavirus tests. The federal government has come under criticism for its response to averting a coronavirus testing shortfall and getting rapid tests out to the public. Just weeks before President Biden announced a plan to distribute 500 million tests sometime this month, a plan on which he has yet to elaborate, White House press secretary Jen Psaki mocked a journalist’s question about whether the government should give out tests free, even as other countries distribute tests for their citizens. Tuesday, White House officials said they were finalizing purchasing these tests.

That same day, Biden tweeted an acknowledgment that getting tested remains a frustrating process, and then suggested Americans search “covid test near me” on Google. Biden’s “just Google it” suggestion aligns with White House’s plan to work with the tech giant to streamline search results for anyone looking for tests.

I know COVID testing remains frustrating, but we are making improvements.



In the last two weeks we have stood up federal testing sites all over this country — and we are adding more each day.



Google “COVID test near me” to find the nearest site where you can get a test. — President Biden (@POTUS) January 5, 2022

Gaming news site Kotaku praised the help of Wario64 on Thursday with a headline that called the account “a better lead on covid tests than the government.”

As Americans continue to seek out coronavirus aid on their own, they’ll at least have the help of an acclaimed video game Twitter account. And maybe they’ll score a PlayStation 5 in the process if they’re lucky.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo, the world’s largest video game conference more commonly known as E3, will no longer be held in person in 2022, according to the Entertainment Software Administration (ESA), the event’s organizer. The decision comes as coronavirus cases continue to spike across the United States due to the virus’s omicron variant.

“Due to the ongoing health risks surrounding covid-19 and its potential impact on the safety of exhibitors and attendees, E3 will not be held in person in 2022,” the ESA said in a statement to The Washington Post Thursday. “We are nonetheless excited about the future of E3 and look forward to announcing more details soon.”

From 2009 until 2019, E3 had been held annually in June at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The onset of the covid-19 pandemic canceled the event outright in 2020 and forced it to evolve into a four-day series of online presentations in 2021. The 2021 conference opened with an announcement that the conference would return to an in-person format in 2022. The persistence of coronavirus cases appears to have changed that plan.

Reached by The Post, the ESA declined to comment beyond the statement.

E3 is traditionally viewed as the main event in the video game industry’s collection of yearly conferences and expositions. Developers and publishers from around the globe converge on downtown Los Angeles, welcoming media and gamers to demo new and upcoming releases. A series of unrelated events have eroded its stature somewhat in recent years, notably Sony Interactive Entertainment’s 2019 decision to opt out of the yearly expo and instead hold their own virtual presentations for its PlayStation line.

The move to cancel E3′s in-person event some five months before the conference comes just as the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) wraps up in Las Vegas amid fears of the surge in coronavirus cases related to the omicron variant.

Other major gaming industry and tech conferences, such as the DICE Summit (Feb. 22-24 in Las Vegas), Game Developers Conference (March 21-25 in San Francisco) and South By Southwest (March 11-20 in Austin) remained scheduled for in-person events at the time of the ESA’s announcement.

It feels a bit like deja vu at the late-night shows. The same week Seth Meyers announced he tested positive for the coronavirus, Jimmy Fallon designated a segment of “The Tonight Show” to discussing his own experience with covid-19. Fallon tested positive during his holiday break last month when he swung by the NBC headquarters in New York to film a bit for “Saturday Night Live.” He said on Monday’s show that he was briefly quarantined in an office before being sent home to isolate.

On Thursday, CBS’s “Late Late Show” host James Corden posted a message to social media saying he tested positive as well. “I’m fully vaccinated, boosted and because of this am fortunate enough to say I feel completely fine,” he wrote. “The show will be off the air for the next few days. Stay safe everyone.”

Fallon’s recollection of the events surrounding his positive test recalled some of the behind-the-scenes scrambling that took place in March 2020, when the producers of live television programs were forced to quickly figure out how to adapt to the onset of the pandemic. But, aside from the fact that Fallon’s show was on hiatus, there is a major difference this time around: the availability of coronavirus vaccines, as the host underscored on air.

“I want to tell everyone, please, out there — get vaxxed,” he said. “If you can, get vaxxed, get boosted. Man. This thing, it’s a banger. It’s a real thing. If I didn’t have that, it felt like I would be real, real, real, real, real sick.”

Fallon’s two young daughters also tested positive, and the family spent the holidays quarantining together.

Meyers shared his covid-19 diagnosis Tuesday morning on Twitter: “The bad news is, I tested positive for COVID (thanks, 2022!) the good news is, I feel fine (thanks vaccines and booster!) We are canceling the rest of the shows this week, so tune in next Monday to see what cool location we will try and pass off as a studio!!!""

“Late Night with Seth Meyers” producers were unavailable to discuss how they plan to move forward next week, though Meyers’s tweet suggests remote production. Fallon returned to the studio after his holiday break.

Both “The Tonight Show” and “Late Night” are filmed at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, also home to SNL. The episode set to air the day Fallon tested positive was majorly disrupted by “the recent spike in the Omicron variant,” as the sketch comedy series’ Twitter account stated that afternoon. Musical guest Charli XCX said she was unable to perform because of coronavirus precautions, and the show was largely composed of pretaped and archival sketches. Host Paul Rudd appeared in a mostly empty studio alongside fellow five-time SNL hosts and special guests Tom Hanks and Tina Fey.

“Thank you for joining me,” Hanks said during the episode. “As you know, I started the five-timers club.”

Fey responded, “Oh, like you started covid!”

Facebook suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for one day for spreading misinformation about covid-19, a day after Twitter permanently suspended her personal account for repeatedly violating the company’s policy. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Facebook said Greene’s post “goes against our standards on misinformation that can cause physical harm” and barred her from posting or commenting for 24 hours. Greene included the Facebook post in her criticism of Monday’s punishment.

Greene recently published a tweet falsely suggesting “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths.” Included was a chart featuring data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which details self-reported post-vaccine health issues that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns do not imply causation.

The congresswoman, who has been repeatedly criticized for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic to her thousands of social media followers, lashed out at the two platforms in another forum.

“Who appointed Twitter and Facebook to be the authorities of information and misinformation,” she asked on Gettr, a conservative social media platform launched by Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign. “When Big Tech decides what political speech of elected Members is accepted and what’s not then they are working against our government and against the interest of our people.”

Greene argued that her suspension is problematic because she represents more than 700,000 “US tax paying citizens.”

“I’m an elected Member of Congress representing over 700,000 US tax paying citizens and I represent their voices, values, defend their freedoms, and protect the Constitution,” the Republican lawmaker wrote.

In response to Greene’s tweets, Aaron Simpson, a spokesman for Meta, which owns Facebook, told The Washington Post, “A post violated our policies and we have removed it; but removing her account for this violation is beyond the scope of our policies.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) issued a statement claiming that opinions like Greene’s are under assault by major social media companies, which he says “have amassed more power and more control over more speech than any other institution in history.”

“Diversity of opinion is the lifeblood of our democracy,” McCarthy wrote. “And yet that fundamental American value is under assault by Big Tech. … Their recent decisions to silence Americans — including a sitting member of Congress and renowned physicians — who share views different from the political and media elite have real world costs.”

It was unclear what “renowned physicians” McCarthy was referring to. Health authorities have repeatedly emphasized that the vaccines, launched during the Trump administration, are safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that more than 496 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered between December 2020 and December 2021. In that period, VAERS received 10,688 reports of death among people who had received the shots — or 0.0022 percent — though the fatalities were not necessarily tied to immunization.

Greene’s verified personal account was temporarily suspended twice during the summer of 2021. In July, she falsely claimed that the coronavirus was “not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65,” causing her to lose access for 12 hours. And in August, she was suspended for a week after falsely tweeting that the coronavirus vaccines were “failing.”

Congressional leaders in both parties condemned Greene last spring for comparing face-mask policies to the Nazi practice of requiring Jews to wear Star of David badges. She apologized but has continued to attack coronavirus policies, refuse to wear a mask on the House floor and share false information about the virus. She has amassed thousands of dollars in fines for violating the House policy on masks.

Twitter has permanently suspended the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), saying Sunday that the congresswoman repeatedly violated the company’s covid-19 misinformation policy. The suspension came hours after she published a tweet falsely suggesting “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths.” Included was a chart featuring data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which details self-reported post-vaccine health issues that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns do not imply causation.

The congresswoman’s verified personal account had been temporarily suspended two times over the summer. In July, she lost access for 12 hours after falsely claiming that the coronavirus was “not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65.” A month later, she faced a week-long suspension after falsely tweeting that the coronavirus vaccines were “failing.”

Twitter on Sunday cited a “strike” system for violations of its covid policy, which bars users from sharing content that is “demonstrably false or misleading and may lead to significant risk of harm.” Five or more strikes lead to a permanent suspension.

“We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” Katie Rosborough, a company spokeswoman, said in an email to The Washington Post.

Responding via a statement on the messaging app Telegram, Greene lambasted Twitter, saying it “is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth. That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them.” She shared the message through other social media outlets where she has a presence, including Gettr, a conservative-friendly site led by former Donald Trump adviser Jason Miller.

On Twitter, Greene maintains access to her congressional account, @RepMTG, as it is not in violation of company policies, Rosborough confirmed. The congresswoman’s most recent tweet from that account was a Dec. 24 video wishing her followers a merry Christmas.

Twitter has rules intended to limit the spread of misinformation on the site. Under those rules, misleading claims that could cause significant confusion or harm are subject to removal, labels or other actions.

Last year, the company permanently banned President Donald Trump, days after a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The social media site had long resisted action against his posts, arguing that a world leader should be able to communicate with the public. But after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Twitter said the risk of further violence compelled it to act.

Greene’s rise has been marked by extreme rhetoric online and off, as well as support for QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory positing that Trump is working to take down a cabal of “deep state” saboteurs who traffic children for sex. She was elected in 2020 by voters in Georgia’s reliably conservative 14th Congressional District, in an ascent that worried some GOP officials.

Congressional leaders in both parties condemned her last spring for comparing face-mask policies to the Nazi practice of requiring Jews to wear Star of David badges. She apologized but has continued to attack coronavirus policies, refuse to wear a mask on the House floor and share false information about the virus.

Her personal Twitter account, @mtgreenee, faced escalating penalties in recent months as she ran afoul of the misinformation policy. The post that led to her permanent suspension was part of a Saturday thread comparing American life “Before Covid” and “After Covid” and blasting measures aimed at reducing the coronavirus’s spread, including testing, mask-wearing and vaccine mandates.

The tweet at issue claimed coronavirus vaccine deaths were being “ignored,” citing the VAERS data. But the database itself warns that the information can be incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental or unverifiable, saying that the “reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.”

Health authorities have repeatedly emphasized that the vaccines are safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 496 million doses of vaccines have been administered between December 2020 and December 2021. In that time frame, VAERS received 10,688 reports of death among people who had received the shots — or 0.0022 percent — though those fatalities were not necessarily tied to immunization. Health-care providers are required to report any death after a covid vaccination to the system, even if it’s not clear whether the shots were the cause.

The agency last month recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots over those made by Johnson & Johnson, citing concerns about the increased risk of a rare but potentially fatal blood clot issue. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the move demonstrated the agency’s “commitment to provide real-time scientific information to the American public.”

Current guidance from the CDC describes the vaccines as “much safer than getting covid-19,” developed under intense safety monitoring and effective at preventing severe illness.
