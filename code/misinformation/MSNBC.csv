2021-02-27 23:27:47+00:00,200,"The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, adding a third vaccine to the U.S. arsenal to fight the pandemic.

“Today’s emergency use authorization of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is another milestone as we work to end the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Guided by our careful review of the science and data, we have determined that the vaccine’s known potential benefits clearly outweigh its known potential risks.”

The decision comes one day after an advisory committee to the FDA voted unanimously in favor of recommending the vaccine.

""We're in a race between the virus mutating, with new variants coming out that can cause further disease, and stopping it,"" said Dr. Jay Portnoy, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine and a member of the advisory committee.

""The fewer people who are infected with the virus, the less opportunity it has to emerge as a more virulent strain.""

President Joe Biden released a statement after the announcement, calling the decision ""exciting news for all Americans, and an encouraging development in our efforts to bring an end to the crisis.""

Doses are expected to begin shipping Monday, starting with about 4 million of them. Johnson & Johnson, which developed the vaccine in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said that 20 million doses will be available by the end of March.

That will be enough to fully vaccinate 20 million people, because the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given as a single dose. The other available vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are given as two doses each, three to four weeks apart.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be given as a single dose, the company is studying the impact of a second dose.

On Friday, members of the FDA's panel of independent experts wondered what would happen if a two-dose formulation is ultimately authorized.

Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, suggested it might be difficult to communicate the change to those who only received the one dose.

""You can see where that would be confusing to people where they may be thinking, 'Maybe I didn’t get what I need?'""

An FDA analysis, posted online Wednesday, found the vaccine to be safe and effective. The single shot was shown to be 86 percent effective at preventing severe disease. In the U.S., the shot was found to be 72 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe disease. In South Africa, where a worrisome variant is circulating, that number was lower: 64 percent.

""People should take the vaccine they are able to access,"" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. ""All these vaccines meet our standards for effectiveness.""

Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, applauded the FDA's decision.

""With three Covid-19 vaccines now available, the number of cases and deaths around the country continuing to fall, and Congress taking steps toward approving additional critically needed economic relief, I have never been more encouraged that we might be finally turning the corner on this pandemic,"" he said in a statement.

Still, Besser said that Americans must remain vigilant, adhering to mask-wearing, distancing and limiting travel. ""Whether and when the pandemic ends is — as it has always been — largely up to us.”

In December, the FDA authorized Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Two more vaccines, from AstraZeneca and Novavax, are completing Phase 3 clinical trials, and are expected to apply for FDA authorization in the spring.

2021-02-27 20:04:04+00:00,89,"There may be no creature on this planet more stubborn than a Republican member of Congress. President Joe Biden's Covid-19 stimulus package is chugging along, with Democrats in the both the House and the Senate committed to its passage. And yet as a whole, the GOP caucus is still digging in its heels. But its reluctance reflects a partisan commitment to obstruction, not what Americans want.

As it stands, time isn't on Republicans' side as they desperately try to derail things. Democrats hope to get the bill to Biden's desk before March 14, when some unemployment benefits are set to expire. The House is set to vote on the $1.9 trillion package as soon as Friday after weeks of shepherding the behemoth through various committees. But the bill will face a tougher challenge in the Senate, where changes will definitely be made. (Case in point: The Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday that the $15-an-hour minimum wage hike can't stay in the bill.) That leaves little time for delay, despite grumbling from some Republicans that Biden didn't give them enough time to haggle.

But whether Republicans like it or not (and they don't) the bill as it stands is the only game in town right now. In response, they are pretty transparent about their efforts to obstruct like the dickens in the hope that they can turn around and blame Democrats for not getting anything done for Americans in the 2022 midterm elections. In effect, they're running the same play that they used effectively at the beginning of the Great Recession over a decade ago. But 2021 isn't 2009, and it's truly wild that Republicans can't see that yet.

In early February 2009, Gallup polls showed that about 52 percent of Americans were in favor of the $800 billion proposal that would eventually become the American Recovery and Relief Act. Only 24 percent of Republicans surveyed in the poll, taken soon after the deal passed in the House, supported the measure. If anything, it seemed like President Barack Obama's personal approval rating was buoying support for the bill overall.

And even though over two-thirds of Americans thought more money would need to be spent to stimulate the economy, the final bill was smaller than originally planned thanks to GOP criticism. This set Democrats up to fail, making the bill less effective and ultimately less popular. In other words, Republican opposition made some horrible degree of sense — a reality validated by GOP gains in the 2012 midterms.

Fast-forward to today and you'll find a vastly different situation. Given the political division in this country, Biden's proposal is almost absurdly popular, with sizable majorities backing it in recent polls. What's really amazing, though, is that the bill is only growing in popularity — including among Republican voters.

A poll by Quinnipiac University taken in the last week of January found that 68 percent of respondents were on board with Biden's plan, including about 37 percent of Republicans. A New York Times/SurveyMonkey poll taken the next week bumped that approval up to 72 percent of respondents and 43 percent of Republicans surveyed. But most eye-popping was this week's news that a new Morning Consult/Politico survey found that 60 percent of Republicans asked were at least somewhat supportive of the $1.9 trillion package. Overall, 76 percent of the respondents in that poll wanted the bill signed into law.

What's really amazing, though, is that the bill is only growing in popularity — including among Republican voters.

If that wasn't enough, you know who else loves this bill? Businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in favor of Biden's proposal early. Then, on Wednesday, more than 150 top business leaders signed a letter encouraging Congress to pass the bill posthaste. That included executives from ""AT&T, Blackstone, Comcast (the parent company of NBCUniversal), Corcoran, Goldman Sachs, Google, Saks Fifth Avenue, Siemens, T-Mobile and United Airlines,"" so, uh, not exactly a small segment of the economy.

Even elected Republicans back this bill, as long as they aren't coastal elites who spend their days in Washington, D.C. Out in the real heartland — places like Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma — mayors of cities in need of help are throwing their support behind Biden's stimulus efforts. As Mayor Bryan Barnett of Rochester Hills, Michigan, told USA Today, his constituents aren't interested in ""the games being played in Washington."" (And I've been to Rochester Hills, Michigan; it's not exactly a bastion of liberalism.)

Biden, to his credit, has done his best to get Republicans to see the writing on the wall. ""My hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents,"" he said during a Pfizer vaccine facility tour on Feb. 19. White House press secretary Jen Psaki wasn't joking when she told reporters Jan. 29 that despite the bill's moving forward in a way that won't require GOP defectors to pass in the Senate, ""Republicans can still vote for a package even if it goes through reconciliation.""

And yet, when the package passed out of the House Budget committee on Monday, it was on a party-line vote, with all 16 Republican members voting nay. The same day that Biden was asking Republicans to listen to their voters, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., sent out a message to his caucus urging a no vote.

Scalise's ""whip notice"" referred to the bill as the ""Pelosi's Payoff to Progressives Act,"" the latest in what has become an increasingly desperate messaging campaign. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., tried a similar tactic on Twitter on Wednesday, attempting to point out wasteful items hidden in the bill. But as far as dunks go, this was less a backboard breaker and more of a ""get the ball stuck behind the rim"" situation.

Now, there's still a chance that Republicans' cynical gamble will pay off for them politically. By fall 2010, just ahead of the midterms, the GOP's anti-Obama mantra had sunk in with voters — more than two-thirds of Americans thought the 2009 stimulus bill was ""a waste"" by then. But Democrats may have learned their lesson: Go big or go home. They aren't budging on the size and scope of the bill, making it less likely that its effects are forgotten quickly.

All this means that I, for one, am looking forward to the midterm commercials in 2022, when Republican members of the House are touting the benefits of the package while bending over backward to avoid citing where the funding came from. But we'll know. And we'll remember how hard they worked to block it.",MSNBC,"['bill', 'republican', 'poll', 'popular', 'democrats', 'package', 'house', 'senate', 'needs', 'plan', 'bidens', 'accept', 'republicans', 'stimulus', 'americans', 'gop']",0

2021-02-27 16:33:04+00:00,138,"WASHINGTON — In a bid to align his unity pitch with his pursuit of a bold agenda, President Joe Biden has been selling his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 package as bipartisan.

But that message crashed into a hard reality early Saturday morning when the House passed the bill — without a single Republican vote.

In recent weeks, Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain has marshaled the White House messaging apparatus to make the case that the president's aid package is bipartisan, not because any GOP lawmakers have signed on, but because polls show it has support from a large majority of the public, and because some Republican mayors and officials outside Washington have backed it.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where it also lacks GOP support.

Klain has repeatedly cited polls in the face of criticism for pursuing a party-line approach.

More evidence: the American Rescue Plan IS a bipartisan plan -- one that unifies this country! https://t.co/wslD0ITPWW — Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) February 9, 2021

White House digital director Rob Flaherty said Wednesday that the Covid plan is “extremely bipartisan,” citing a Morning Consult poll that showed 76 percent public support, including 60 percent of self-identified Republicans.

While Democrats can pass it without Republicans if they stick together, the dynamic points to a bigger struggle for Biden: The GOP “epiphany” he predicted shows no sign of materializing, and his agenda is likely to face the kind of full-fledged partisan opposition that bedeviled Barack Obama as president.

Asked at a recent CNN town hall how he will heal a divided nation, Biden cited polls that find significant support among Republican voters for his Covid-19 plan. He said they show the U.S. is “not nearly as divided as we make it out to be.”

But those pleas haven't moved Republican lawmakers. His task is complicated by the fact that large numbers of Republican voters falsely say he lost the 2020 election and, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll, want their leaders to stand up to him rather than cut deals.

“That's kind of an interesting approach to it,” former Senate Republican budget staffer Bill Hoagland said. “What they're saying is the Republicans that are here do not represent their constituents back home and therefore we should listen to the constituents.”

Hoagland, now at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said bipartisanship in Washington has historically meant winning votes from the other party. He said he has never seen it defined by polls during his 25 years working on Capitol Hill, calling Biden’s version “an interesting twist on the legislative and democratic process.”

But many progressives like the new approach, including those who were critical of Biden’s talk of unity.

“I think it’s super smart,"" said Adam Jentleson, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. ""If you let Mitch McConnell define what is bipartisan, nothing ever will be. Defining it based on public opinion is accurate and opens the door to doing big things,”

'You Can't Have It Both Ways'

The frustration has extended to Republicans on Capitol Hill who hoped that Biden would cut down his $1.9 trillion package to win their support, but those talks dissolved after Biden decided their $618 billion plan was too small to address the crisis.

“No matter how many times they tweet about it, unelected White House staffers can’t singlehandedly change the definition of ‘unity.’ At some point, just have the courage to admit what you’re doing: pushing a partisan bill through a partisan process,” said a Republican aide familiar with the bipartisan Covid-19 relief talks. “You can’t have it both ways.”

Matt Gorman, a GOP consultant and campaign operative, called Biden’s approach “too clever by half.”

As a candidate, Biden often waxed nostalgic about cross-party cooperation during his time in the Senate and said he'd be a president who works to revive that spirit. His tenure dates to the 1970s and 1980s, an era when the two parties each had a broad mix of liberals and conservatives in their ranks, which paved the way for bipartisan coalitions. That isn't the case today.

""President Biden promised unity, but Democrats are delivering one-party rule,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said before his entire caucus was joined by two Democrats in voting against the bill.

In his inaugural address last month, Biden used the word “unity” eight times and said, “We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.”

On Feb. 2, Klain cited a Yahoo News/YouGov poll showing that more than two-thirds of Americans support the policies in his American Rescue Plan. ""This IS a bipartisan agenda,"" he tweeted.

On Monday, Klain wrote that the plan ""has bipartisan support among voters; state/local leaders; business & labor,"" and that it ""should get the same in Congress.""

At a recent meeting with labor leaders in the Oval Office, Biden said that “based on the polling data,” Americans “want everything that’s in the plan — not a joke.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki has been peppered with questions from reporters in her daily briefings about whether Biden’s pledge to pursue a Covid-19 bill on a party-line vote breaks his promise of finding common ground.

“He didn’t run on a promise to unite the Democratic and Republican Party into one party in Washington,” Psaki said on Feb. 5. “This package has the vast majority of support from the American public.”",MSNBC,"['republican', 'bill', 'washington', 'unity', 'house', 'biden', 'support', 'pitches', 'votes', 'bidens', 'white', 'plan', 'bipartisan', 'covid']",0

2021-02-27 15:32:07+00:00,84,"WASHINGTON — The House voted early Saturday to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, a step to implementing his vision for bringing the pandemic under control just days after the U.S. crossed the tragic milestone of 500,000 deaths.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 219 to 212 to approve the bill, which includes $1,400 direct payments, a $400-a-week federal unemployment bonus, a per-child allowance of up to $3,600 for one year and billions of dollars to distribute the coronavirus vaccines and to assist schools and local governments.

The vote split largely on partisan lines, with every Republican voting against the measure and just two Democrats joining them — Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where a provision to raise the minimum wage is likely to be removed. But the rest of the package is in good shape to pass as Democrats are using a process that doesn't require Republican support.

If enacted, it would be the sixth round of aid from the federal government. The economy is still reeling from widespread shutdowns, and most Americans continue to wait their turns to be vaccinated. Democratic leaders want the bill to become law by March 14, when jobless benefits expire.

Biden thanked the House in a brief address Saturday morning and urged the Senate to move quickly to pass the bill and send it to his desk.

""We have no time to waste,"" Biden said. ""The people of this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering, and the American Rescue Plan does just that.""

Earlier Saturday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaking on the House floor, called the legislation ""transformative"" at mitigating poverty. ""We are putting money in workers' pockets... As President Biden has said, help is on the way.""

The legislation faces broad opposition from congressional Republicans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., decried it as a ""liberal pipedream"" and said Democrats were ""jamming it through in the dead of night.""

""Don’t call it a rescue bill. Don’t call it a relief bill,"" he said. ""For the American people, it is a loser.""

Recent polls show that the package is popular with most Americans, earning 66 percent support in an Economist/YouGov study and 76 percent support in a Morning Consult/Politico survey.

The $1,400 checks would be sent to individuals who make up to $75,000 a year or married couples making $150,000, and payments would gradually decrease for those who make more, zeroing out at $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for couples.

""Everything is not fixed. We have a long way to go. And that day when everything gets back to normal depends on all of us,"" Biden said Thursday at an event to mark the 50 millionth coronavirus vaccination shot. ""It depends on Congress passing the American Recovery Act.""

Progressives Angry About Minimum Wage

The House bill also includes a federal minimum wage hike from $7.25 to $15 per hour, phased in over four years. The provision, a top progressive priority, is all but doomed in the Senate after a ruling Thursday evening by the in-house referee that it violates the chamber's rules for legislation that can pass with a simple majority.

Biden had included the wage hike in his proposal. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in response to the ruling that the president is ""disappointed"" but ""respects the parliamentarian’s decision and the Senate’s process.""

Psaki said he would ""determine the best path forward"" on a minimum wage increase, but called on legislators to ""move quickly to pass"" the rest of the Covid-19 relief package in the meantime.

Pelosi said the House, which is not bound by the Senate's procedural restrictions, would keep the $15 wage provision in its bill on Friday despite the parliamentarian's decision.

""House Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary,"" she said.

The federal wage floor of $7.25 an hour hasn't risen since 2009.

After the parliamentarian ruling, top Senate Democrats immediately began looking for a way to use tax penalties to push companies to pay higher wages, which is more likely to comply with the rules.

Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Friday he's working on a ""plan B"" that would slap a 5 percent tax penalty on big corporations' overall payroll, growing over time, if their workers make less than a certain amount. It'd include ""safeguards"" against companies outsourcing labor or replacing workers with contractors to ""avoid paying living wages,"" he said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is considering adding to the Senate bill ""a new provision to penalize large corporations that don’t pay their workers at least a $15 minimum wage,"" said a senior Democratic aide.

Democrats are eager to address the issue in the reconciliation process because it would otherwise be subject to the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, all but ensuring its demise due to a lack of Republican support for their minimum wage plans.

The rest of the $1.9 trillion package has overwhelming support among Democratic lawmakers, and it is expected to become law, possibly with some changes in the Senate.

2021-02-27 06:32:05+00:00,32,"WASHINGTON — The White House will begin giving state governments more notice about how many doses they will be receiving to help officials plan for an expected influx of the Covid-19 vaccines.

Starting next week, states will be told how many doses to expect a month or more into the future. Currently, states receive only a three-week forecast, which is an increase from the one-week notice they had under the Trump administration, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to speak publicly.

While governors were warned that the longer-range outlooks could be less concrete and subject to change, officials hope it will allow states to plan better, the person said.

States are bracing for a massive increase of doses as Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is expected to receive emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration by next week, and Pfizer and Moderna are ramping up production of their own vaccines. If the manufacturers meet their targets, the United States could have 4 million doses a day within the next month, up from the 1.5 million shots a day currently being given.

Governors have been concerned they aren’t going to have enough notice about a significant increase in vaccines to be able to hire the staff and expand their vaccination centers to meet such an increase, a top aide for a Democratic governor said. The White House told the governors about the longer-range forecasts on its weekly call with them Tuesday.

Since taking office, the Biden administration has already increased the number of doses going to states by 70 percent. Not all of the new doses, though, will go directly to states to allocate. The federal government has increasingly been sending vaccines to retail pharmacies, community health centers and federally funded mass vaccination centers.

So far, 68 millions Americans have got at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",MSNBC,"['week', 'centers', 'states', 'administration', 'forecasts', 'increase', 'doses', 'influx', 'house', 'white', 'vaccines', 'expected', 'vaccination', 'vaccine', 'notice', 'covid', 'longrange']",0

(Case in point: The Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday that the $15-an-hour minimum wage hike can't stay in the bill.) That leaves little time for delay, despite grumbling from some Republicans that Biden didn't give them enough time to haggle.

But whether Republicans like it or not (and they don't) the bill as it stands is the only game in town right now. In response, they are pretty transparent about their efforts to obstruct like the dickens in the hope that they can turn around and blame Democrats for not getting anything done for Americans in the 2022 midterm elections. In effect, they're running the same play that they used effectively at the beginning of the Great Recession over a decade ago. But 2021 isn't 2009, and it's truly wild that Republicans can't see that yet.

In early February 2009, Gallup polls showed that about 52 percent of Americans were in favor of the $800 billion proposal that would eventually become the American Recovery and Relief Act. Only 24 percent of Republicans surveyed in the poll, taken soon after the deal passed in the House, supported the measure. If anything, it seemed like President Barack Obama's personal approval rating was buoying support for the bill overall.

And even though over two-thirds of Americans thought more money would need to be spent to stimulate the economy, the final bill was smaller than originally planned thanks to GOP criticism. This set Democrats up to fail, making the bill less effective and ultimately less popular. In other words, Republican opposition made some horrible degree of sense — a reality validated by GOP gains in the 2012 midterms.

Fast-forward to today and you'll find a vastly different situation. Given the political division in this country, Biden's proposal is almost absurdly popular, with sizable majorities backing it in recent polls. What's really amazing, though, is that the bill is only growing in popularity — including among Republican voters.

A poll by Quinnipiac University taken in the last week of January found that 68 percent of respondents were on board with Biden's plan, including about 37 percent of Republicans. A New York Times/SurveyMonkey poll taken the next week bumped that approval up to 72 percent of respondents and 43 percent of Republicans surveyed. But most eye-popping was this week's news that a new Morning Consult/Politico survey found that 60 percent of Republicans asked were at least somewhat supportive of the $1.9 trillion package. Overall, 76 percent of the respondents in that poll wanted the bill signed into law.

What's really amazing, though, is that the bill is only growing in popularity — including among Republican voters.

If that wasn't enough, you know who else loves this bill? Businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in favor of Biden's proposal early. Then, on Wednesday, more than 150 top business leaders signed a letter encouraging Congress to pass the bill posthaste. That included executives from ""AT&T, Blackstone, Comcast (the parent company of NBCUniversal), Corcoran, Goldman Sachs, Google, Saks Fifth Avenue, Siemens, T-Mobile and United Airlines,"" so, uh, not exactly a small segment of the economy.

Even elected Republicans back this bill, as long as they aren't coastal elites who spend their days in Washington, D.C. Out in the real heartland — places like Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma — mayors of cities in need of help are throwing their support behind Biden's stimulus efforts. As Mayor Bryan Barnett of Rochester Hills, Michigan, told USA Today, his constituents aren't interested in ""the games being played in Washington."" (And I've been to Rochester Hills, Michigan; it's not exactly a bastion of liberalism.)

Biden, to his credit, has done his best to get Republicans to see the writing on the wall. ""My hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents,"" he said during a Pfizer vaccine facility tour on Feb. 19. White House press secretary Jen Psaki wasn't joking when she told reporters Jan. 29 that despite the bill's moving forward in a way that won't require GOP defectors to pass in the Senate, ""Republicans can still vote for a package even if it goes through reconciliation.""

And yet, when the package passed out of the House Budget committee on Monday, it was on a party-line vote, with all 16 Republican members voting nay. The same day that Biden was asking Republicans to listen to their voters, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., sent out a message to his caucus urging a no vote.

Scalise's ""whip notice"" referred to the bill as the ""Pelosi's Payoff to Progressives Act,"" the latest in what has become an increasingly desperate messaging campaign. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., tried a similar tactic on Twitter on Wednesday, attempting to point out wasteful items hidden in the bill. But as far as dunks go, this was less a backboard breaker and more of a ""get the ball stuck behind the rim"" situation.

Now, there's still a chance that Republicans' cynical gamble will pay off for them politically. By fall 2010, just ahead of the midterms, the GOP's anti-Obama mantra had sunk in with voters — more than two-thirds of Americans thought the 2009 stimulus bill was ""a waste"" by then. But Democrats may have learned their lesson: Go big or go home. They aren't budging on the size and scope of the bill, making it less likely that its effects are forgotten quickly.

All this means that I, for one, am looking forward to the midterm commercials in 2022, when Republican members of the House are touting the benefits of the package while bending over backward to avoid citing where the funding came from.

2021-02-26 22:41:34+00:00,71,"An independent advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted Friday to recommend that the agency authorize Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine.

Members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, voted unanimously in favor of recommending the authorization.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""We have to keep in mind that we're still in the midst of a pandemic,"" said Dr. Archana Chatterjee, a panel member and an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Rosalind Franklin University in Chicago.

""There is a shortage of vaccines that are currently authorized,"" she added, saying the addition of a third vaccine would ""help meet the needs at the moment.""

The FDA is not required to go along with the committee's recommendation but is widely expected to, and could possibly issue an emergency use authorization as soon as Friday evening or Saturday. It would be the third Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the United States, in addition to vaccines from the drugmakers Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.

Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, made in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is a single shot and can be stored for three months at normal refrigeration temperatures. If authorized, it would be for people 18 years and older.

Previously released results from Phase 3 clinical trials showed the vaccine to be safe, and able to reduce moderate to severe outcomes from Covid-19 by about 72 percent in the U.S.

The effectiveness increased to more than 85 percent when researchers looked only at severe outcomes.

Among the study participants in South Africa, where a new variant has been spreading, efficacy was found to be 64 percent for moderate to severe disease.

Zero deaths or hospitalizations related to Covid-19 were reported among study participants within a month of receiving the vaccine. This suggests the vaccine may be able to turn Covid-19 from a potentially severe or deadly viral illness, to one that can be managed largely at home.

The analysis also suggested the vaccine may cut the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, from person to person, but more research is needed to confirm those results.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine differs from the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines in how it works. It uses an inactivated virus, called an adenovirus, to teach the immune system to be on alert for SARS-CoV-2. The other vaccines also work to educate the immune system, but use a different lesson plan: genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA.

One or two doses?

Though Johnson & Johnson studied its vaccine as a one-dose regimen in its Phase 3 clinical trials, studies of whether a second dose would be safe and boost effectiveness are ongoing.

Panel member Dr. Eric Rubin wondered what would happen if a two-dose formulation ultimately proves to be superior.

""We have a vaccine now that has good efficacy,"" said Rubin, an adjunct professor in the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""We're going to have a large number of people who've got a single dose out there. What do we do for them?"" he asked.

Another panel member, Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, suggested a two-dose vaccine might become a messaging challenge.

""You can see where that would be confusing to people where they may be thinking, 'Maybe I didn’t get what I need?'""

Chatterjee seemed to be less concerned about the potential for a two-dose regimen. ""We are in such a fluid situation,"" she said. ""This is going to evolve over time.""

Side effects

Johnson & Johnson reported that among the more than 43,000 clinical trial participants, the most common side effects were mild to moderate, and included fatigue, headache and pain at the injection site.

Five people who got the vaccine developed a rash, compared to one person in the placebo group.

One man had pain at the injection site that couldn't be helped with painkillers. Another participant had to be hospitalized with weakness, fever and headache, but recovered within four days.

And one man developed a severe allergic reaction, which included a rash, muscle weakness, fatigue and an itchy throat. The reaction, however, was not considered to qualify as the most severe form of an allergy, called anaphylaxis.

Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, spoke on behalf of Johnson & Johnson during Friday's meeting. He said there is ""compelling evidence"" that the vaccine is tolerated well.

""To me, it is clear that the known benefits vastly outweigh known risks, and meets the criteria for emergency use authorization,"" he said.

If authorized, the vaccine would greatly increase the supply of vaccines in the U.S. Johnson & Johnson has said it expects to provide 4 million shots immediately, 20 million shots by the end of March, and 100 million by summer.

Trials involving pregnant women are expected to begin in late March or early April, Dr. Johan Van Hoof of Janssen Pharmaceuticals said during Friday's meeting. Studies into the vaccine's safety and effectiveness among teenagers are also scheduled.

2021-02-26 17:02:06+00:00,58,"WASHINGTON — The White House will begin giving state governments more notice about how many doses they will be receiving to help officials plan for an expected influx of the Covid-19 vaccines.

Starting next week, states will be told how many doses to expect a month or more into the future. Currently, states receive only a three-week forecast, which is an increase from the one-week notice they had under the Trump administration, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to speak publicly.

While governors were warned that the longer-range outlooks could be less concrete and subject to change, officials hope it will allow states to plan better, the person said.

States are bracing for a massive increase of doses as Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is expected to receive emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration by next week, and Pfizer and Moderna are ramping up production of their own vaccines. If the manufacturers meet their targets, the United States could have 4 million doses a day within the next month, up from the 1.5 million shots a day currently being given.

Governors have been concerned they aren’t going to have enough notice about a significant increase in vaccines to be able to hire the staff and expand their vaccination centers to meet such an increase, a top aide for a Democratic governor said. The White House told the governors about the longer-range forecasts on its weekly call with them Tuesday.

Since taking office, the Biden administration has already increased the number of doses going to states by 70 percent. Not all of the new doses, though, will go directly to states to allocate. The federal government has increasingly been sending vaccines to retail pharmacies, community health centers and federally funded mass vaccination centers.

So far, 68 millions Americans have got at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",MSNBC,"['week', 'centers', 'states', 'administration', 'forecasts', 'increase', 'doses', 'influx', 'house', 'white', 'vaccines', 'expected', 'vaccination', 'vaccine', 'notice', 'covid', 'longrange']",0

The House is set to vote on the $1.9 trillion package as soon as Friday after weeks of shepherding the behemoth through various committees. But the bill will face a tougher challenge in the Senate, where changes will definitely be made. (Case in point: The Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday that the $15-an-hour minimum wage hike can't stay in the bill.) That leaves little time for delay, despite grumbling from some Republicans that Biden didn't give them enough time to haggle.

But whether Republicans like it or not (and they don't) the bill as it stands is the only game in town right now. In response, they are pretty transparent about their efforts to obstruct like the dickens in the hope that they can turn around and blame Democrats for not getting anything done for Americans in the 2022 midterm elections. In effect, they're running the same play that they used effectively at the beginning of the Great Recession over a decade ago. But 2021 isn't 2009, and it's truly wild that Republicans can't see that yet.

In early February 2009, Gallup polls showed that about 52 percent of Americans were in favor of the $800 billion proposal that would eventually become the American Recovery and Relief Act. Only 24 percent of Republicans surveyed in the poll, taken soon after the deal passed in the House, supported the measure. If anything, it seemed like President Barack Obama's personal approval rating was buoying support for the bill overall.

And even though over two-thirds of Americans thought more money would need to be spent to stimulate the economy, the final bill was smaller than originally planned thanks to GOP criticism. This set Democrats up to fail, making the bill less effective and ultimately less popular. In other words, Republican opposition made some horrible degree of sense — a reality validated by GOP gains in the 2012 midterms.

Fast-forward to today and you'll find a vastly different situation. Given the political division in this country, Biden's proposal is almost absurdly popular, with sizable majorities backing it in recent polls. What's really amazing, though, is that the bill is only growing in popularity — including among Republican voters.

A poll by Quinnipiac University taken in the last week of January found that 68 percent of respondents were on board with Biden's plan, including about 37 percent of Republicans. A New York Times/SurveyMonkey poll taken the next week bumped that approval up to 72 percent of respondents and 43 percent of Republicans surveyed. But most eye-popping was this week's news that a new Morning Consult/Politico survey found that 60 percent of Republicans asked were at least somewhat supportive of the $1.9 trillion package. Overall, 76 percent of the respondents in that poll wanted the bill signed into law.

What's really amazing, though, is that the bill is only growing in popularity — including among Republican voters.

If that wasn't enough, you know who else loves this bill? Businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in favor of Biden's proposal early. Then, on Wednesday, more than 150 top business leaders signed a letter encouraging Congress to pass the bill posthaste. That included executives from ""AT&T, Blackstone, Comcast (the parent company of NBCUniversal), Corcoran, Goldman Sachs, Google, Saks Fifth Avenue, Siemens, T-Mobile and United Airlines,"" so, uh, not exactly a small segment of the economy.

Even elected Republicans back this bill, as long as they aren't coastal elites who spend their days in Washington, D.C. Out in the real heartland — places like Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma — mayors of cities in need of help are throwing their support behind Biden's stimulus efforts. As Mayor Bryan Barnett of Rochester Hills, Michigan, told USA Today, his constituents aren't interested in ""the games being played in Washington."" (And I've been to Rochester Hills, Michigan; it's not exactly a bastion of liberalism.)

Biden, to his credit, has done his best to get Republicans to see the writing on the wall. ""My hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents,"" he said during a Pfizer vaccine facility tour on Feb. 19. White House press secretary Jen Psaki wasn't joking when she told reporters Jan. 29 that despite the bill's moving forward in a way that won't require GOP defectors to pass in the Senate, ""Republicans can still vote for a package even if it goes through reconciliation.""

And yet, when the package passed out of the House Budget committee on Monday, it was on a party-line vote, with all 16 Republican members voting nay. The same day that Biden was asking Republicans to listen to their voters, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., sent out a message to his caucus urging a no vote.

Scalise's ""whip notice"" referred to the bill as the ""Pelosi's Payoff to Progressives Act,"" the latest in what has become an increasingly desperate messaging campaign. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., tried a similar tactic on Twitter on Wednesday, attempting to point out wasteful items hidden in the bill. But as far as dunks go, this was less a backboard breaker and more of a ""get the ball stuck behind the rim"" situation.

Now, there's still a chance that Republicans' cynical gamble will pay off for them politically. By fall 2010, just ahead of the midterms, the GOP's anti-Obama mantra had sunk in with voters — more than two-thirds of Americans thought the 2009 stimulus bill was ""a waste"" by then. But Democrats may have learned their lesson: Go big or go home. They aren't budging on the size and scope of the bill, making it less likely that its effects are forgotten quickly.

All this means that I, for one, am looking forward to the midterm commercials in 2022, when Republican members of the House are touting the benefits of the package while bending over backward to avoid citing where the funding came from.

2021-02-26 15:02:04+00:00,43,"The Covid-19 pandemic has occurred amid heightened focus on economic and racial inequality in the U.S. As the Biden administration seeks a large Covid stimulus relief package, the everyday financial needs and stresses are greatest based on race, ethnicity and gender.

Forty percent of Latinos and half of Blacks are counting on another round of government financial assistance just to “get by” versus only 22 percent of white respondents who feel that level of financial anxiety, according to a new CNBC + Acorns Invest in You survey conducted by SurveyMonkey. Thirty-one percent of Asian-Americans said they were counting on stimulus relief payment.

Twenty percent of white respondents taking the survey said they don’t need stimulus checks, and that the government should give the money to someone else who needs it. That’s roughly twice the percentage of Blacks and Latinos who answered similarly.

Meanwhile, those who need the Covid financial assistance the most are less likely to receive it promptly. Though more than three-quarters (76 percent) of whites say they’ve received at least one Covid-19 aid payment from the government, only 67 percent of Hispanics and 65 percent of Blacks say they received the funds, according to the survey, which was conducted between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 among more than 6,100 Americans. Among Asian-Americans respondents, 61 percent said they received payments.

Louis Barajas, CFP, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council says the data on payment receipt may be explained by lower reliance on direct deposit by Latinos.

“Checks are likelier to get lost in the mail, so if you don’t have a bank account for direct deposit, then it’s easier to miss your stimulus payment,” says Barajas.

Emergencies and everyday expenses

The survey underscores the disparate day-to-day impact of the coronavirus pandemic by race and gender.

A plurality of survey respondents spent the stimulus payment on everyday expenses (31 percent), but a higher proportion of Latinos and Blacks spent it on rent or mortgage payments compared to whites. Among Latinos, 27 percent spent it on housing payments, the highest proportion of any group in the survey. Twenty-six percent of Black respondents indicated spending a stimulus payment on housing, versus 12 percent of whites.

The differences in access to liquid savings are also apparent: While 58 percent of whites would access their savings account if they needed $2,000 in an emergency, only 38 percent of Hispanics surveyed would do the same. Meanwhile, 14 percent of Latinos — the highest proportion of any group — responded that they would borrow it from a friend or relative, highlighting, perhaps a savings or traditional banking gap between racial groups.

White (20 percent) and Asian-American (25 percent) survey respondents were the most likely to say they saved a Covid stimulus payment, versus 9 percent of Black respondents and 14 percent of Latinos.

Polling conducted throughout the past year by SurveyMonkey and other research firms has continually shown people of color to be facing greater economic challenges as a result of the pandemic, including lost jobs and businesses shuttered, and they’re less likely to have been able to work from home, putting them at increased risk of being exposed to Covid-19, according to SurveyMonkey.

“These latest data demonstrate how people of color are in a much more precarious financial position, which the pandemic has only exacerbated,” said Laura Wronski, science research scientist at SurveyMonkey.

The firm’s recent polling shows that Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan gets support from about seven in 10 people across the country, which is very high, but that support is even higher among minorities.

“These latest data give a clear reason why: Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are just more reliant on the federal help during this crisis, and they’re more worried than others that they won’t be able to get by without it,” she said.

Pandemic fallout: More debt, financial emergencies

Seventy-three percent of Americans have at least one form of debt, according to the survey, and Latinos are the group with the highest proportion of credit card debt and student loan debt, while African-Americans are the most likely to have medical debt.

“I’ve seen that some Hispanics have been taking on a lot of credit card debt during the pandemic to pay for essential expenses,” Barajas said.

Additionally, 40 percent of Americans had to take emergency measures to manage their finances in the wake of the pandemic. The top three actions taken: tapping emergency savings (13 percent), borrowing money from a family member or friend (12 percent), and using a food bank (11 percent).

“Latinos are very family-oriented, and I’ve seen many families helping each other out more than ever. I’ve seen many families lending their kids money when they’ve lost jobs because of Covid,” Barajas said. “Family unity and pooling resources has been a big help for Latinos during this crisis.”

Minority females were most broadly affected by the pandemic. African-American and Hispanic women report the highest rates of emergency financial measures, with 23 percent of African-American women and 17 percent of Hispanic women borrowing from family or friends, compared to only 9 percent of white men. Additionally, 21 percent of African-American women and 19 percent of Hispanics used a food bank, compared to 9 percent of African-American or Hispanic men, and 8 percent of white men.

Some Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans were able to take positive financial steps during the pandemic, with 10 percent of Latinos opening a bank account and a retirement account for the first time in the past 12 months, and 11 percent of African-Americans making similar moves.

Thirteen percent of Latinos and Blacks bought stocks for the first time; that figure was 14 percent among Asian-Americans. Some Latinos also achieved the American dream of home ownership for the first time: 6 percent of Hispanics bought their first home during the pandemic.

2021-02-26 01:10:43+00:00,21,"WASHINGTON — A ruling in the Senate on Thursday dealt a severe blow to Democrats' hopes of raising the minimum wage in the Covid-19 relief package, probably dooming the proposal in the legislation that is headed for a vote in Congress.

The parliamentarian, the in-house referee, ruled that the provision was not compliant with rules governing the budget process that Congress is using to pass the bill with simple majorities.

""We are deeply disappointed in this decision,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""We are not going to give up the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 to help millions of struggling American workers and their families. The American people deserve it, and we are committed to making it a reality.""

The so-called Byrd rule limits acceptable provisions in the reconciliation process to those that involve taxing and spending. Democrats can still try to pass a wage hike through regular order, but that would require 60 Senate votes, which all but ensures failure because of a lack of Republican support.

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, praised the referee's ruling.

""Very pleased the Senate Parliamentarian has ruled that a minimum wage increase is an inappropriate policy change in reconciliation,"" Graham said in a statement. ""This decision reinforces reconciliation cannot be used as a vehicle to pass major legislative change — by either party — on a simple majority vote. This decision will, over time, reinforce the traditions of the Senate.""

Democrats, led by Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had made a case for including the provision.

Sanders said he strongly disagreed with the ruling and suggested another way to provide incentives for a wage hike through the budget process.

""In the coming days, I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to move forward with an amendment to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages,"" he said in a statement. ""That amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill.""

Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he would consider another way to raise wages.

""I'm looking at a tax penalty for mega-corporations that refuse to pay a living wage,"" Wyden said in a statement provided by his office.

The House, which isn't constrained by the Senate restrictions, is expected to take up the Covid-19 relief bill Friday. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said House Democrats ""believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary"" and added: ""Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan on the Floor tomorrow.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leading proponent of the $15-an-hour wage, said before the ruling that it would be unacceptable for Democrats to willingly back off the provision, but she acknowledged that the parliamentarian could rule it to be noncompliant.

""The parliamentarian is essentially a legislative reference,"" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters. ""If something is out of bounds, it's out of bounds, as per the rules.""

Senate experts say Vice President Kamala Harris has the authority to ignore the parliamentarian and rule the wage hike to be compliant, but the White House isn't considering that.

""President Biden is disappointed in this outcome,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, but she added that he ""respects the parliamentarian's decision and the Senate's process."" She said that he will work with Congress to ""determine the best path forward"" on a $15 wage but that, in the meantime, he ""urges Congress to move quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan.""

The parliamentarian's ruling immediately revived calls from some progressive activists for Democrats to abolish the Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation, which they can do with a majority vote.

Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for the Fix Our Senate coalition, said there is ""no reason"" for the party not to extend the simple majority process it is using for Covid-19 relief ""to increasing the minimum wage, passing HR1 and the Voting Rights Act, and delivering on the many popular promises they made that Sen.

""We must speak truth about the history of medical testing in this country,"" Harris said in an interview with MSNBC's Rev. Al Sharpton.

""We must be honest about the fact that people have a righteous skepticism about how it has been used, how it has been tested and on whom it will be used,"" Harris said.

The U.S. has a long record of unethical medical experimentation on Black Americans, from non-consensual testing on slaves to forced sterilization during the early 20th century and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. As NBC News has reported, experts have cautioned that this history, along with broader health care disparities in the modern era, has led to a distrust of the vaccine's safety.

Harris pointed to her own experience receiving the Covid vaccine to build trust in others.

""I got vaccinated,"" she said. ""I can tell you first of all that these vaccines are safe. It will save your life. There is a Black woman, Dr. Kizzy Corbet, who was part of the team of scientists who created this vaccine and it will save your life.""

""So, get your vaccination when it is your turn,"" Harris said.

But the vaccines' chaotic rollout, including supply shortages and disruptions with distribution due to winter storms, has created widespread accessibility issues.

The Biden administration recently purchased 200 million doses, and it doubled in distribution numbers last week, sending two million doses to 7,000 pharmacies across the country with its Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. The last five weeks have seen a nearly 70 percent increase in vaccine distribution.

Harris visited a local pharmacy and program participant in Washington D.C. Thursday morning, where she also addressed vaccine skepticism.

“There have been many theories about populations that are experiencing vaccine hesitancy for legitimate reasons that are based on historical experience that we should never forget,” Harris said.

2021-02-25 13:42:57+00:00,30,"Weekly initial jobless claims fell to 730,000 last week, far below economists' estimates of 845,000 and a positive sign despite freezing weather across parts of the country, a nearly yearlong pandemic and a lack of additional stimulus.

While the latest figure from the Department of Labor snaps the six-week streak of first-time claims above 800,000, it is still the 49th week that the number has been higher than at any time during the Great Recession. Nearly a year into the pandemic, the weekly figures remain far above the pre-coronavirus average of 200,000 claims a week.

""For months, there’s been no substantial improvement in the magnitude of total initial claims,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Long-term joblessness is a reality for millions of Americans. Economic pain is still being felt and, unfortunately, there is no quick fix. Only once the virus is under control can a robust economic recovery take root, which should bolster hiring and help pull the jobless back into work.""

The hardest-hit industries are those in the service sectors and those that depend on travel and face-to-face customer engagement, such as restaurants, hospitality, and leisure.

Continuing claims fell to 4.419 million, still double their pre-pandemic levels, as more Americans burn through their six months of state unemployment benefits and turn to long-term federal unemployment benefits.

While the official unemployment rate is at 6.3 percent, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said the true figure was closer to 10 percent once the numbers included all the workers who stopped looking for work. Women, in particular, abandoned their job search in order to take care of their family

“Women have taken on more of the child care duties than men have at a time when kids are going to be at home,"" Powell said Wednesday in his semiannual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. “Some parts of the economy have a long way to go.""",MSNBC,"['fall', '845000', '730000', 'months', 'claims', 'unemployment', 'powell', 'nearly', 'pandemic', 'weekly', 'latest', 'parts', 'expected', 'jobless', 'vs', 'longterm', 'week']",0

Mercia Bowser, 64, was Bowser's older sister.

""Mercia was loved immensely and will be missed greatly, as she joins the legion of angels who have gone home too soon due to the pandemic,"" Bowser, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Mercia Bowser had been treated for Covid-19-related pneumonia.

New reported cases of the disease have been in decline across the country in recent weeks, but health experts say the number of new coronavirus infections is still high.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""The baseline of daily infections is still very, very high,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

2021-02-25 08:32:02+00:00,29,"A box with almost two dozen Moderna Covid-19 vaccines was found on the street of a mountainous town in rural Puerto Rico, officials said Wednesday.

The reports surfaced after a resident of the town of Morovis handed a box that contained syringes and vaccine vials to officers of the Morovis Municipal Police. The person claimed to have found the box in a street in the Barahona neighborhood in Morovis.

Morovis Mayor Carmen Maldonado said she spoke with Puerto Rico's Deputy Health Secretary, Dr. Iris Cardona, ""so that the case can be investigated immediately. Thanks to the Morovis citizen who responsibly called the Municipal Police and filed the corresponding complaint,"" Maldonado tweeted in Spanish on Wednesday.

A few hours later, Puerto Rican Health Secretary Carlos Mellado announced his agency launched an investigation looking into how 21 vaccines ""were lost.""

""I'm very upset and, most of all, outraged,” Mellado said in Spanish. ""We have to investigate, up to the last consequences, because there is a pressing interest of the Puerto Rican people to know what happened.""

Investigators found that the vaccines had been delivered to a Walgreens pharmacy, under federal contract, meant for residents at a long-term care facility, according to Mellado.

Walgreens said they were ""transporting Moderna vaccines to a long-term care center in Morovis to administer them, a cooler containing a limited amount of vaccine doses that was not properly secured fell from the vehicle,"" Puerto Rican national newspaper, El Nuevo Día, reported.

“We are very grateful to the person who found the cooler and alerted the local police. We will be investigating the matter and reviewing our procedures with the team so that this does not happen again,"" Walgreens said.

On Friday, Mellado announced that his agency will be referring the case to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention given that Walgreens has a contract with the federal agency. They are also alerting the Food and Drug Administration as well as the Department of Justice in Puerto Rico, ""in case the specific event needs further investigation,"" Mellado said.

Walgreens will likely face fines for violating health regulations that specifically outline how to properly manage the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, among other applicable provisions, according to Puerto Rican health officials.

While Walgreens ""has been our ally in the vaccination process"" and has helped vaccinate over 50,000 patients in Puerto Rico, Mellado said it is his agency's ""responsibility to ensure and guarantee the proper handling of the vaccine for Covid-19.""

""I trust that all of our providers will emphasize the protocols in the handling of the vaccine, so that not one more dose is wasted,"" Mellado said. ""The Department of Health will ensure that the vaccine is used in the appropriate way and that the protocols are followed.""

On the island of 3.2 million people, the virus has infected at least 92,198 people and killed 2,023.

Puerto Rico has received nearly 630,000 Covid-19 doses so far. Of these, at least 598,000 have already been distributed across the island and over 418,000 have already been administered, officials at the a press conference Wednesday said.

The favorable review comes two days before a panel of independent advisers to the FDA is scheduled to discuss the company's application for emergency use. It is widely expected that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will vote to recommend authorization of the vaccine.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""The FDA went so far as to say the vaccine has a 'favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA,"" or emergency use authorization, said John Grabenstein, a former executive director of medical affairs for vaccines at Merck and a former Department of Defense immunologist.

""In other words,"" he said, ""green light.""

The FDA is not required to go along with the panel's recommendation, but it usually does.

""If authorized, we are ready to roll out this vaccine without delay,"" Jeff Zients, coordinator for the Biden administration's Covid-19 task force, said during a media briefing Wednesday.

On Tuesday, five Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson, told Congress that they're working to ramp up the rollout of doses over the coming weeks and months.

Assuming the FDA will authorize the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for emergency use, the company said it would be able to provide 20 million shots by the end of next month, with an additional 100 million doses over the summer.

The company reported results of its phase 3 clinical trials in late January, finding that in the U.S., the shot was 72 percent effective in preventing moderate to severe disease — essentially, keeping people out of the hospital and dying from Covid-19.

When the company looked just at the shot's effect on preventing severe disease, it was 85 percent effective. The new analysis shows a slight increase, to 86 percent.

Globally, however, the vaccine's effectiveness against moderate to severe disease was lower: 66 percent. That's due to a decrease in effectiveness against the variant first found in South Africa. In that country, the vaccine's effectiveness fell to 57 percent in the interim analysis.

However, the new FDA analysis shows an improvement in the shot's efficacy in South Africa, now found to be 64 percent.

Side effects were generally limited to arm pain, headache and fatigue. No deaths were reported among study participants who received the vaccine, and no hospitalizations were reported after 28 days.

""We need to keep our eye on the prize, which is to take this potentially fatal virus and turn it into nothing more than a cold,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease expert, as well as a principal investigator of one of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine trials at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

The new analysis also suggested the vaccine can reduce person-to-person transmission of the virus, though more research is needed.

Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, made in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is given in a single shot; the other two vaccines in use from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, require two doses, three to four weeks apart.

The Johnson & Johnson shot only requires basic refrigeration for storage.

It uses an inactivated virus, called an adenovirus, to teach the body's immune system to recognize and fight off SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use a different type of technology, using genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA.

As Biden highlighted the hundreds of thousands who have perished, he also urged Americans to remember those still reeling from having lost loved ones.

Biden, who often draws on his personal losses when addressing national tragedies, compared their grief to what he experienced after the deaths of his first wife and infant daughter, as well as his eldest son Beau.

""I know what it’s like to not be there when it happens,"" he said. ""I know what it’s like when you are there, holding your hands, looking in their eyes as they slip away.""

""That’s how you heal, you have to remember. The day will come when the memory of the loved one you lost will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eye,"" he added, saying that ""for me the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose.""

The United States on Sunday hit the half-a-million mark for the number of lives claimed by Covid-19.

Nearly a year since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, 100,000 Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. was the low estimate. Early on, cities such as New York and Chicago were hit hard, particularly in communities of color. Then, hot spots in nursing homes and meatpacking plants began to emerge as the virus hit suburban and rural communities.

The death toll in the U.S. would eventually eclipse that of every other country, and has claimed many more lives since then.

The president said he keeps a card in his pocket every day with the tally of those who have died from Covid-19.

""The people we lost were extraordinary,"" Biden said. ""We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow.""

As Biden highlighted the hundreds of thousands who have perished, he also urged Americans to remember those still reeling from having lost loved ones.

Biden, who often draws on his personal losses when addressing national tragedies, compared their grief to what he experienced after the deaths of his first wife and infant daughter, as well as his eldest son Beau.

""I know what it’s like to not be there when it happens,"" he said. ""I know what it’s like when you are there, holding your hands, looking in their eyes as they slip away.""

""That’s how you heal, you have to remember. The day will come when the memory of the loved one you lost will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eye,"" he added, saying that ""for me the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose.""

Daily deaths are decreasing, too, but more slowly, still regularly eclipsing 2,000.

2021-02-22 19:02:06+00:00,28,"DETROIT — While most Covid-19 vaccination clinics around the country are focused primarily on first responders, essential workers and seniors, the city of Detroit is now offering shots to residents who haven’t made vaccination priority lists almost anywhere else in the country.

Among them: Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, vision or hearing impairments, and other intellectual and developmental disabilities.

“I was surprised to see that and very happy,” said Bonnielin Swenor, an epidemiologist and the director of the Disability Health Research Center at Johns Hopkins University. “It means people in the disability community were listened to, were considered, and prioritization was revised in a way that is really remarkable.”

The city’s move will lead to more equity and access for people with disabilities that Swenor hopes other communities will emulate. “It has the potential to spark a really important change,” she said.

At the same time, the decision to prioritize people with conditions that aren’t necessarily known to increase the risk of dying from Covid-19 points to the difficult and delicate choices facing local and state policymakers in a country where vaccination criteria differ considerably from one community to the next.

In much of the country, two people with the same job, who are the same age and are in similar health, could face radically different odds of accessing the shots depending on where they live, where they get medical treatment and the political landscape in their state.

And within communities like Detroit, where people in their 20s with ADHD can now get vaccinated ahead of people in their 50s with chronic heart or lung conditions, it can lead to difficult questions about whose health should come first.

“These are the judgments that we are making every step of the way,” Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said during a news conference Wednesday as he announced that Detroiters 60 and older with serious physical health conditions could get vaccinated.

Some of the disabilities the city added earlier have been linked to higher risks of dying from Covid-19. Others, such as autism and ADHD, make it difficult to socially distance and wear a mask.

“When everybody in a particular category has had a chance to get a vaccine, we go to the next category,” Duggan said of a city effort to vaccinate 15,000 people a week using an eligibility list that now includes teachers, waiters, grocery clerks, clergy members, postal workers and the homeless. “We went to what we believe to be the next highest risk category.”

‘Overwhelming’ need

The push to prioritize people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Detroit came from advocates who flooded the mayor’s office with letters and blitzed local media to call attention to the extra challenges people with disabilities face as they try to avoid infection or get treated for Covid-19.

“People with disabilities are being left out of Covid vaccine rollouts and being left out of data collection when somebody contracts Covid, and that leads to disparities,” said Dessa Cosma, the executive director of Detroit Disability Power, a social justice organization that led the letter-writing campaign.

When Cosma heard that Duggan planned to announce, on Feb. 11, that adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities, along with their caregivers, would be added to the city’s vaccination list, she thought perhaps the mayor would narrow eligibility to people with conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Those disorders have been more conclusively linked to higher Covid-19 rates or deaths.

Instead, she was thrilled — and proud — to see that Duggan went broad, including all intellectual and developmental disabilities and specifically naming six conditions, in addition to Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Among them were autism, Tourette syndrome, hearing and vision impairment, and ADHD, a neurological condition that affects nearly 5 percent of U.S. adults, causing impulsivity, hyperactivity and difficulty focusing.

Since everyone’s condition is unique, Cosma said, a broad definition is crucial to prevent “some very marginalized people from falling through the cracks.”

That broad definition sets Detroit apart.

Many states have adopted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines recommending that people with Down syndrome be prioritized, and others have prioritized people with developmental and intellectual disabilities who live in group homes. But just a handful of states, including New York, Delaware, Missouri and New Mexico, list people with disabilities among those eligible for a vaccination before the general public.

Among those states, none explicitly include ADHD or visual and hearing impairments among qualifying conditions, though people can make a case with a doctor’s note if they believe they should be eligible.

Even Michigan doesn’t include intellectual or developmental disabilities other than Down syndrome among its vaccination priorities. Detroit was able to include disabled residents because local communities “have the option to prioritize the groups within the guidance they feel are most at risk and at highest need of vaccination,” Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said in an email.

When Duggan made the disability announcement last week, he touted the “overwhelming” need to reach people with conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus. A spokesman said the city drew its list of diagnoses from the CDC’s definitions of developmental and intellectual disabilities.

‘Trying to get in the line’

Advocates for people with disabilities who have been pushing for vaccine priority across the country applauded Detroit’s decision, especially given the many ways that residents here are struggling.

In a city where nearly 90 percent of residents are Black or Latino and where 35 percent live in poverty, people with disabilities face multiple layers of discrimination and barriers to health care that put them at higher risk for Covid-19, said Justice Shorter, the disaster protection adviser for the National Disability Rights Network.

Detroit has been hit hard by the pandemic, tallying more than 1,800 deaths, including Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, state Rep. Isaac Robinson and a long list of community leaders.

Some of the disabilities on the city’s list might seem surprising to people not living with those conditions, Shorter, who is blind, said.

“In medical terms, blindness itself might not be considered something that would put you at a heightened risk for Covid,” she said, unless you consider that people with visual impairments rely on others to drive them around or point out hazards, and can’t see whether someone offering to help is wearing a mask.

“You have to consider the ways in which you maneuver through society,” she said.

As for ADHD, advocates note that people with the disorder might not realize they’re too close to others. They might impulsively touch people or things and might get distracted and forget to wash their hands or wear a mask — all behaviors that would put them at higher risk for coronavirus infection.

They also might behave in ways that put off doctors or nurses and affect their ability to get quality health care.

“They may be perceived as difficult to work with, so providers may choose to refer them out or may not be adequately trained to address patients’ needs,” said Emily Hotez, an assistant professor in developmental psychology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who wrote a commentary calling for people with ADHD, autism and other disabilities to get vaccination priority.

While there has been some research on disabilities and Covid-19, advocates say more is needed. They note that disabilities are often left out of statistics that tally virus or death rates by age, race and location.

Not much is known about how ADHD in particular affects Covid-19 outcomes beyond a study last year that found that people with the disorder are more likely to contract the virus, Hotez said. Another study found that people with ADHD who contract the virus are less likely to die from it than others.

Some people with ADHD say they do not consider themselves developmentally disabled and questioned whether their condition should get priority.

“I would make sure that other people who could benefit from it more would get it first,” said David Penalver, 20, an aerospace engineering student at North Carolina State University who was diagnosed with ADHD last year.

But when told that a reason advocates believe people with ADHD should get priority is because of behaviors associated with higher coronavirus infections, Penalver reconsidered.

“That’s a good point,” he said. “I happen to have my hands on my face right now. I didn’t even think about that but, certainly, I’m touching handrails and surfaces going up and down stairs. I have a tendency to fidget. I touch my face. I bite my nails.”

Penalver isn’t alone in not immediately considering the ways that neurological and physical differences put people at risk, both during a pandemic and at other times, said Swenor, the epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins University.

“I hope more of that starts to happen even beyond Covid,” she said.

Cosma, from Detroit Disability Power, said her organization has turned its attention to getting intellectual and developmental disabilities added to vaccination priority lists in the rest of Michigan. She is also in contact with advocates who are making similar demands in other states.

“We’re trying to get in the line,” said Cosma, who has a developmental disability and uses a wheelchair, and who was vaccinated this week. “We’re not trying to cut the line.”",MSNBC,"['queue', 'disabilities', 'detroits', 'conditions', 'health', 'detroit', 'include', 'disability', 'intellectual', 'risk', 'adhd', 'developmental', 'covid', 'vaccination']",0
2021-02-22 18:16:08+00:00,27,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is kicking off a series of meetings Monday with leaders from communities with high levels of skepticism about getting the coronavirus vaccine as multiple administration officials say the White House is preparing to unveil its much-anticipated campaign next month aimed at building confidence and dispelling doubts.

The meetings, which will be led by the chair of the administration’s Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force, Marcella Nunez-Smith, also will focus on ways to make getting the vaccine easier by resolving issues such as unpaid time off from work and access to transportation. The first meeting on Monday will be with Black community leaders, the administration official said, followed by others with Latino groups, faith leaders and Americans in rural communities.

“To defeat this pandemic, we must reach all people, from all backgrounds and communities with the lifesaving vaccines that are going to help them protect themselves and their friends and families from this deadly virus,” Nunez-Smith said in a statement. “These listening sessions will further our work to hear directly from those communities who have been hit hardest by this pandemic and help us build strong partnerships with those who will be key to our efforts to build vaccine confidence and reach everyone in our response.”

Also on Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to begin a three-day National Forum on Vaccines with medical personnel “to discuss practical strategies, technical resources, and best practices for vaccination efforts.”

Multiple administration officials said the goal is to roll out the administration’s widespread vaccine confidence campaign in March, though no final decision has been made and details are still being worked out. They said that within the broad, national effort there will be specific messaging for communities that are particularly vulnerable to the virus or have a high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy.

“It’s nationwide in scope but also targeted to communities,” one senior administration official said. “It’s a big undertaking.”

The campaign is expected to have a similar scope to a presidential campaign — an overarching national message as well as targeted outreach to specific communities on the ground that would enlist local officials, doctors and faith leaders acting as validators for vaccine safety, officials said. The idea is to convey the message not just from well-known political figures, celebrities and high-profile organizations but also churches and community leaders, officials said.

Another senior administration official described planning for the public campaign as in the “homestretch.” And while one of the officials said the goal for a roll out is early March, other officials cautioned the timing is likely later.

Officials also stressed the timing of the campaign is contingent, at least in part, on the availability of the vaccine, noting that it wouldn’t make sense to encourage Americans to take it while there’s still a lack of vaccine supply in many parts of the country.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently said the administration’s public, vaccine confidence-building campaign would be “massive” and designed to ensure “we’re making sure that the American people know it’s safe.”

NBC News previously reported that in lieu of the larger vaccine confidence campaign, which has in part been complicated by insufficient supplies of the vaccine to meet demand, the administration has been tailoring a smaller effort to communities where people may be skeptical of taking the shots.

The administration has explored ideas for reaching diverse audiences, including potentially through sports organizations such as NASCAR and the NFL, and how businesses might help by, for instance, agreeing to give employees time off to receive the vaccine.",MSNBC,"['communities', 'administration', 'national', 'biden', 'vaccineskeptical', 'outreach', 'official', 'help', 'officials', 'leaders', 'campaign', 'vaccine', 'makes', 'confidence']",0

2021-02-22 05:02:06+00:00,52,"DETROIT — While most Covid-19 vaccination clinics around the country are focused primarily on first responders, essential workers and seniors, the city of Detroit is now offering shots to residents who haven’t made vaccination priority lists almost anywhere else in the country.

Among them: Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, vision or hearing impairments, and other intellectual and developmental disabilities.

“I was surprised to see that and very happy,” said Bonnielin Swenor, an epidemiologist and the director of the Disability Health Research Center at Johns Hopkins University. “It means people in the disability community were listened to, were considered, and prioritization was revised in a way that is really remarkable.”

The city’s move will lead to more equity and access for people with disabilities that Swenor hopes other communities will emulate. “It has the potential to spark a really important change,” she said.

At the same time, the decision to prioritize people with conditions that aren’t necessarily known to increase the risk of dying from Covid-19 points to the difficult and delicate choices facing local and state policymakers in a country where vaccination criteria differ considerably from one community to the next.

In much of the country, two people with the same job, who are the same age and are in similar health, could face radically different odds of accessing the shots depending on where they live, where they get medical treatment and the political landscape in their state.

And within communities like Detroit, where people in their 20s with ADHD can now get vaccinated ahead of people in their 50s with chronic heart or lung conditions, it can lead to difficult questions about whose health should come first.

“These are the judgments that we are making every step of the way,” Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said during a news conference Wednesday as he announced that Detroiters 60 and older with serious physical health conditions could get vaccinated.

Some of the disabilities the city added earlier have been linked to higher risks of dying from Covid-19. Others, such as autism and ADHD, make it difficult to socially distance and wear a mask.

“When everybody in a particular category has had a chance to get a vaccine, we go to the next category,” Duggan said of a city effort to vaccinate 15,000 people a week using an eligibility list that now includes teachers, waiters, grocery clerks, clergy members, postal workers and the homeless. “We went to what we believe to be the next highest risk category.”

‘Overwhelming’ need

The push to prioritize people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Detroit came from advocates who flooded the mayor’s office with letters and blitzed local media to call attention to the extra challenges people with disabilities face as they try to avoid infection or get treated for Covid-19.

“People with disabilities are being left out of Covid vaccine rollouts and being left out of data collection when somebody contracts Covid, and that leads to disparities,” said Dessa Cosma, the executive director of Detroit Disability Power, a social justice organization that led the letter-writing campaign.

When Cosma heard that Duggan planned to announce, on Feb. 11, that adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities, along with their caregivers, would be added to the city’s vaccination list, she thought perhaps the mayor would narrow eligibility to people with conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Those disorders have been more conclusively linked to higher Covid-19 rates or deaths.

Instead, she was thrilled — and proud — to see that Duggan went broad, including all intellectual and developmental disabilities and specifically naming six conditions, in addition to Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Among them were autism, Tourette syndrome, hearing and vision impairment, and ADHD, a neurological condition that affects nearly 5 percent of U.S. adults, causing impulsivity, hyperactivity and difficulty focusing.

Since everyone’s condition is unique, Cosma said, a broad definition is crucial to prevent “some very marginalized people from falling through the cracks.”

That broad definition sets Detroit apart.

Many states have adopted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines recommending that people with Down syndrome be prioritized, and others have prioritized people with developmental and intellectual disabilities who live in group homes. But just a handful of states, including New York, Delaware, Missouri and New Mexico, list people with disabilities among those eligible for a vaccination before the general public.

Among those states, none explicitly include ADHD or visual and hearing impairments among qualifying conditions, though people can make a case with a doctor’s note if they believe they should be eligible.

Even Michigan doesn’t include intellectual or developmental disabilities other than Down syndrome among its vaccination priorities. Detroit was able to include disabled residents because local communities “have the option to prioritize the groups within the guidance they feel are most at risk and at highest need of vaccination,” Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said in an email.

When Duggan made the disability announcement last week, he touted the “overwhelming” need to reach people with conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus. A spokesman said the city drew its list of diagnoses from the CDC’s definitions of developmental and intellectual disabilities.

‘Trying to get in the line’

Advocates for people with disabilities who have been pushing for vaccine priority across the country applauded Detroit’s decision, especially given the many ways that residents here are struggling.

In a city where nearly 90 percent of residents are Black or Latino and where 35 percent live in poverty, people with disabilities face multiple layers of discrimination and barriers to health care that put them at higher risk for Covid-19, said Justice Shorter, the disaster protection adviser for the National Disability Rights Network.

Detroit has been hit hard by the pandemic, tallying more than 1,800 deaths, including Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, state Rep. Isaac Robinson and a long list of community leaders.

Some of the disabilities on the city’s list might seem surprising to people not living with those conditions, Shorter, who is blind, said.

“In medical terms, blindness itself might not be considered something that would put you at a heightened risk for Covid,” she said, unless you consider that people with visual impairments rely on others to drive them around or point out hazards, and can’t see whether someone offering to help is wearing a mask.

“You have to consider the ways in which you maneuver through society,” she said.

As for ADHD, advocates note that people with the disorder might not realize they’re too close to others. They might impulsively touch people or things and might get distracted and forget to wash their hands or wear a mask — all behaviors that would put them at higher risk for coronavirus infection.

They also might behave in ways that put off doctors or nurses and affect their ability to get quality health care.

“They may be perceived as difficult to work with, so providers may choose to refer them out or may not be adequately trained to address patients’ needs,” said Emily Hotez, an assistant professor in developmental psychology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who wrote a commentary calling for people with ADHD, autism and other disabilities to get vaccination priority.

While there has been some research on disabilities and Covid-19, advocates say more is needed. They note that disabilities are often left out of statistics that tally virus or death rates by age, race and location.

Not much is known about how ADHD in particular affects Covid-19 outcomes beyond a study last year that found that people with the disorder are more likely to contract the virus, Hotez said. Another study found that people with ADHD who contract the virus are less likely to die from it than others.

Some people with ADHD say they do not consider themselves developmentally disabled and questioned whether their condition should get priority.

“I would make sure that other people who could benefit from it more would get it first,” said David Penalver, 20, an aerospace engineering student at North Carolina State University who was diagnosed with ADHD last year.

But when told that a reason advocates believe people with ADHD should get priority is because of behaviors associated with higher coronavirus infections, Penalver reconsidered.

“That’s a good point,” he said. “I happen to have my hands on my face right now. I didn’t even think about that but, certainly, I’m touching handrails and surfaces going up and down stairs. I have a tendency to fidget. I touch my face. I bite my nails.”

Penalver isn’t alone in not immediately considering the ways that neurological and physical differences put people at risk, both during a pandemic and at other times, said Swenor, the epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins University.

“I hope more of that starts to happen even beyond Covid,” she said.

Cosma, from Detroit Disability Power, said her organization has turned its attention to getting intellectual and developmental disabilities added to vaccination priority lists in the rest of Michigan. She is also in contact with advocates who are making similar demands in other states.

2021-02-22 02:03:03+00:00,60,"WASHINGTON — The severe winter storms that have devastated Texas and surrounding states have delayed the distribution of 6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, but Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that it's only a ""temporary setback"" that will be fixed by the middle of the week.

""Obviously, it is a setback, because you'd like to see the steady flow of vaccine getting out there to get into people's arms. But we can play pretty good catch-up,"" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview on NBC News' ""Meet the Press.""

""The number was 6 million doses got delayed. We've gotten 2 million out, and we project that by the middle of the week we will have caught up.""

The brutal weather left millions of people without power as temperatures plummeted. And even as power is returning, broken pipes mean many still lack clean water. President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in 77 counties across Texas, making them eligible for federal recovery funds, and some emergency management officials want to include the entire state in the disaster declaration.

The rough weather prompted what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called ""widespread delays in Covid-19 vaccine shipments and deliveries."" Power failures also forced some health care officials to quickly administer vaccine doses before they spoiled.

More than 57 million doses of the vaccines have been administered — with 41 million first doses administered and 16 million people fully vaccinated with the two-dose regimen — according to an NBC News analysis.

The average daily number of Covid-19 cases continues to plummet from a post-holiday peak. The U.S. has reported more than 100,000 new daily cases on only one of the last 14 days, a month after it regularly hit more than 200,000 new cases, according to NBC News data.

2021-02-21 20:02:06+00:00,27,"Beating back Covid-19 right now comes down to balancing supply and demand. With hopes pinned to vaccines, demand has far outstripped the supply of doses.

But, as an increasing number of vaccine vials are shipped in coming weeks, the concern about shortages may well shift to human capital: the vaccinators themselves.

“We need to mobilize more medical units to get more shots in people’s arms,” Jeff Zients, coordinator of President Joe Biden's Covid-19 task force, said at a briefing earlier this month.

Already, there have been scattered reports that vaccinators are in short supply in some areas.

“Absolutely, we do need more,” said Tom Kraus, vice president of government relations for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, whose members work in hospitals, clinics and large physician practices.

After all, vaccinating America is a huge undertaking.

“We are planning to vaccinate a lot more people over a shorter period of time than we’ve ever done before,” said L.J Tan, chief strategy officer of the Immunization Action Coalition, which distributes educational materials for health care professionals and the public across a range of vaccination topics.

Each year the U.S. vaccinates 140 million to 150 million residents against influenza, “but what we’re talking about now is much more intensive,” he said. For Covid-19, the goal is to get vaccines out quickly to all those eligible in a country of 330 million people.

A state-by-state survey would be required to estimate how many total vaccinators are needed nationally, Tan said.

Still, experts are cautiously optimistic that this won’t be a hard problem to fix, pointing to efforts underway to recruit current and retired medical professionals, as well as medical students and nurses in training.

“As long as we continue to see this interest in volunteering, we should have a sufficient workforce to do it,” said Deb Trautman, president and CEO of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Not just anyone can be a vaccinator. One can’t merely walk into a center and offer to help give shots. The training requirements vary by state.

To boost the effort, both the Trump and Biden administrations, using an emergency preparedness law first adopted in 2005, expanded liability protections.

There are clinical skills and preparedness that is required.

With the recent expansions, those qualifying include pharmacy interns and recently retired doctors and nurses, as well as physicians, nurses and pharmacists. The government estimates there are about half a million inactive physicians and 350,000 inactive registered nurses and practical nurses in the United States.

States are also greenlighting dentists, paramedics and other first responders, said Kim Martin, director of immunization policy at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Some are also turning to nursing and medical schools, where faculty and students are often eager to participate. More than 300 schools nationally have signed a pledge offering to help administer the vaccine, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

The University of Houston College of Nursing, for example, altered its curriculum specifically to prepare students for administering covid vaccines — and teams of students and faculty have helped at community vaccination sites.

Others are joining the effort.

The Medical Reserve Corps, a national network of volunteer groups, has more than 200 units in about 40 states, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands assisting with various vaccination efforts, including administering the shots, according to a Health and Human Services spokesperson.

And the military is pitching in, too, with the Pentagon approving the use of more than 1,000 active-duty service members to help the Federal Emergency Management Agency with mass vaccinations sites, the first one set for California.

Although some of these groups give ballpark figures of volunteers, it’s hard to tally just how many have stepped forward in recent months to help vaccinate.

Becoming a Vaccinator

“It should not be left to just anyone that is willing, as there are clinical skills and preparedness that is required,” said Katie Boston-Leary, director of nursing programs at the American Nurses Association.

Even those skilled in giving shots may need a training booster in the war against covid.

When she volunteered, Boston-Leary said, she was required to complete four to six hours of online training across a wide range of topics, from the optimal way to administer intramuscular injections, to specific information about the two vaccines now on the market.

“Even a nurse like me has to go through that training,” said Boston-Leary.

To aid states in setting up training, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered recommendations that all health care staff members receive training in Covid-19 vaccination “even if they are already administering routinely recommended vaccines.”

The CDC has different training modules, based on experience level. For instance, there’s a module for those who have given vaccinations in the previous year, but a different one for those who haven’t done so for more than a year. The time required to complete programs varies — people with the most recent experience require less total training time.

Tan said training laypeople with no medical background to give vaccines “is not the way to go.”

Instead, such volunteers can be used to help with logistics, such as directing people to the right areas, managing traffic, moving supplies around and similar duties.

Training programs exist even for people who aren’t vaccinators but assist with storing, handling or transporting the vaccines. That’s important because the two vaccines currently in use — one from Pfizer-BioNTech and one from Moderna — have different storage requirements.

They are shipped in multidose vials, which is not unusual for vaccines. The vaccinators themselves often draw up the syringes out of the vials, said Tan.

To avoid slowdowns as patients move through the lines, some vaccination centers have other trained staffers pre-fill individual syringes. Anyone doing this task should be “someone trained in administering vaccines as well,” said Tan.

At the clinic where Katie Croft-Walsh, 65, volunteered recently in San Antonio, her only job was to administer the vaccine. Other volunteers took care of registering patients, pre-filling the individual syringes and other logistical efforts.

She decided to volunteer after hearing that help was needed. The move came with a bonus: She would get the vaccine herself at the end of her first day participating, something she already qualified for based on her age but had been unable to secure.

A practicing lawyer, Croft-Walsh previously worked as a registered nurse and kept her license current by taking required courses each year since leaving her hospital job in 1998.

Training occurred on her first day at the mass vaccination site and covered details about each type of vaccine, along with the types of syringes available, the right place to inject the dose and other information. Her group, which she said included nurses, dentists, pharmacists and upper-level nursing students, were trained and overseen by health department physicians.

The patients were all thrilled to get a dose.

“Everyone was very kind and nice,” even if they had to wait a bit in line, she said.

She liked the experience so much that she has volunteered at more clinics — and plans to start volunteering with fire departments as they begin community clinics in her city.

“It made me remember why I went into nursing in the first place,” said Croft-Walsh.

Remember, no squeezing!

To ensure safety, training is important, Martin of the state health officers group said. It’s not that hard to give an intramuscular injection, but you need to place it in the right spot. For adults, that area is in the deltoid muscle, “not too far up the shoulder, not too far down,” she said, both to avoid injury and to make sure the vaccine goes into the muscle.

If they’re concerned their arm is being squeezed, speak up.

Training videos show vaccinators how to find the ideal location, first locating the bony point in the shoulder, then measuring two or three finger widths down and placing the needle in the middle of the arm.

Administering an intramuscular vaccine too high on the shoulder can cause a rare and painful injury. Such injuries were more common years ago when influenza vaccines were first rolling out, said Tan of the immunization coalition. Training on proper technique helped reduce cases since then, he said, and is also part of current efforts to train vaccinators.

It’s also important not to pinch patients’ arms when administering the vaccine, said Tan, responding to a question about a hashtag making the rounds on Twitter called #DoNotSqueezeMyArm.

For intramuscular injections to be most effective, the needle needs to penetrate the muscle, not fat.

“When you squeeze the arm, it pushes up the fat layers,” said Tan.

Those getting the vaccines, he said, can play a role, too.

“I encourage patients to ask questions,” said Tan. “If they’re concerned their arm is being squeezed, speak up. Not in a hostile manner, but say something like, ‘Hey, I read this thing about not squeezing arms. Can you explain why you’re squeezing mine?’”",MSNBC,"['states', 'giving', 'health', 'scramble', 'medical', 'training', 'help', 'tan', 'vaccines', 'nurses', 'vaccine', 'vaccinators', 'covid', 'vaccination']",0

2021-02-21 00:14:02+00:00,57,"DETROIT — While most Covid-19 vaccination clinics around the country are focused primarily on first responders, essential workers and seniors, the city of Detroit is now offering shots to residents who haven’t made vaccination priority lists almost anywhere else in the country.

Among them: Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, vision or hearing impairments, and other intellectual and developmental disabilities.

“I was surprised to see that and very happy,” said Bonnielin Swenor, an epidemiologist and the director of the Disability Health Research Center at Johns Hopkins University. “It means people in the disability community were listened to, were considered, and prioritization was revised in a way that is really remarkable.”

The city’s move will lead to more equity and access for people with disabilities that Swenor hopes other communities will emulate. “It has the potential to spark a really important change,” she said.

At the same time, the decision to prioritize people with conditions that aren’t necessarily known to increase the risk of dying from Covid-19 points to the difficult and delicate choices facing local and state policymakers in a country where vaccination criteria differ considerably from one community to the next.

In much of the country, two people with the same job, who are the same age and are in similar health, could face radically different odds of accessing the shots depending on where they live, where they get medical treatment and the political landscape in their state.

And within communities like Detroit, where people in their 20s with ADHD can now get vaccinated ahead of people in their 50s with chronic heart or lung conditions, it can lead to difficult questions about whose health should come first.

“These are the judgments that we are making every step of the way,” Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said during a news conference Wednesday as he announced that Detroiters 60 and older with serious physical health conditions could get vaccinated.

Some of the disabilities the city added earlier have been linked to higher risks of dying from Covid-19. Others, such as autism and ADHD, make it difficult to socially distance and wear a mask.

“When everybody in a particular category has had a chance to get a vaccine, we go to the next category,” Duggan said of a city effort to vaccinate 15,000 people a week using an eligibility list that now includes teachers, waiters, grocery clerks, clergy members, postal workers and the homeless. “We went to what we believe to be the next highest risk category.”

‘Overwhelming’ need

The push to prioritize people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Detroit came from advocates who flooded the mayor’s office with letters and blitzed local media to call attention to the extra challenges people with disabilities face as they try to avoid infection or get treated for Covid-19.

“People with disabilities are being left out of Covid vaccine rollouts and being left out of data collection when somebody contracts Covid, and that leads to disparities,” said Dessa Cosma, the executive director of Detroit Disability Power, a social justice organization that led the letter-writing campaign.

When Cosma heard that Duggan planned to announce, on Feb. 11, that adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities, along with their caregivers, would be added to the city’s vaccination list, she thought perhaps the mayor would narrow eligibility to people with conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Those disorders have been more conclusively linked to higher Covid-19 rates or deaths.

Instead, she was thrilled — and proud — to see that Duggan went broad, including all intellectual and developmental disabilities and specifically naming six conditions, in addition to Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Among them were autism, Tourette syndrome, hearing and vision impairment, and ADHD, a neurological condition that affects nearly 5 percent of U.S. adults, causing impulsivity, hyperactivity and difficulty focusing.

Since everyone’s condition is unique, Cosma said, a broad definition is crucial to prevent “some very marginalized people from falling through the cracks.”

That broad definition sets Detroit apart.

Many states have adopted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines recommending that people with Down syndrome be prioritized, and others have prioritized people with developmental and intellectual disabilities who live in group homes. But just a handful of states, including New York, Delaware, Missouri and New Mexico, list people with disabilities among those eligible for a vaccination before the general public.

Among those states, none explicitly include ADHD or visual and hearing impairments among qualifying conditions, though people can make a case with a doctor’s note if they believe they should be eligible.

Even Michigan doesn’t include intellectual or developmental disabilities other than Down syndrome among its vaccination priorities. Detroit was able to include disabled residents because local communities “have the option to prioritize the groups within the guidance they feel are most at risk and at highest need of vaccination,” Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said in an email.

When Duggan made the disability announcement last week, he touted the “overwhelming” need to reach people with conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus. A spokesman said the city drew its list of diagnoses from the CDC’s definitions of developmental and intellectual disabilities.

‘Trying to get in the line’

Advocates for people with disabilities who have been pushing for vaccine priority across the country applauded Detroit’s decision, especially given the many ways that residents here are struggling.

In a city where nearly 90 percent of residents are Black or Latino and where 35 percent live in poverty, people with disabilities face multiple layers of discrimination and barriers to health care that put them at higher risk for Covid-19, said Justice Shorter, the disaster protection adviser for the National Disability Rights Network.

Detroit has been hit hard by the pandemic, tallying more than 1,800 deaths, including Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, state Rep. Isaac Robinson and a long list of community leaders.

Some of the disabilities on the city’s list might seem surprising to people not living with those conditions, Shorter, who is blind, said.

“In medical terms, blindness itself might not be considered something that would put you at a heightened risk for Covid,” she said, unless you consider that people with visual impairments rely on others to drive them around or point out hazards, and can’t see whether someone offering to help is wearing a mask.

“You have to consider the ways in which you maneuver through society,” she said.

As for ADHD, advocates note that people with the disorder might not realize they’re too close to others. They might impulsively touch people or things and might get distracted and forget to wash their hands or wear a mask — all behaviors that would put them at higher risk for coronavirus infection.

They also might behave in ways that put off doctors or nurses and affect their ability to get quality health care.

“They may be perceived as difficult to work with, so providers may choose to refer them out or may not be adequately trained to address patients’ needs,” said Emily Hotez, an assistant professor in developmental psychology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who wrote a commentary calling for people with ADHD, autism and other disabilities to get vaccination priority.

While there has been some research on disabilities and Covid-19, advocates say more is needed. They note that disabilities are often left out of statistics that tally virus or death rates by age, race and location.

Not much is known about how ADHD in particular affects Covid-19 outcomes beyond a study last year that found that people with the disorder are more likely to contract the virus, Hotez said. Another study found that people with ADHD who contract the virus are less likely to die from it than others.

Some people with ADHD say they do not consider themselves developmentally disabled and questioned whether their condition should get priority.

“I would make sure that other people who could benefit from it more would get it first,” said David Penalver, 20, an aerospace engineering student at North Carolina State University who was diagnosed with ADHD last year.

But when told that a reason advocates believe people with ADHD should get priority is because of behaviors associated with higher coronavirus infections, Penalver reconsidered.

“That’s a good point,” he said. “I happen to have my hands on my face right now. I didn’t even think about that but, certainly, I’m touching handrails and surfaces going up and down stairs. I have a tendency to fidget. I touch my face. I bite my nails.”

Penalver isn’t alone in not immediately considering the ways that neurological and physical differences put people at risk, both during a pandemic and at other times, said Swenor, the epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins University.

“I hope more of that starts to happen even beyond Covid,” she said.

Cosma, from Detroit Disability Power, said her organization has turned its attention to getting intellectual and developmental disabilities added to vaccination priority lists in the rest of Michigan. She is also in contact with advocates who are making similar demands in other states.

2021-02-20 23:44:02+00:00,45,"WASHINGTON — Add Mother Nature to the pile of crises on President Joe Biden's plate.

A month into the job and focused on the coronavirus, Biden is seeing his disaster management skills tested after winter storms plunged Texas, Oklahoma and neighboring states into an unusual deep freeze that left millions shivering in homes that lost heat and power, and in many homes, water.

At least 59 deaths across the U.S. have been blamed on the blast of unseasonable weather.

Biden came into office Jan. 20 promising to tackle a series of brewing crises, starting with the coronavirus pandemic and its ripple effects on the economy. He tacked on systemic racism and climate change as top priorities. And now he's contending with storms that have not only imperiled Americans but also delayed the shipment and administration of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines.

Biden said Friday that he hopes to travel to Texas next week but doesn't want his presence and the accompanying presidential entourage to distract from the recovery.

“They're working like the devil to take care of their folks,” Biden said of Texas officials. He said he'd make a decision early next week about travel.

Biden, who offered himself during the campaign as the experienced and empathetic candidate the nation needed at this moment in time, is working on several fronts to address the situation — and to avoid repeating the mistakes of predecessors who got tripped up by inadequate or insensitive responses in times of disaster.

Part of the job of being president is responding to the destruction left behind by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters, or events like deadly mass shootings, or even acts of terrorism.

Some have handled such situations better than others.

George W. Bush earned praised for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but stumbled during his administration’s halting response to the humanitarian disaster that unfolded in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast four years later.

Barack Obama said he should have anticipated the blowback he got for going to the golf course right after he condemned the beheading of a kidnapped American journalist by Islamist militants in 2014. Obama was vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard at the time.

Donald Trump was criticized for tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of people in Puerto Rico who had endured Hurricane Maria’s pummeling of the island in 2017. He defended tossing the towels, saying the people were “having fun.”

Bill Clinton, who famously claimed during the 1992 presidential campaign that “I feel your pain,” was a natural at connecting with disaster victims.

Just this week, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas showed how quickly one bad move during a crisis can become a public relations disaster for a politician.

Cruz came under attack for traveling to Mexico while his constituents suffered without power, heat and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned. Cruz later said the trip was a mistake.

Biden has tweeted about Texas and the other affected states, while the White House has issued numerous statements aimed at demonstrating that the federal government is in command of the situation.

The president is getting regular updates from his staff and has declared states of emergency in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. He said Friday that he will soon declare a major disaster in the state of Texas and that he has asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to address the suffering.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency also has shipped dozens of generators and supplies, including fuel, water, blankets and ready-to-eat meals, to the affected areas.

Biden has spoken to the governors of the seven states most affected by the winter weather. He tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.

Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch supporter of Trump's, was quick to praise Biden for swift action on a disaster declaration.

After speaking with Biden by telephone earlier this week, Stitt specifically thanked the president for “taking the time to reach out this afternoon and offer the federal government’s help for Oklahomans. We had a very productive call and I look forward to working together to find solutions as we recover from this historic storm.”

Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said Biden is “well-suited"" to deal with the disaster because of his decades of service in the U.S. Senate and as a former vice president and because of “his genuine concern for people.”

“He's got to show empathy right off the bat,” Perry said in an interview. “It's important for a president to go to a place that’s been battered, but be careful about the footprint. He doesn’t want to make things worse.”

Biden, should he decide to visit Texas next week, could also use the trip to press his point that climate change is real and must not go unaddressed, and that the state could do things like winterize its power plants to be better prepared for future storms, Perry said.

But he should take care to not do so in a scolding kind of way.

“We know he cares about climate change, and this is a way to convince people,” Perry said.",MSNBC,"['disaster', 'management', 'states', 'testing', 'president', 'perry', 'biden', 'storms', 'federal', 'texas', 'extreme', 'bidens', 'weather', 'skills', 'week', 'working']",0
2021-02-20 15:02:03+00:00,677,"Florida’s governor was slow to respond to the pandemic and his Covid-19 vaccine distribution plan has been marked by chaos, but critics say he’s been quick to recognize the political gold in those precious doses.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ignored federal guidelines and prioritized getting senior citizens — one of Florida’s most potent voting blocs — vaccinated first.

When Holocaust survivors and Cuban survivors of the Bay of Pigs debacle — revered members of two other key Florida voting blocs — got their first shots, DeSantis made sure he was there for the news conferences.

And now the governor stands accused of using the Covid-19 vaccine to reward powerful political supporters and developers by setting up pop-up vaccination sites in planned communities they developed and where GOP voters predominate.

Responding to recent criticism from both Republican and Democrats in Manatee and Charlotte counties, both south of Tampa, where one site was set up last week and another began dispensing doses on Wednesday, DeSantis said local lawmakers should be more grateful

“I’ll tell you what, I wouldn’t be complaining,” the governor said. “I’d be thankful that we are able to do it.”

DeSantis said that his ""seniors first strategy"" zeroes in on retirement communities that are willing to help organize vaccination events and that Manatee County has trailed other parts of the state in getting needles into the arms of residents ages 65 and older.

The governor said the state had set up similar sites at the Kings Point community in Palm Beach County, Sun City Center in Hillsborough County, and The Villages retirement community northwest of Orlando.

“If Manatee County doesn’t like us doing this, we are totally fine with putting this in counties that want it,” he said.

There was no response from the DeSantis administration when NBC News reached out for comment, but on Thursday the governor was in Largo in Pinellas County at another hurriedly arranged pop-up vaccination operation.

There DeSantis boasted about vaccinating the 2 millionth senior citizen in Florida, a 94-year-old Korean war veteran named Vern Cummings whose vaccination was broadcast live on FOX News.

Earlier, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a South Florida Democrat, blasted DeSantis for threatening Manatee County.

“To threaten that he would pull vaccine if people don’t like the way the distribution system is working is vile and shows the callous indifference he has had in how the vaccine has been handled,” she said on Wednesday.

But there is little to stop DeSantis from distributing the vaccines any way he wants.

In December, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released recommendations on who should be getting vaccinated first. But the Trump administration essentially left the distribution of the doses up to governors, said Philip J. Palin, a veteran government consultant who specializes in delivering supplies to survivors of catastrophes.

This allowed DeSantis to put senior citizens in the same category as front-line health care workers, and the result was chaos when some counties began offering shots on a first-come, first-served basis.

In Charlotte County, officials said they were caught unaware when a vaccination station suddenly opened last week in the Kings Gate retirement community in Port Charlotte and 3,000 doses were dispensed.

Harvey Goldstein, who sits on the county’s GOP executive committee and does not live in the development, said he first learned of the pop-up when a regular Republican Party meeting was canceled so that some of the members could get their shots.

“It looks like they were allowed to jump the line ahead of the 90,000 people in the county who are still waiting to get a shot,” Goldstein, 81, told NBC News.

“If you set up rules about who should get vaccinated first they should apply to everyone. I haven’t heard any rationale for them to get their shots ahead of the people who registered in the county.”

Goldstein said he suspects the reason Kings Gate got special treatment is because it was built by Benderson Development and “they swing a heavy hammer in Tallahassee.” NBC News has reached out to the company's marketing director, Julie Fanning, but there was no immediate response.

Charlotte County Democratic Party Chair Teresa Jenkins said DeSantis’ decision to open a vaccination center in Kings Gate created the appearance that “politically connected people who are likely to vote for the governor are getting prioritized.”

“There’s quite a bit of anger out there,” Jenkins told NBC News. “So many of us get online every morning trying to get a vaccination appointment. We have people who are waiting and waiting and waiting for their shots. And here we see vaccinations being distributed in areas where there are mostly political supporters of Gov. DeSantis.”

Of the 1,900 residents of Kings Gate, Jenkins said, only 150 are registered Democrats.

“That says something,” said Jenkins. “And we’re very angry about it.”

Some of that anger was on display Tuesday at a meeting of the Manatee County Commission, where many attendees first learned that 3,000 doses were being delivered Wednesday to another pop-up vaccination station in Lakewood Ranch, a wealthy development that straddles the Manatee and Sarasota county border.

“For the life of me, I can’t understand why we would vaccinate the most affluent neighborhoods in the county ahead of everyone else, especially the underserved neighborhoods and large number of manufactured home parks in our community,” Manatee County Commissioner Misty Servia, a Republican, wrote in a text message to The Bradenton Herald.

Lakewood Ranch’s parent company, Schroeder-Manatee Ranch, is owned by the Illinois-based Uihlein family, members of which have given millions to the Republican Party.

“The state [Gov. DeSantis] called our CEO and asked to hold a pop-up clinic in Lakewood Ranch,” Schroeder-Manatee Ranch spokeswoman Lisa Barnott wrote in an email to The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. “We connected them with our county commissioner, who coordinated the use of the county-owned Premier Sports Campus.”

The commissioner in question was Manatee County Commission Chairwoman Vanessa Baugh, a Republican who is close to DeSantis and who defended the decision at the public meeting Tuesday.

“It’s a good thing, not a bad thing,” Baugh said. “Did I even stop to think that this board and others would be so upset about it? No, to be honest, I didn’t. I think it was a great idea.”

Shortly after NBC News reached out to Baugh for elaboration, her spokesman sent a statement from the commissioner which read, in part:

”I fully support the Governor, his Covid-19 response and his team’s decision to vaccinate a group of seniors who have a below state average for receiving vaccinations,” it said.

Baugh closed by thanking DeSantis “for standing strong in the face of so much media criticism.”

“Florida has stayed open, kept families employed and still managed the pandemic better than most any other state,” she wrote.

Florida, according to the latest NBC News tally, has reported 1.84 million Covid-19 infections and nearly 30,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, some of the worst numbers in the nation.

Most of those infections and deaths came after DeSantis, a staunch Trump supporter, claimed victory over the virus during a White House visit in April and reopened the state over the objections of health experts.

2021-02-20 00:25:04+00:00,39,"The Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech produces a robust immune response after just one dose, according to a new Israeli study of vaccinated health care workers at the country's largest hospital.

The research, published Thursday in the medical journal The Lancet, followed 7,214 staff members at Israel's Sheba Medical Center, a government-owned facility, who received their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination between Dec. 19 and Jan. 24. Scientists from the medical center found that the vaccine was 85 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 within 15 to 28 days after the shot was administered.

Experts cautioned that more research is needed before broad conclusions can be drawn, but the results do provide some evidence that robust immunity is generated after one dose and that the second dose could be delayed beyond the three weeks prescribed by Pfizer in order to ease distribution and supply constraints.

The timing of the second dose has been the subject of much recent debate, with some countries such as the United Kingdom opting to delay it as a way to speed up the country's rate of immunization. In the United States, where the vaccine rollout has been bumpy and winter storms over the past week have hampered some states' ability to administer shots, similar questions have emerged.

Dr. Jonathan Temte, a vaccine expert at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health who was not involved with the Israeli study, said any sweeping changes to immunization recommendations would require more data, but that the results of the new study are encouraging.

""It does provide reassurance that delays for whatever reason, be it the weather or problems in the supply chain — it provides some comfort knowing that those individuals who have received the one dose do achieve a good level of protection,"" he said.

Official guidance from the Food and Drug Administration and Pfizer-BioNTech state that the two doses should be administered 21 days apart based on the results of clinical trials. For the Moderna vaccine, the only other vaccine currently authorized for use in the U.S., the prescribed interval between the two shots is 28 days.

But vaccine supplies are limited and different strains of the virus are circulating around the country, putting pressure on states to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible. Some have questioned whether there is flexibility in the timing of the second dose.

Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance to say that the second shot should be administered within the prescribed time frames where possible, but that the second dose of the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines could be delayed up to six weeks, if necessary.

Pfizer has said it has not yet studied changes to the timing between doses, and the drugmaker has maintained that any deviations to the dosing schedule is up to health authorities.

In the new Israeli study, researchers reported 170 Covid-19 infections among health care workers at the Sheba Medical Center between Dec. 19 and Jan. 24. Of those, 78 people tested positive after receiving the first dose and three individuals tested positive after receiving the second dose. Since the vaccines are not 100 percent effective, it is expected that a small number of people could contract the virus even after being fully vaccinated.

The study also found a 75 percent reduction in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections after just the first shot. The scientists said these reductions suggest that one dose provides a robust enough immune response to justify delaying the second shot.

""Early reductions of Covid-19 rates provide support of delaying the second dose in countries facing vaccine shortages and scarce resources, so as to allow higher population coverage with a single dose,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

They acknowledged, though, that testing limitations may have resulted in undercounted asymptomatic cases and that follow-up research is needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of a single dose.

The findings provide some of the first real-world data on the effectiveness of a single vaccine dose. Israel's vaccination program has far outpaced any other country, and more than 30 percent of the country's 9 million residents have already received both doses.

Temte said that while early results from Israel's vaccine program are positive, there are still too many unknowns about a single dose's efficacy beyond three to six weeks.

""Until such time that there are good clinical trials that show that a single dose provides an equivalent level of protection, I don't know that we should abandon our approach or create new policies,"" he said.

It's also not clear how one dose will perform against different coronavirus strains that are becoming more widespread, including separate strains that were first reported in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil.

""We're running into uncharted territory,"" said Deepta Bhattacharya, an associate professor of immunobiology at the University of Arizona, who was not involved with the study. ""The uncertain issue is how long that protection is going to last against the current variants, as well as some of the ones that might get selected for if you wait too long.""

Bhattacharya said delaying the second dose up to six weeks, in line with the CDC's guidance, seems reasonable. But beyond that, it may be too soon to tell, which means health officials may be faced with tricky decisions.

""We're stretching the limits of what we're able to see,"" he said. ""We’re sort of at a point now where we have to make decisions based on imperfect evidence.""",MSNBC,"['finds', 'results', 'covid19', 'provide', 'health', 'study', 'offer', 'israeli', 'dose', 'medical', 'pfizer', 'second', 'strong', 'vaccine', 'single', 'protection']",0
2021-02-20 00:02:06+00:00,52,"The two Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States have reassuring safety profiles with no concerning new issues found in data collected from the first month of vaccinations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

After administration of 13.8 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to the U.S. population, most reports indicated non-serious side effects of the type that had been expected, such as headaches and fatigue. No deaths have been attributed to the vaccines, the data showed.

The CDC collected data between Dec. 14, 2020 and Jan. 13, 2021 from both an existing national surveillance system for adverse events and its own safety monitoring system established for Covid-19 vaccines.

During that time, 6,994 reports of adverse events after vaccination were recorded in the national surveillance system with 90.8 percent of them classified as non-serious and 9.2 percent as serious.

Rare cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction requiring medical attention, were reported with both vaccines at a rate of 4.5 cases per million doses administered, down from the agency's previously reported rate of 5 per million doses administered. The rate of anaphylaxis linked to Covid shots is similar to other vaccines, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday during the White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing.

""Healthcare providers and vaccine recipients can be reassured about the safety of Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

2021-02-19 10:02:04+00:00,650,"Florida’s governor was slow to respond to the pandemic and his Covid-19 vaccine distribution plan has been marked by chaos, but critics say he’s been quick to recognize the political gold in those precious doses.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, ignored federal guidelines and prioritized getting senior citizens — one of Florida’s most potent voting blocs — vaccinated first.

When Holocaust survivors and Cuban survivors of the Bay of Pigs debacle — revered members of two other key Florida voting blocs — got their first shots, DeSantis made sure he was there for the news conferences.

And now the governor stands accused of using the Covid-19 vaccine to reward powerful political supporters and developers by setting up pop-up vaccination sites in planned communities they developed and where GOP voters predominate.

Responding to recent criticism from both Republican and Democrats in Manatee and Charlotte counties, both south of Tampa, where one site was set up last week and another began dispensing doses on Wednesday, DeSantis said local lawmakers should be more grateful

“I’ll tell you what, I wouldn’t be complaining,” the governor said. “I’d be thankful that we are able to do it.”

DeSantis said that his ""seniors first strategy"" zeroes in on retirement communities that are willing to help organize vaccination events and that Manatee County has trailed other parts of the state in getting needles into the arms of residents ages 65 and older.

The governor said the state had set up similar sites at the Kings Point community in Palm Beach County, Sun City Center in Hillsborough County, and The Villages retirement community northwest of Orlando.

“If Manatee County doesn’t like us doing this, we are totally fine with putting this in counties that want it,” he said.

There was no response from the DeSantis administration when NBC News reached out for comment, but on Thursday the governor was in Largo in Pinellas County at another hurriedly arranged pop-up vaccination operation.

There DeSantis boasted about vaccinating the 2 millionth senior citizen in Florida, a 94-year-old Korean war veteran named Vern Cummings whose vaccination was broadcast live on FOX News.

Earlier, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a South Florida Democrat, blasted DeSantis for threatening Manatee County.

“To threaten that he would pull vaccine if people don’t like the way the distribution system is working is vile and shows the callous indifference he has had in how the vaccine has been handled,” she said on Wednesday.

But there is little to stop DeSantis from distributing the vaccines any way he wants.

In December, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released recommendations on who should be getting vaccinated first. But the Trump administration essentially left the distribution of the doses up to governors, said Philip J. Palin, a veteran government consultant who specializes in delivering supplies to survivors of catastrophes.

This allowed DeSantis to put senior citizens in the same category as front-line health care workers, and the result was chaos when some counties began offering shots on a first-come, first-served basis.

In Charlotte County, officials said they were caught unaware when a vaccination station suddenly opened last week in the Kings Gate retirement community in Port Charlotte and 3,000 doses were dispensed.

Harvey Goldstein, who sits on the county’s GOP executive committee and does not live in the development, said he first learned of the pop-up when a regular Republican Party meeting was canceled so that some of the members could get their shots.

“It looks like they were allowed to jump the line ahead of the 90,000 people in the county who are still waiting to get a shot,” Goldstein, 81, told NBC News.

“If you set up rules about who should get vaccinated first they should apply to everyone. I haven’t heard any rationale for them to get their shots ahead of the people who registered in the county.”

Goldstein said he suspects the reason Kings Gate got special treatment is because it was built by Benderson Development and “they swing a heavy hammer in Tallahassee.” NBC News has reached out to the company's marketing director, Julie Fanning, but there was no immediate response.

Charlotte County Democratic Party Chair Teresa Jenkins said DeSantis’ decision to open a vaccination center in Kings Gate created the appearance that “politically connected people who are likely to vote for the governor are getting prioritized.”

“There’s quite a bit of anger out there,” Jenkins told NBC News. “So many of us get online every morning trying to get a vaccination appointment. We have people who are waiting and waiting and waiting for their shots. And here we see vaccinations being distributed in areas where there are mostly political supporters of Gov. DeSantis.”

Of the 1,900 residents of Kings Gate, Jenkins said, only 150 are registered Democrats.

“That says something,” said Jenkins. “And we’re very angry about it.”

Some of that anger was on display Tuesday at a meeting of the Manatee County Commission, where many attendees first learned that 3,000 doses were being delivered Wednesday to another pop-up vaccination station in Lakewood Ranch, a wealthy development that straddles the Manatee and Sarasota county border.

“For the life of me, I can’t understand why we would vaccinate the most affluent neighborhoods in the county ahead of everyone else, especially the underserved neighborhoods and large number of manufactured home parks in our community,” Manatee County Commissioner Misty Servia, a Republican, wrote in a text message to The Bradenton Herald.

Lakewood Ranch’s parent company, Schroeder-Manatee Ranch, is owned by the Illinois-based Uihlein family, members of which have given millions to the Republican Party.

“The state [Gov. DeSantis] called our CEO and asked to hold a pop-up clinic in Lakewood Ranch,” Schroeder-Manatee Ranch spokeswoman Lisa Barnott wrote in an email to The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. “We connected them with our county commissioner, who coordinated the use of the county-owned Premier Sports Campus.”

The commissioner in question was Manatee County Commission Chairwoman Vanessa Baugh, a Republican who is close to DeSantis and who defended the decision at the public meeting Tuesday.

“It’s a good thing, not a bad thing,” Baugh said. “Did I even stop to think that this board and others would be so upset about it? No, to be honest, I didn’t. I think it was a great idea.”

Shortly after NBC News reached out to Baugh for elaboration, her spokesman sent a statement from the commissioner which read, in part:

”I fully support the Governor, his Covid-19 response and his team’s decision to vaccinate a group of seniors who have a below state average for receiving vaccinations,” it said.

Baugh closed by thanking DeSantis “for standing strong in the face of so much media criticism.”

“Florida has stayed open, kept families employed and still managed the pandemic better than most any other state,” she wrote.

Florida, according to the latest NBC News tally, has reported 1.84 million Covid-19 infections and nearly 30,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, some of the worst numbers in the nation.

Most of those infections and deaths came after DeSantis, a staunch Trump supporter, claimed victory over the virus during a White House visit in April and reopened the state over the objections of health experts.

2021-02-18 23:06:03+00:00,72,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will announce plans to contribute up to $4 billion to a global Covid-19 vaccine program aimed at assisting developing countries, a move officials argue will bolster American national security interests by helping control the pandemic globally.

The United States will contribute an initial $2 billion in the coming days to a World Health Organization-backed program called COVAX that supports access to vaccines for 92 countries. The remaining $2 billion will be contributed over the next two years, including another $500 million when other donor pledges are fulfilled and initial doses are delivered.

While millions of Americans are still waiting to get access to the vaccine, administration officials said that contributing the funds, which were specifically appropriated by Congress in December for foreign pandemic assistance, will help Americans by reducing the risk of further mutations that could extend the pandemic.

“We do think that it is vital to take a role in beating the pandemic globally and to really put U.S. leadership out there to do this,” a senior administration official said. “It's critically important to surge vaccination globally, while we'll of course prioritizing vaccinations here at home.”

The move highlights Biden's different approach to global affairs after former President Donald Trump withdrew from the WHO and signed an executive order prioritizing vaccines for Americans before helping other countries. Still, senior administration officials said the U.S. will only consider donating vaccines to lower-income countries once enough supply has been secured to vaccinate all Americans, contrary to what some global health organizations requested.

The global aid organization UNICEF has said countries that have vaccinated their own health workers and populations at highest risk of severe disease should share vaccine doses with other countries so they can do the same. Nearly 130 countries, with 2.5 billion people, have yet to administer a single dose, the group said Feb. 10, which UNICEF called a “self-defeating strategy” that will give further opportunity for the virus to mutate.

It is also unclear how much the funding will help in the short-term. Some global health officials have complained that funding isn't the issue when it comes to getting the vaccine quickly to developing countries because there isn't enough vaccine to buy, a problem the U.S. has contributed to by snatching up hundreds of millions of doses for Americans.

After early praise for his leadership when his state became the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, the governor is now dealing with accusations of underreporting nursing home deaths.

In recent weeks, the administration revealed that 15,000 long-term care residents have died, up from the 8,500 previously disclosed.

Spokespeople for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn and the FBI declined to comment Wednesday night.

The Albany Times Union first reported news of the inquiry.

“As we publicly said, DOJ has been looking into this for months. We have been cooperating with them and we will continue to,"" a senior advisor for the governor, Rich Azzopardi, said Wednesday night.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Last month, state Attorney General Letitia James released a damning report that said the state Health Department underreported the Covid-19 death toll at nursing homes by as much as 50 percent.

And last week, Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo’s top aide, said that the state held off on releasing the fuller death count in August because of fears that President Donald Trump would use the information against Cuomo.

People familiar with the matter say it was shortly after DeRosa’s private comments to state lawmakers became public that federal investigators started asking questions.

Current and former law enforcement officials say investigators are in the very early stages of their probe and the possible investigative avenues could include false statements, any scheme to defraud the federal government of funds or any misuse of federal funds.

""There are other investigative avenues but these make sense based on what little we know at this point,"" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former federal prosecutor and NBC News legal analyst.

On Monday, the governor acknowledged that ""things should have been done differently"" and insisted that ""lessons were learned.""

""In retrospect, should we have given more priority to fulfilling information requests? In my opinion, yes. And that's what created the void,"" Cuomo said. ""I just want to make sure people know these are the facts: Everything that could have been done was done.""

Democratic and Republican lawmakers in New York are now reported to be reconsidering their decision to grant Cuomo emergency powers to contend with the Covid-19 crisis.

New York was hit hard in the early days of the pandemic, and until recently the state led the country in Covid-19 deaths. It had recorded 47,301 as of Wednesday, second only to California's 47,670 deaths, according to the most recent NBC News data.

Most of New York's deaths came in the early days of the pandemic, when public health officials were trying to figure out how the coronavirus was spreading.

The U.S. Eastern District is likely handing this investigation in part because U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss for the Southern District is the mother-in-law of Cuomo’s aide DeRosa and would have to recuse herself and office.

2021-02-18 09:04:04+00:00,26,"ALBANY, N.Y. — A Democratic lawmaker says New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo vowed to “destroy” him during a private phone call last week for criticizing his handling of Covid-19 outbreaks at nursing homes.

Cuomo, who has long had a reputation for playing rough in politics, denied the allegation Wednesday, and fired back by calling the Assembly member a chronic liar.

The governor used a call with reporters to blast Assemblyman Ron Kim, of Queens, one of nine Democrats who signed a letter seeking support for a bill that would revoke the governor’s emergency powers related to the pandemic, which are set to expire this spring.

The letter, sent to Assembly members Tuesday, said Cuomo’s administration “deliberately covered up” the extent of the pandemic’s impact on nursing homes and assisted living facilities by publishing an incomplete accounting of the number of deaths, despite requests from lawmakers, reporters and the U.S. Department of Justice.

In recent weeks, the administration revealed that 15,000 long-term care residents have died, up from the 8,500 previously disclosed.

″(I)t is now unambiguously clear that this governor has engaged in an intentional obstruction of justice,” the letter said.

Cuomo said it’s a “lie” that he obstructed justice, and told reporters Wednesday that he had a “long hostile relationship” with Kim. The governor also accused Kim of being “unethical” for backing nail salon owners as lawmakers discussed safety and wage reforms of the industry in 2015. Kim had initially supported the reforms, but later opposed some of them after getting support from salon owners.

“I didn’t say anything about Assemblyman Ron Kim. He attacked me,” Cuomo said. “He attacked me and said that I obstructed justice in a letter.”

Kim told The New York Times and CNN on Wednesday that Cuomo called him on the phone Feb. 11 to shout at him about his comments on the nursing home issue.

“He goes off about how I hadn’t seen his wrath and anger, that he would destroy me and he would go out tomorrow and start telling how bad of a person I am and I would be finished and how he had bit his tongue about me for months,” Kim told The New York Times. “This was all yelling. It wasn’t a pleasant tone.”

Cuomo’s senior advisor, Rich Azzopardi, accused Kim of lying in a statement Wednesday.

“At no time did anyone threaten to ‘destroy’ anyone with their ‘wrath’ nor engage in a ‘coverup,’” wrote Azzopardi, who said he was on the phone call.

Kim has been a frequent critic of the administration on nursing home issues, including its months-long delay in releasing a full count of fatalities.

Cuomo on Monday said the state didn’t cover up deaths, but should have moved faster to release information. “No excuses: I accept responsibility for that,” he said at a news conference.

Last week, Cuomo’s top aide Melissa DeRosa told Democratic lawmakers that the administration took months to release data revealing how many people living at nursing homes died of COVID-19 because officials “froze” over worries the information was “going to be used against us.”

Kim said Wednesday the governor is now trying to distract the public from growing criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike about his administration’s handling and reporting of outbreaks.

2021-02-18 03:03:04+00:00,52,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said it will spend $1.6 billion to expand Covid-19 testing in schools and underserved areas, increase testing supply production and expand genomic sequencing, a move administration officials described as a “bridge” until Congress approves more funding.

The federal government will spend $650 million to expand testing for elementary and middle schools and in places like homeless shelters, said Carole Johnson, the administration’s Covid-19 supply coordinator.

The administration will also set up regional coordinating centers to distribute testing supplies and coordinate with laboratories to collect specimens and perform tests, Johnson said on a conference call with reporters.

The White House will also allocate $815 million to increase manufacturing of testing supplies and raw materials, such as filter pipette tips, nitrocellulose used in certain tests, and specific injected molded plastics needed to house testing reagents, Johnson said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will spend an additional $200 million to identify and track new strains of the virus, increasing the sequencing capacity by threefold.

The White House is seeking $50 billion from Congress to expand testing and track virus mutations and officials said the steps being taken Wednesday were only meant to bridge the gap until that request is approved.

“These resources are significant steps in the short term, they are far from what’s necessary to meet the need for testing,” Johnson said. “They are merely a bridge until Congress passes the American Rescue Plan.""

Officials have said they are increasing the number of vaccine doses being sent to the states by more than 50 percent since taking over. The administration plans to ship 13.5 million doses directly to states this week and 2 million to pharmacy chains, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.

The U.S. is currently averaging 1.7 million shots per day, up from 1.1 million four weeks ago, according to CDC data.

As of Feb. 16, the CDC reported that 39 million first doses were administered and more than 15 million people were fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by NBC News.

After early praise for his leadership when his state became the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, the governor is now dealing with accusations of underreporting nursing home deaths.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Last month, state Attorney General Letitia James released a damning report that said the state Health Department underreported the Covid-19 death toll at nursing homes by as much as 50 percent.

And last week, Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo’s top aide, said that the state held off on releasing the fuller death count in August because of fears that President Donald Trump would use the information against Cuomo.

People familiar with the matter say it was shortly after DeRosa’s private comments to state lawmakers became public that federal investigators started asking questions.

Current and former law enforcement officials say investigators are in the very early stages of their probe and the possible investigative avenues could include false statements, any scheme to defraud the federal government of funds or any misuse of federal funds.

""There are other investigative avenues but these make sense based on what little we know at this point,"" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former federal prosecutor and NBC News legal analyst.

On Monday, the governor acknowledged that ""things should have been done differently"" and insisted that ""lessons were learned.""

""In retrospect, should we have given more priority to fulfilling information requests? In my opinion, yes. And that's what created the void,"" Cuomo said. ""I just want to make sure people know these are the facts: Everything that could have been done was done.""

Democratic and Republican lawmakers in New York are now reported to be reconsidering their decision to grant Cuomo emergency powers to contend with the Covid-19 crisis.

New York was hit hard in the early days of the pandemic, and until recently the state led the country in Covid-19 deaths. It had recorded 47,301 as of Wednesday, second only to California's 47,670 deaths, according to the most recent NBC News data.

Most of New York's deaths came in the early days of the pandemic, when public health officials were trying to figure out how the coronavirus was spreading.

The U.S. Eastern District is likely handing this investigation in part because U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss for the Southern District is the mother-in-law of Cuomo’s aide DeRosa and would have to recuse herself and office.

2021-02-18 00:10:06+00:00,30,"ALBANY, N.Y. — A Democratic lawmaker says New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo vowed to “destroy” him during a private phone call last week for criticizing his handling of Covid-19 outbreaks at nursing homes.

Cuomo, who has long had a reputation for playing rough in politics, denied the allegation Wednesday, and fired back by calling the Assembly member a chronic liar.

The governor used a call with reporters to blast Assemblyman Ron Kim, of Queens, one of nine Democrats who signed a letter seeking support for a bill that would revoke the governor’s emergency powers related to the pandemic, which are set to expire this spring.

The letter, sent to Assembly members Tuesday, said Cuomo’s administration “deliberately covered up” the extent of the pandemic’s impact on nursing homes and assisted living facilities by publishing an incomplete accounting of the number of deaths, despite requests from lawmakers, reporters and the U.S. Department of Justice.

In recent weeks, the administration revealed that 15,000 long-term care residents have died, up from the 8,500 previously disclosed.

“I have been calling to get an appointment anywhere, every morning, every afternoon and often I’ve been online at night,” Goldman said.

2021-02-17 16:46:06+00:00,26,"The extreme winter weather covering much of the U.S. is causing enough disruption to vaccinations that the country may take slightly longer to reach herd immunity against Covid-19, potentially extending the length of the pandemic, experts who are following the vaccination rollout said.

“Any delay now is going to delay the amount of time it takes to get there,” said Bruce Y. Lee, a professor of public health and health policy at the City University of New York.

The full extent of the disruption isn’t yet known, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned late Tuesday that there were likely to be “widespread delays” in vaccine shipments and deliveries over the next few days. The announcement came after states and local municipalities had already canceled many appointments.

The vaccination disruptions are widespread in part because weather has affected major shipping hubs. According to the CDC, shipments have been delayed out of a FedEx facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and a UPS facility in Louisville, Kentucky. They are vaccine shipping hubs for multiple states, the agency said.

Health workers may be able to make up at least some ground once temperatures warm up and electricity is restored to millions of people without power in Texas. In Marion County, Alabama, the health department said on Facebook that it was planning extended clinic hours Thursday and Friday “and into next week as needed” to accommodate people whose vaccine appointments were originally scheduled for early this week.

But experts said it was not a certainty that all agencies could get back on track — and that each day that goes by is invaluable to the vaccination effort.

Lee said that, in the short term, the spread of Covid-19 infections may slow in the hardest-hit states if people stay home and socialize less, but that the severe weather bringing ice and low temperatures had clearly disrupted the day-to-day work of vaccinating people as quickly as possible.

“The effect that it may have is over the longer term,"" Lee said. ""It will just take longer to achieve the levels of coverage that we need to achieve to slow the spread of the virus.""

Public health officials have said that more than 70 percent of the population would have to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity and stunt the pandemic.

Dr. Peter Hotez, a dean at the Baylor College of Medicine who specializes in vaccine delivery, said time is of the essence especially because the spread of new coronavirus variants may reinfect people who’ve already had Covid-19.

“We’re in a bit of a race. We’re in a race against these variants, so it’s really a crisis,” Hotez said. “Any vaccine we have, now is the time to give it out.”

One strain first identified in the U.K. is doubling its reach about every 10 days, according to a study published this month.

South Carolina’s state health department said it had warned providers in the state to expect delayed shipments, advising them to “frequently check the tracking numbers” provided for their weekly shipments.

But the extreme weather was also making it difficult for clinics to operate. Some clinics closed Tuesday from Indiana to Maine, from Michigan to Texas, and places in between. In Florida, the Public grocery chain said it was delaying the launch of an online portal to schedule vaccine appointments because of the weather.

Some clinics planned delayed openings Wednesday, depending on the weather.",MSNBC,"['states', 'immunity', 'experts', 'longer', 'health', 'delayed', 'extreme', 'delay', 'weather', 'spread', 'shipments', 'warn', 'vaccine', 'herd', 'reach', 'reaching', 'vaccination']",0

2021-02-17 02:43:05+00:00,18,"Hard-charging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has often found it hard to say I'm sorry, but he may have to apologize after news that his office deliberately withheld data about Covid-19 nursing home deaths from state lawmakers and the public, Democratic Party insiders said Tuesday.

""He needs to make a sincere apology to the families of the victims,"" said a longtime Democratic Party strategist, who asked not to be identified by name. ""I know it's hard for him to apologize, but he just has to. It's the right thing to do, and the Republicans have made this a cause célèbre to go after him.""

Another party insider, who also asked not to be identified by name, said Cuomo ""presented himself as a truth-teller.""

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""This is a dagger in the heart of that narrative,"" the insider said.

The dagger was delivered last month by state Attorney General Letitia James, who released a damning report that said the state Health Department underreported the Covid-19 death toll at nursing homes by as much as 50 percent.

Fanning the flames further was the admission last week by Cuomo's top aide, Melissa DeRosa, first reported by the New York Post, that the state held off on releasing the fuller death count in August because of fears that President Donald Trump would use the information against Cuomo.

Democratic and Republican lawmakers are now reported to be reconsidering their decision to grant Cuomo emergency powers to contend with the Covid-19 crisis.

Cuomo conceded Monday that ""things should have been done differently"" and insisted that ""lessons were learned.""

""In retrospect, should we have given more priority to fulfilling information requests? In my opinion, yes. And that's what created the void,"" Cuomo said. ""I just want to make sure people know these are the facts: Everything that could have been done was done.""

But Cuomo didn't apologize.

The Democratic insider said that not only was that a missed opportunity for Cuomo but that it also handed more ammunition to Republicans still smarting over his stealing the leadership spotlight from Trump by giving daily briefings that drew a national audience and widespread praise.

""Andrew Cuomo presented a juxtaposition to President Trump during the pandemic, and many Americans felt it was a master class in leadership and decisiveness,"" the party insider said. ""Many Americans looked to Gov. Cuomo for answers, not to the president.""

But James' report ""completely undermines that narrative,"" he said.

It's also starting to be reflected in Cuomo's poll numbers. Since November, his approval rating has slipped from 56 percent to 51 percent, according to a new Siena College poll.

The pollsters found that majorities approved of Cuomo's job in addressing the pandemic (61 percent) and gave him high marks for communicating with New Yorkers about the crisis (67 percent). But 55 percent of New Yorkers gave him a negative grade for reporting the Covid-19 nursing home deaths.

""New Yorkers saw with their own two eyes how Gov. Cuomo worked day and night to get us on the other side of this pandemic,"" said Rich Azzopardi, a senior advisor for the governor. ""There are politics and then there are facts, and the facts in this poll shows the governor's favorability is rock solid and virtually unchanged and, nearly a year in, an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers approve of his handling of the pandemic.""

Evan Stavisky, a longtime political consultant with The Parkside Group, said he doesn't think Cuomo needs to worry just yet.

""New York is a very blue state, and New Yorkers are, by and large, happy with the governor,"" he said. ""There's no human being that's without fault ... but I think the reports of his demise are greatly exaggerated.""

In addition, he said, Democratic voters don't expect Cuomo to apologize.

""Does he have the right tone? He's always had this style,"" Stavisky said. ""It's baked into the voters' perception of him. He's not going to suddenly change his style now. ... At this point, I'd rather be Andrew Cuomo than anybody else trying to challenge him.""

New York was hit hard in the early days of the pandemic, and until recently the state led the country in Covid-19 deaths. It had recorded 47,177 as of Tuesday, second only to California's 47,277 deaths, according to the most recent NBC News data.

Most of New York's deaths came in the early days of the pandemic, when public health officials were trying to figure out how the coronavirus was spreading.

Cuomo was criticized for having waited until May to reverse a state policy that required long-term care facilities to accept recovering patients who might still test positive for the virus.

Then Cuomo insisted that it was up to the nursing homes to alert state health officials if they weren't equipped to take care of infected residents. And a report issued by the state in July blamed the more than 8,500 deaths of seniors on staffers who unwittingly infected residents.

James, who is also a Democrat, launched her investigation last spring after whistleblowers reported that residents who had tested positive for the coronavirus were being ""intermingled"" with healthy residents, that the nursing homes were failing to adequately test workers for the virus and that they were making ""sick employees continue to work and care for residents or face retaliation or termination.""

Soon, investigators began noticing discrepancies between the numbers of Covid-19 nursing home deaths they were seeing and the numbers being reported by the Cuomo-controlled state Health Department.

Dr. Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, insisted in a statement after James' report became public that there was no ""undercount.""

""The word 'undercount' implies there are more total fatalities than have been reported; this is factually wrong,"" Zucker said. ""The OAG's report is only referring to the count of people who were in nursing homes but transferred to hospitals and later died. The OAG suggests that all should be counted as nursing home deaths and not hospital deaths even though they died in hospitals.""

2021-02-16 23:14:03+00:00,27,"WASHINGTON — Despite a finding by the World Health Organization that the Covid-19 outbreak in China most likely first infected humans through an animal host, the United States is still not ruling out the possibility of a laboratory accident, as officials continue to sort through intelligence about the Chinese government’s initial handling of the outbreak, American and Western officials told NBC News.

A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told NBC News the agency is standing by a public statement it issued in April, which said that American intelligence agencies ""will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.""

U.S. officials have not made public any evidence pointing to a lab accident, and most scientists who have studied the matter said that such a scenario is unlikely. But Biden administration officials have faulted China in recent days for what they have termed a lack of transparency around the origins of the virus. And they have criticized how the WHO last week presented the initial findings of a visit to Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have emerged.

WHO investigators, after visiting three labs in Wuhan, said last week they found no signs that a lab accident could have caused the outbreak. One WHO researcher told reporters at a news conference the organization was halting any further inquiry into that theory.

But the director general of the WHO appeared to walk back that definitive statement a few days later, saying that ""all hypotheses remain open and require further analysis and study.""

A Western intelligence official who has seen classified material told NBC News the U.S. has substantial intelligence that has not been made public about actions the Chinese government took — related to the Wuhan lab and other issues — that were designed to obscure the origins of Covid-19 and conceal its early impact. A former U.S. official who has also seen the intelligence agreed that it was significant, if inconclusive.

Both sources said the material, which they did not detail, did not add up to evidence that a lab accident occurred. But they said it raised enough circumstantial questions that analysts have been unable to rule out the lab scenario. U.S. intelligence officials declined to comment.

The intelligence, which includes documents, paints a picture of a Chinese government initially trying to hide the burgeoning pandemic from the outside world.

""There is no doubt that, especially when Covid-19 first hit but even today, China is falling far short of the mark when it comes to providing the information necessary to the international community,"" Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told NBC's Andrea Mitchell this month. ""All of the — that lack of transparency, that lack of being forthcoming, is a profound problem and it's one that continues.""

The lab theory

The so-called lab theory refers to a hypothesis that the Covid outbreak emerged in Wuhan as a result of an accidental release from one of the labs working with coronaviruses in that city — perhaps from an improper disposal of lab waste or an employee who got infected at work and then infected others.

U.S. intelligence agencies and scientists say they have ruled out that Covid-19 was human-made or intentionally released. The lab theory hypothesizes an accidental release of a virus found in nature by researchers and brought in for study.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Scientists say that scenario is unlikely on its face, because animal-to-human transmission of viruses are common, while lab accidents are relatively rare. The key scientists studying viruses in Wuhan say they were not studying the Covid-19 virus, which had not been previously documented in nature before the outbreak.

Intelligence officials counter that one key lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, removed from public view a database of 22,000 virus samples for security reasons, and has not allowed a detailed look at the lab's notes or other records.

They say it's suspicious that the virus outbreak arose in Wuhan, a hub of virus research in China, while the bats that commonly carry coronaviruses are typically found in caves a thousand miles from that city.

They note that scientists also have not found a host animal that could have transferred the virus to humans, after a year of looking.

WHO researchers acknowledged last week that the ""wet"" or live-animal market in Wuhan, which was originally thought to be a likely source of the outbreak, may not be the whole story, since early cases have been identified in people who had no connection to the market.

The WHO team included international and Chinese scientists. They say their summary report will be published within weeks.

One member of the team, Australian microbiologist and infectious diseases expert Dominic Dwyer, told NBC News that the scientists didn't get all the data they sought from the Chinese government, and that team members disagreed about various aspects of what they saw and heard.

""There were tense moments and disagreements and, you know, arguments about what things meant and so on, between both sides,"" Dwyer said. ""And some of that is just because the data isn't strong enough to give a single, a great conclusion.""

Dwyer says the team was given ""aggregated data,"" as opposed to detailed, line-by-line case information, for the 174 known Covid cases from Wuhan in December.

Case information would enable researchers, he said, to ""go along to a person who had this disease and say, OK, you know, how old are you? You know, what sort of work do you do? Who's in your family? What do you do for your hobbies? You know, do you go to the market? What sort of market do you go to, you know, what's your general health, like, all of those sorts of things to try and understand where a person had been, and where they could have been exposed to something.""

Several members of the WHO team told NBC News they were provided with just 13 DNA sequences from the 174 cases. Of those, five had small genomic differences, suggesting a wider pool of virus, Dwyer said, though the sample was so small it was hard to draw conclusions.

""Actual infections is probably much higher than the 174,"" Dwyer said.

WHO investigators tasked Chinese researchers with surveying the wider community, he added.

According to Dwyer, the Chinese researchers said they examined the cases of 76,000 people presenting with fever or pneumonia from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2019, and found 92 people with Covid-like symptoms. Of these, they tested 67 people, Dwyer said, and found no Covid-19 antibodies.

Those tests were carried out in January 2021, more than a year after the potential exposure. Scientists don't yet know how long Covid-19 antibodies remain in the body after infection.

Pompeo and the lab theory

The Trump administration, and in particular, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, repeatedly said there was significant evidence in support of the lab theory.

On Jan. 15, five days before the end of the Trump administration, the State Department published a ""fact sheet"" making a series of allegations about the Wuhan Institute of Virology laboratory.

Among them: ""The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses. This raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli's public claim that there was 'zero infection' among the WIV's staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses.""

The fact sheet added, ""Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian institution, the United States has determined that the WIV has collaborated on publications and secret projects with China's military. The WIV has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017.""

One former official familiar with the intelligence on which Pompeo's statement is based said it was less than rock solid, and that some officials were surprised that the secretary aired it publicly. Pompeo did not respond to requests for comment made through his spokesman.

Dwyer told NBC News the WHO team inquired about the testing of researchers at the WIV lab and was told that there were standard tests of all staff in April 2019 and then again in 2020. They were told those tests were negative. But it's not clear when the 2020 tests were carried out, again raising questions about whether Coronavirus would be detected.

2021-02-16 20:06:02+00:00,100,"As Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial unfolded last week, a variety of Republicans complained that the proceedings were unimportant. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), for example, called the trial ""stupid,"" adding that policymakers ""should be focused"" instead on vaccine distribution and economic relief.

The Republican National Committee added soon after, ""Every day Democrats spend on their post-presidency impeachment is another day Americans go without the help they need.""

The irony of such rhetoric was that Republicans had this largely backwards, as Democrats managed to walk and chew gum at the same time. As the Washington Post reported this morning, the ""American Rescue Plan"" continued to inch forward, despite last week's proceedings.

Despite divisions within the House Democratic caucus, Democrats have largely unified behind the legislation. Nine House committees passed their individual portions of the bill last week, fighting back GOP attempts to alter it with dozens of amendments targeting everything from abortion to the minimum wage to the Keystone XL pipeline. Democrats defeated all the GOP amendments save for one, a relatively minor measure in the Agriculture Committee aimed at compensating farmers impacted by derecho storms last year.

By most accounts, a floor vote in the House is expected next week. Though Democratic margins in the chamber are narrow, it's generally expected to pass.

It would then go to the Democratic-led Senate, where the party's margin is even smaller, and where more conservative Democratic members have already voiced opposition to major elements of President Joe Biden's proposed relief package, including a provision to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

The odds of the Senate approving a bill are pretty good, but the odds of the Senate approving the House's bill, without significant changes, are low. This is relevant, of course, because officials will quickly start running out of calendar: enhanced unemployment benefits are set to expire in mid-March, and the White House is determined to sign this legislation into law ahead of that deadline.

As for Republicans, it's striking that a $1.9 trillion relief package is taking shape, and while there's no reason to expect broad bipartisan support for the bill, the GOP opposition hasn't taken shape in earnest. In fact, at this point, there doesn't appear to be any coordinated pushback against the Democratic effort at all.

Complicating matters for Republicans, House GOP leaders now expect at least some -- not many, but some -- of their own members to end up supporting the Democratic relief package, which would certainly get the attention of centrist Democratic senators, and give the bill a bipartisan boost with the public.

""We now have all the pieces in place for the rapid distribution of vaccines. But we still need to scale up production,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, told a news briefing.

""We continue to call for Covid-19 vaccine developers to submit their dossiers to WHO for review at the same time as they submit them to regulators in high-income countries,"" he said.

A WHO statement said it had approved the vaccine as produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India.

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

The listing by the U.N. health agency comes days after a WHO panel provided interim recommendations on the vaccine, saying two doses with an interval of around 8 to 12 weeks should be given to all adults, and can be used in countries with the South African variant of the coronavirus, as well.

The WHO's review found that the Astrazeneca vaccine met the ""must-have"" criteria for safety, and its efficacy benefits outweighed its risks.

The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot has been hailed because it is cheaper and easier to distribute than some rivals, including that of Pfizer-BioNTech, which was listed for emergency use by the WHO late in December.

Nearly 109 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and more than 2.5 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.

Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.

Doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine make up the lion's share of doses in the COVAX coronavirus vaccine sharing scheme, with more than 330 million doses of the shot due to begin being rolled out to poorer countries from the end of February.

The WHO established its emergency use listing (EUL) process to help poorer countries without their own regulatory resources quickly approve medicines for new diseases like Covid-19, which otherwise could lead to delays.

The COVAX Facility, which is co-led by the vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the U.N. Children’s Fund, has said doses would cover an average of 3.3 percent of total populations of 145 participating countries.",MSNBC,"['countries', 'shot', 'approves', 'world', 'covid19', 'astrazenecaoxford', 'coronavirus', 'doses', 'health', 'emergency', 'million', 'vaccine']",0
2021-02-15 21:31:06+00:00,147,"With Donald Trump's second impeachment trial complete, attention on Capitol Hill is quickly shifting to the pending COVID relief package, which the U.S. House continued to debate even as the proceedings in the U.S. Senate unfolded last week.

The ambitious package, proposed by President Joe Biden, continues to be a heavy lift, especially given policy divisions among Democrats. It doesn't help that congressional Republicans appear overwhelmingly opposed to the effort.

But the Washington Post raised an interesting point about the partisan dispute: outside of the Beltway, Republican attitudes toward the White House's relief package bear little resemblance to the obstinacy in D.C.

[T]o many Republicans at city halls and statehouses across the country, the relief package looks very different. Instead of the ""blue-state bailout"" derided by GOP lawmakers, Republican mayors and governors say they see badly needed federal aid to keep police on the beat, to prevent battered Main Street businesses from going under and to help care for the growing ranks of the homeless and the hungry.

Pointing to the article via Twitter this morning, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain described the report as, ""Today's episode of: 'Yes, it really IS bipartisan.'""

This is about far more than bragging rights. It's no secret that there are some congressional Democrats -- most notably Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- who've stressed the importance of Republican support for Biden's proposal. Indeed, by some accounts, members such as Manchin might derail the entire legislative initiative unless the bill can be fairly characterized as bipartisan, which could have the effect of giving the GOP veto power over the relief package.

And that's where the debate over the definition of ""bipartisan"" begins in earnest.

For the White House, the emphasis seems to be on the totality of the circumstances: the COVID relief plan has received support from Republican mayors, Republican governors, and Republican voters. The budget resolution that cleared the way for the bill even included Republican amendments. To the extent that it's necessary, the ""bipartisan"" box has been checked.

Whether that's good enough for the relevant players remains to be seen, but I hope they'll remember this quote from Jerry Dyer, Fresno's Republican mayor: ""It's not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. It's a public health issue. It's an economic issue.

2021-02-15 12:02:02+00:00,86,"Starting this week, the federal government is shipping 1 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine directly to retail pharmacies, giving many Americans the opportunity to get their shot closer to home.

The plan is to address supply chain snags that contributed to a slow rollout of the vaccine.

“90 percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a pharmacy and the nation’s 40,000 regional and national pharmacy locations are vital for scaling Covid-19 vaccinations,” Steven C. Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, said last week.

The new shipment, part of the first phase of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, will go to 6,500 stores nationwide, including CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid locations in select states. That number is expected to increase in the coming weeks based on supply. Before, stores only had access to doses through limited state allocations.

Some pharmacies are expected to start vaccinating eligible individuals with these doses as early as Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Kate Grusich told NBC News.

But how do people know if the new supply is coming to their neighborhoods and how do they book their shots?

Limited supply

Access is limited. Since the program is only in its initial phase, not every store in every state will receive the doses. However, the stores will include CVS locations in states such as California, New York, Texas and Maryland, and Walgreens locations in others such as Arizona, Illinois and North Carolina, to name a few. There are 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Clubs pharmacies in 22 states such as Alaska, Colorado and Tennessee which will also receive doses.

See here for a full list of participating partners. The NBC News ""Plan Your Vaccine"" online tool can also help people get started.

Booking appointments

People will have to answer screening questions at the store's websites to make sure they're eligible for the current allocation in their area, and select whether they're booking both the shots or just their second.

Then, they will have to search by their city/state or ZIP code to find nearby stores with available doses and appointment slots.

Stores may show as ""Fully Booked"" or ""Available,"" and people then must click on a store with supply and open appointments to choose their time slots.

CVS and Walgreens - Appointments can be made starting Thursday. Vaccinations will begin Friday. They can also be booked through each store's app.

Walmart and Sam’s Club - Vaccination portals are open. Sam’s Club membership is not required.

Publix - Portal open.

Kroger - Portal open.

Costco - Portal open but may redirect you to government sites for scheduling, depending on area.

Rite Aid - Limited appointments. Check with your local health department.

Albertsons - Available at select locations.

Independent pharmacies - Check your local store's website or call as it may vary.

What should I bring to my appointment(s)?

Medical or Medicare insurance card

Pharmacy card

If people are uninsured or their state requires proof of age for eligibility requirements, they should bring their driver’s license and/or another government-issued proof of identity, such as your Social Security card or number.

People may be prompted to print and sign a vaccination consent form to speed the check-in process. Otherwise they can complete it at the store.

What about my second appointment?

Most pharmacies will follow up with text and/or email alerts about both appointments.

Trusted local pharmacists

Pharmacists say that the new program hopes to bring vaccine rollout down to a community level, with local pharmacists whom people know and trust. That's a special concern when misinformation and confusion have contributed to questions and distrust of the vaccine, especially among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and minorities.

""When you have issues of vaccine hesitancy and whether people want to do it or not, they want to talk to their local health care provider and their pharmacist ... who cares for them every day of the year,"" Kurt Proctor, senior vice president of strategic initiatives of the National Community Pharmacists Association, said by phone.

2021-02-15 11:03:04+00:00,53,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand’s largest city of Auckland will go into a three-day lockdown beginning just before midnight Sunday following the discovery of three unexplained coronavirus cases in the community.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the move after an urgent meeting with other top lawmakers in the Cabinet. She said they decided to take a cautious approach until they find out more about the outbreak, including whether the infections are of the more contagious variants.

The lockdown is the first in New Zealand in six months and represents a significant setback in the nation’s largely successful efforts to control the virus. It will also force a delay in the America’s Cup sailing regatta.

New Zealand had successfully stamped out community spread, and many people elsewhere in the world looked on in envy as New Zealanders went back to work and began attending concerts and sporting events without the need to wear masks or take other precautions.

Indeed, Ardern on Sunday had planned to attend the Big Gay Out, an Auckland festival that celebrates the rainbow community and attracts tens of thousands of people. She ended up canceling those plans and returning to Wellington to manage the outbreak.

“I’m asking New Zealanders to continue to be strong and to be kind,” Ardern said at a hastily arranged press conference on Sunday evening. “I know we all feel the same way when this happens. We all get that sense of ‘Not again.’ But remember, we have been here before and that means we know how to get out of this again, and that is together.”

New Zealand’s greatest vulnerability has been at the border.

New cases are regularly caught among returning travelers, all of whom are required to spend two weeks in quarantine. Despite precautions, there have been several times when the virus has leaked out from the border before being controlled again, and officials are trying to determine whether that’s happened again.

In the latest case, an Auckland mother, father and daughter caught the disease. Officials said the mother works at a catering company that does laundry for airlines, and officials are investigating whether there is a link to infected passengers. Officials said the woman hadn’t been going aboard the planes herself.

Officials said the rest of New Zealand outside of Auckland will also be placed under heightened restrictions, although will not go into lockdown.

“We are gathering all of the facts as quickly as we can, and the system that served us so well in the past is really gearing up to do so again,” said Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins.

He described the cases as new and active. He said scientists are carrying out genome sequencing to see whether they are variants, and also to see whether they match with any infected passengers.

“New Zealand has kept Covid-19 contained better than almost any other country,” Hipkins said. “But as we have kept saying, there is no such thing as no risk.”

The U.S. has ""severely undermined multilateral institutions, including the WHO,"" the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement. It appeared to be referring to the notification that the U.S. would withdraw from the organization in July — a decision that has been reversed by the Biden administration.

The U.S. ""gravely damaged international cooperation on Covid-19,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""acting as if none of this had ever happened"" while ""pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfully supporting the WHO.""

""With such a track record, how can it win the confidence of the whole world?"" it added.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Saturday that the U.S. had ""deep concerns"" about how the findings of the WHO's investigation were communicated.

""It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,"" he said in a statement. ""To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak.""

U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Sunday that Britain shared concerns that the investigators ""get full co-operation and they get the answers they need.""

""We'll be pushing for [the WHO mission] to have full access, get all the data it needs to be able to answer the questions that I think most people want to hear answered around the outbreak, the causes,"" he told the BBC. ""And that's important, not for geopolitical point-scoring or anything like that, but so we can learn the lessons and prevent it ever happening again.""

The four-week inquiry in China was plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington.

The team released its preliminary findings last week.

Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert on the WHO team, told Reuters on Saturday that it had requested raw patient data about 174 cases that China had identified from the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan, as well as other cases, but that it was provided with only a summary.

Other media reports suggested that investigators had been denied data they asked for during their trip.

However, another member of the team, John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the U.K.'s Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, told the BBC on Sunday that ""a great deal of data"" was provided by the Chinese and that criticism over what information was handed over did not ""characterize the mission as a whole.""

A British zoologist, Peter Daszak, president of the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance, tweeted Saturday: ""As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterpart,"" adding that the team got access to critical new data throughout.

Another member of the team, Thea Kølsen Fischer, an epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, tweeted that she and her colleagues built ""a good relationsship"" with their Chinese counterparts.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that it is imperative that the report be independent and free from ""alteration by the Chinese government"", echoing concerns raised by the administration of former President Donald Trump, who also moved to quit the WHO over the issue.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said all hypotheses are still open about the origins of Covid-19, after Washington said it wanted to review data from a WHO-led mission to China, where the virus first emerged.

A WHO-led mission, which spent four weeks in China looking into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak, said this week that it was not looking further into the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab, which it considered highly unlikely.

The Trump administration had said it suspected the virus may have escaped from a Chinese lab, which Beijing strongly denies.

Sullivan noted that President Joe Biden had quickly reversed the decision to disengage from the WHO, but said it was imperative to protect the organization's credibility.

""Re-engaging the WHO also means holding it to the highest standards,"" Sullivan said. ""We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.""

Biden, who is spending his first weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in the mountains of western Maryland, will meet with his national security advisers on Saturday, a White House official said.

China refused to give raw data on early Covid-19 cases to the WHO-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, according to one of the team's investigators, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began.

The team had requested raw patient data on 174 cases that China had identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, as well as other cases, but were only provided with a summary, Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert who is a member of the WHO team, told Reuters.

""The hypothetical suggested by the gentleman from Florida has no bearing on this case,"" he said. Van der Veen then came up to speak, and said Rubio was right in outlining what would become a ""slippery slope,"" adding that senators can decide to acquit Trump on a number of technicalities.

Sen. Cassidy asks whether Trump was tolerant of rioters intimidating Pence Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., asked both sides whether Trump's tweet attacking Pence on Jan. 6 after he spoke to Sen. Tuberville about Pence being evacuated suggests that Trump was tolerant of the intimidation posed by the rioters to Pence. ""Directly, no,"" Trump lawyer van der Veen said. ""But I dispute the premise of your facts. I dispute the facts that are laid out in that question. And, unfortunately, we're not going to know the answer to the facts in this proceeding because the House did nothing to investigate what went on."" Trump's lawyer continued by saying he had ""no idea"" what the answer is because the House didn't provide an opportunity to investigate further. Leader House manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., argued in response to the question that the managers invited Trump to testify before Congress himself about the events and had the chance to set the record straight. Raskin, however, noted that Trump declined and according to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in civil cases, if the defendant refuses to testify, then it implies guilt. ""Rather than yelling at us...bring your client here and have him testify under oath,"" Raskin said. Share this -

Republican Georgia election official disputes Trump's impeachment defense Gabriel Sterling, who serves as a top Georgia election official, disputed a claim made by one of President Trump's defense lawyers during the impeachment trial regarding the infamous call between the former president and Georgia's secretary of state. Trump's attorney Bruce Castor claimed that the president's call with Brad Raffensperger was misconstrued by the media. Castor said the president was concerned about the drop in rejection rates of ballots during the 2020 election. In the call, Trump also appeared to pressure Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, to “find” him enough votes to overturn his election loss to Joe Biden. That call is cited in the impeachment article and now part of a criminal probe in Georgia. However, Sterling said in a tweet on Friday that Castor had it wrong. OK...piecing this together. The initial absentee rejection rate for signature issue was about double in 2020 as 2018. There is a cure period now and the final rate was 0.15% in both years.

Fact check: Trump attorney says call to Georgia's Raffensperger was totally proper Castor spent a lengthy chunk of time talking about Trump’s phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (who Castor inaccurately referred to as “Ben Roeffensperger"") in which he demanded proof of widespread voter fraud. The call, Castor said, couldn’t possibly be part of the former president’s attempt to incite violence because he didn’t release it. But Castor nonetheless spent ample time discussing the call and Georgia’s election broadly. He repeated Trump’s false and baseless claims that there was fraud, and seemingly attempting to justify his phone call as entirely proper. Democrats, meanwhile, have cited the call as proof that Trump tried to overturn the election, not as proof of incitement. Castor also suggested that the rejection rate for absentee ballots in Georgia should have been higher, as it had been in the past; he did not acknowledge that the state standardized their process and trained election workers in proper signature-matching techniques before the election. And the ultimate rejection rate in 2020 was the same as it was in 2018, according to Georgia's election systems manager, Gabriel Sterling. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in Georgia, despite numerous investigations and inquires by state officials. OK...piecing this together.

Trump’s lawyers keep talking criminal standards. That’s not how impeachment works. Trump’s attorneys repeatedly applied the standards of a courtroom to the Senate trial, failing to acknowledge that impeachment is not a criminal sanction — it’s a political one. In his defense, van der Veen claimed Trump’s rhetoric was not incitement because it was free speech protected by the First Amendment. He went on to say it did not satisfy the Brandenburg test, a legal precedent that reviews if inflammatory speech is protected free speech or can be criminally punished as incitement to violence. This is misleading, because these are all criminal standards and precedents; impeachment is not a criminal sanction, governed by the Bill of Rights. Van der Veen also argued that Trump's team was being victimized by criticisms that their First Amendment argument was frivolous, because attorneys can be sanctioned by a judge for advancing frivolous lawsuits in a court of law. The Senate is a political court, however, where historically there has always been room for frivolous arguments. Share this -

House managers' team responds to Trump lawyers' claims about edited tweets and videos A senior aide to the House managers said Trump's lawyers were wrong to accuse the managers of manipulating Trump videos and tweets. Trump's attorneys also took Democrats' comments out of context when playing video clips during the trial, the aide said. ""Somewhere in between repeatedly showing video of comments from Democrats cut entirely out of their context, Trump’s attorney leveled a false accusation of selective editing at the House managers, and in doing so, selectively edited the managers’ presentation to make his point,"" the aide said. Attorney David Schoen, for example, claimed that the Democratic managers played a clip from Trump's Jan. 6 speech in which he told the crowd they would ""walk down"" to the Capitol, alleging Democrats cut off the president's comments about going ""peacefully and patriotically"" to make their voices heard and cheer on some members of Congress. Schoen suggested that was an attempt by Democrats to make it look like Trump had incited the crowd. ""Schoen’s statement is incorrect. Rep. Dean showed this entire portion of President Trump’s speech —twice,"" of Trump saying it and also from the crowd's perspective, the aide said. The aide also said Trump's Twitter account had been suspended, requiring them to recreate some of his tweets graphically, which led to a blue verified badge to be added erroneously to one of the images.

Analysis: The president's speech is less protected than that of lawmakers The Constitution specifically creates stronger protections for the speech and actions of lawmakers engaged in their duties. Contained in Article I, it is colloquially called “the speech or debate clause.” The clause, according to the Congressional Research Service, “serves chiefly to protect the independence, integrity, and effectiveness of the legislative branch by barring executive or judicial intrusions into the protected sphere of the legislative process.” It says that members of Congress cannot be held to account for their speech or debate in any other forum but Congress. There is no such constitutional provision protecting the president’s speech or public acts. The standard for protection of legislative speech is, therefore, higher than that of presidential speech. And, of course, the Senate is not making a law prohibiting free speech in the impeachment case. Share this -

'This is not whataboutism': Trump team replays video of Democrats in First Amendment defense In presenting the former president's First Amendment defense, Michael T. van der Veen said Trump's rally speech on Jan. 6 ""deserves full protection"" under the Constitution and mocked the House managers as forming an argument based on ""total intellectual dishonesty."" Van der Veen then presented a textbook slippery-slope argument — that if Trump could be convicted over his speech and actions in connection to the riot at the Capitol, no political speech would be safe, and that politicians would now face the threat of impeachment for any speech. ""You can see where this would lead,"" he said. Before replaying a heavily edited clip of Democrats making incendiary remarks, van der Veen said: ""This is not whataboutism."" ""I am showing you this to make the point that all political speech must be protected,"" he said. ""I did not show you the speech to balance out the speech of my client."" ""All robust speech should be protected, and it should be protected evenly for all of us,"" he said. Meanwhile, nearly 150 leading First Amendment lawyers and constitutional scholars from all over the political spectrum wrote a letter saying the Trump team's First Amendment argument is ""legally frivolous,"" The New York Times reported. ""In other words, we all agree that the First Amendment does not prevent the Senate from convicting President Trump and disqualifying him from holding future office,"" the attorneys and scholars wrote.

Analysis: What Hillary Clinton didn’t do Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen argued that Trump just did what Democrats did when Hillary Clinton lost: challenge the results, seek recounts and push to reject the certification of electors. What Hillary Clinton did not do is rally her supporters in Washington, ask them to go to the Capitol, tell them to “stop the steal” and praise them after they stormed the Capitol and looked to kill or otherwise harm elected officials. The reason that she didn’t offer that encouragement is twofold. First, she, at every turn, starting from her concession speech the day after the 2016 election — Trump never gave one — made a point of embracing the rule of law. Second, her supporters didn’t storm the Capitol or threaten elected officials during a riot at the Capitol. “I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president,” she said on Nov. 9, 2016. “Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don’t just respect that — we cherish it.""

Sen. Whitehouse rejects rhetorical equivalence argument Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said Friday that he rejects the idea that there's no difference between Trump's rhetoric preceding the Jan. 6 attack and the comments of Democratic leaders last year after the death of George Floyd. Asked about his response to the defense's expected equivalency argument in an interview with CNN, Whitehouse said, ""It's false and the obvious differentiation is the events of January 6. We actually had a mob that was, in fact, incited and that came up to the Capitol and that looted and ransacked the place with the intention of disrupting the constitutional process of transfer of power, and did so at the behest of and at the direction of Donald Trump."" ""It's really impossible to compare that to anything else,"" Whitehouse continued. ""There's a lot of, you know, political rhetoric out there. This was different and the prosecution showed it."" Whitehouse said the Trump defense team is ""trying to hang on for dear life"" and that ""they can still blow this."" Share this -

GOP senators met with Trump legal team to discuss 'strategy' Trump's legal team met with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Thursday afternoon after the House managers rested their case. Graham was spotted leaving the meeting, saying, ""See you tomorrow."" Cruz said they were ""discussing their legal strategy and sharing our thoughts."" The meeting raised eyebrows, as senators who will be voting on whether to convict Trump were also strategizing with his legal team. But they're just following in the footsteps of Mitch McConnell, who as Senate majority leader during Trump's first impeachment trial said he was ""coordinating with the White House counsel."" ""There will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time. Trump defense attorney David Schoen told reporters after the meeting: ""I think it's the best practice here in impeachment. There's nothing about this thing that has any semblance of due process whatsoever."" Share this -

Schoen says Trump defense arguments might take just 3 to 4 hours Trump's lawyer David Schoen said his team thinks it will need only a few hours to deliver its defense arguments. Speaking to reporters after the House managers finished their arguments Thursday, Schoen said Trump's team may go for about ""three to four hours, something like that,"" on Friday. He also criticized the case made by the House managers, saying they had turned the evidence into ""an entertainment piece,"" which he said was ""horrific."" Share this -

Managers expect 'distraction campaign' from Trump defense team, senior aides say Senior aides on the House impeachment managers' team told reporters Friday morning that they expect a ""distraction campaign"" from the Trump's defense team when the trial begins in the afternoon. “I have no doubt that there will be very little substantive defense presented today by the defense because there is no defense,"" an aide said. The aides said that they expected to hear legal arguments from Trump's defense team that are “extraordinarily dangerous in a Constitutional republic."" They said they expect the former president's lawyers, for example, to present the Democrats' incitement argument against Trump as limited only to the one speech he gave on Jan. 6, but the managers have made it clear during their two days of presentations that Trump's rhetoric about the election being rigged predated that rally by many months. The aides also said they expect the defense team will show clips of Democrats using incendiary rhetoric to try to establish some kind of equivalency. But “like so much of what Trump’s lawyers might say, that’s a gimmick, it’s a parlor game meant to inflame partisan hostility and play on our division,"" they said. Share this -

Here's what comes next in the Senate impeachment trial With the House managers having wrapped their case on Thursday, the Senate impeachment trial will move into its next phase — the defense's presentation. Like the prosecution, the defense will have a maximum of 16 hours to present its case, though, like the House managers, they may choose to use less than that allotted time. Following their presentation, senators will have the opportunity to ask questions of both the House managers and the defense. They could then vote on whether to request additional documents and witnesses, although that is not currently expected. Should no additional documents and witnesses be requested, a total of four hours will be given so each side can make their closing arguments before the Senate will advance to voting on whether to convict the president.

FIRST READ: The impeachment case against Trump comes down to this one question The last three days of arguments by the Democratic impeachment managers boil down to this simple question: Is political violence — in support of a president, provoked by a president, never vociferously condemned by a president — ever acceptable in a democracy? As it turns out, we were asking this very question five years ago during the 2016 GOP presidential race. And here was our colleague Benjy Sarlin’s story just two days later: “Donald Trump warned on Wednesday that his supporters would respond with ‘riots’ if he fails to secure the nomination at July’s convention in Cleveland. ‘I think you’d have riots,’ Trump told CNN on Wednesday. ‘I think you’d have riots. I’m representing a tremendous many, many millions of people.’” And it's what Democratic impeachment managers asked yesterday: Is what happened on Jan. 6 — the lead-up to the rally, Donald Trump’s words at the rally, his kind words about the rioters, and his failure to admit he did anything wrong — acceptable to GOP voters and politicians? Because if it is, there will almost certainly be a next time. Get more First Read. Share this -

GOP Sen. Rounds says Lieu's warning left an impression on Republicans When Rep. Lieu warned the Senate that Trump, if acquitted, could run for office again and potentially incite more violence if he loses, it made an impression on some Republicans in the chamber. ""Several of us wrote that down,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters later Thursday. ""I think that was a strong statement on his part."" Lieu had warned earlier in the day: ""I'm not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I'm afraid he's going to run again and lose. Because he can do this again."" Still, Rounds said that questions about what the former president might do later are ""hypotheticals"" and signaled that they wouldn't form the basis of how senators vote. ""What I think right now is that — we're basing everything that we're doing on what's already happened,"" he said. ""And we're not going to try to do hypotheticals about what's happening in the future."" Share this -

Trump has no First Amendment right to incite violence, House managers say House managers sought to cut off Trump's First Amendment defense on Thursday, saying that freedom can't be used to justify the incitement of a deadly riot. For weeks after Joe Biden won the election, Trump willfully lied about election fraud and set the stage for his supporters to violently attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. Neguse: 'No serious argument' First Amendment protects Trump's attempts to incite insurrection Feb. 11, 2021 02:52 ""In the middle of that explosive situation,"" Neguse told senators, ""he struck a match and he aimed it straight at this building, at us."" The former president's power set him apart from an ordinary citizen with no ability to incite mob violence, the House manager argued. ""President Trump just wasn't some guy with politician opinions,"" Neguse said.

Raskin plays clips of Trump endorsing violence before Jan. 6 Raskin argued Thursday that Jan. 6 was a ""culmination of the president's actions, not an aberration from them."" ""His encouragement of violence against other public officials who he thought had crossed him long predates the 2020 campaign,"" Raskin said. Raskin said that white supremacist and extremist groups ""have spread like wildfire"" across the country under Trump, and he played a number of video clips showing Trump encouraging or praising violence. At an October 2015 rally in Miami, Trump told his supporters to ""knock the crap out of"" a protester who was in the audience. ""I promise you I will pay for the legal fees,"" Trump said on stage. Trump was also seen at a March 2016 press conference describing an incident that took place at one of his campaign rallies. He said that someone in the audience began swinging at his supporters. ""He was hitting people and the audience hit back,"" Trump said at the time, adding that the audience's reaction was ""very, very appropriate."" Another video clip showed the incident in which Greg Gianforte, while running for Congress, body-slammed a reporter at a campaign event and broke the reporter's glasses. Trump later joked about the incident at a campaign rally, saying, ""Greg is smart — never wrestle him."" Raskin also played video of Neo-Nazis chanting in Charlottesville, ""Jews will not replace us!"" and repeating that there were ""very fine people on both sides."" Share this -

On her first attempt to get a Covid-19 shot last month, 28-year Leah Robson arrived at a Los Angeles city park at 4 a.m., waited all day with hundreds of other hopefuls, and wound up going home without the vaccination.

She tried again the next day at 2:30 a.m. at the Balboa Sports Complex in the Encino neighborhood and found six people already ahead of her in line. But this time, after another all-day wait she got her shot.

Leah Robson. NBC LA

“It was worth the wait,” Robson told NBC News. “There were about a hundred shots left over at the end of the day that would have gone to waste if they weren’t used, so just about everybody I was in line with got a shot.”

Best of all, Robson said she’s got a confirmed Feb. 25 appointment to get a second dose of the Moderna vaccination.

“I’m very happy,” she said. “It’s been such a stress relief, just being able to walk around knowing that my chances of getting sick are already reduced. But I’m still being careful while everybody around me is being an idiot.”

There are thousands of people like Robson across the country who are chasing the dream of getting a Covid-19 vaccination even though their age, health and profession (she’s in the film industry, not a front-line health care worker) puts them at the end of the line.

Relying on word-of-mouth, social media and new websites that track potential dumps of leftover doses, vaccine chasers are banking on other people not showing up for their appointments or distribution hitches so they can have a shot at getting vaccinated.

“I’m glad they’re prioritizing older people but if there’s a chance I can get it, it’s totally worth staying in line for all day,” Robson said when NBC News interviewed her the first time last month.

Because the vaccine doses have a shelf life of just five hours once defrosted, they have to be used that same day or they will wind up in the garbage. New websites like vaccinehunter.org and Facebook groups like New Jersey Covid Vaccine Sites and Minneapolis Vaccine Hunters have popped up to assist people looking for leftover doses.

“There’s no downside to what we’re doing here,” vaccinehunter.org website founder Brad Johnson told ""NBC Nightly News."" “Any arm is better than the trash.”

The vaccine chasers who are mostly white and well-to do are turning up at community centers that serve mostly minority constituencies, as has happened everywhere from Florida to California. But doctors still say it’s better not to waste the doses -- just as long as the vaccine chasers don’t try to cut the line.

“There are times when we have no one here,” Dr. Jerry P. Abraham, who runs the Kedren Community Health Center in South Los Angeles, told The Los Angeles Times. “And there are times when your inventory has to be either put into someone's arm or discarded, and we refuse to waste a dose.”

Some state and county health departments and even hospitals, all determined not to waste the scarce vaccine doses, have created sign-up sheets where people willing to race over to a vaccination center to get a shot at a moment’s notice can register.

That’s how Martha Crawford, 56, a psychotherapist and cancer survivor in Santa Fe, New Mexico, got her Covid-19 vaccination in a state which is still largely limiting shots to front-line health care workers and people over age 75.

“I just got my NMDOH (New Mexico Department of Health) notification last night and got my first dose of Moderna at my local grocery store pharmacy,” she said in an interview conducted via Twitter.

Crawford said she got a text message from the department of health at 5:37 p.m. Tuesday offering her a 6 p.m. appointment.

“It took me some time to negotiate the website and to understand that I was not being offered various sites, days or times, that this was a first-come, first-served opening about 20 minutes from my house,” she said. “Several other people arrived at the pharmacy when I did. All appeared to have got the same message. And, as far as I could tell, all of them were vaccinated.”

Crawford said she has an incurable “but currently dormant” cancer in her central nervous system.

“So, I was thrilled to have an opportunity to get in, however short the notice,” she said.

The plan is to address supply chain snags that contributed to a slow rollout of the vaccine.

“90 percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a pharmacy and the nation’s 40,000 regional and national pharmacy locations are vital for scaling Covid-19 vaccinations,” Steven C. Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, said last week.

The new shipment, part of the first phase of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, will go to 6,500 stores nationwide, including CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid locations in select states. That number is expected to increase in the coming weeks based on supply. Before, stores only had access to doses through limited state allocations.

Some pharmacies are expected to start vaccinating eligible individuals with these doses as early as Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Kate Grusich told NBC News.

But how do people know if the new supply is coming to their neighborhoods and how do they book their shots?

Limited supply

Access is limited. Since the program is only in its initial phase, not every store in every state will receive the doses. However, the stores will include CVS locations in states such as California, New York, Texas and Maryland, and Walgreens locations in others such as Arizona, Illinois and North Carolina, to name a few. There are 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Clubs pharmacies in 22 states such as Alaska, Colorado and Tennessee which will also receive doses.

See here for a full list of participating partners. The NBC News ""Plan Your Vaccine"" online tool can also help people get started.

Booking appointments

People will have to answer screening questions at the store's websites to make sure they're eligible for the current allocation in their area, and select whether they're booking both the shots or just their second.

Then, they will have to search by their city/state or ZIP code to find nearby stores with available doses and appointment slots.

Stores may show as ""Fully Booked"" or ""Available,"" and people then must click on a store with supply and open appointments to choose their time slots.

CVS and Walgreens - Appointments can be made starting Thursday. Vaccinations will begin Friday. They can also be booked through each store's app.

Walmart and Sam’s Club - Vaccination portals are open. Sam’s Club membership is not required.

Publix - Portal open.

Kroger - Portal open.

Costco - Portal open but may redirect you to government sites for scheduling, depending on area.

Rite Aid - Limited appointments. Check with your local health department.

What should I bring to my appointment(s)?

Medical or Medicare insurance card

Pharmacy card

If people are uninsured or their state requires proof of age for eligibility requirements, they should bring their driver’s license and/or another government-issued proof of identity, such as your Social Security card or number.

People may be prompted to print and sign a vaccination consent form to speed the check-in process. Otherwise they can complete it at the store.

2021-02-12 06:32:02+00:00,57,"People who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 do not need to quarantine if they are exposed to the coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday in updated guidance on its website.

Quarantine is typically recommended for healthy people who have been exposed to the virus. During quarantine, people are asked to isolate from others for one to two weeks to see whether they develop symptoms of Covid-19. By not exposing others, quarantining can help stop the spread of the disease.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In the updated guidance, the CDC said such quarantining is not necessary for fully vaccinated people within three months of having received their last doses as long as they do not develop any symptoms. ""Fully vaccinated"" means that at least two weeks have passed since a person has received the second dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine.

Other recommendations remain in place for fully vaccinated people. They include wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.

The guidance says the risk that fully vaccinated people could spread the coronavirus, to others is ""still uncertain."" However, ""vaccination has been demonstrated to prevent symptomatic Covid-19; symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is thought to have a greater role in transmission than purely asymptomatic transmission,"" according to the CDC.

The CDC already recommends that people who have had Covid-19 and recovered do not need to quarantine for 90 days after the illness, if newly exposed to someone who is infected; the new guidance for vaccinated people aligns with the earlier recommendations.

A spokesperson for the CDC declined to comment about the updated guidance.

The guidance ""makes sense,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, although he said he was curious about what evidence the CDC was using.

Early data from AstraZeneca and Moderna's Phase 3 clinical trials have suggested that vaccines may slow transmission of the virus, although more work is needed to confirm the findings.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist and infection preventionist at George Mason University in Virginia, said the new guidance ""reiterates that there is confidence in protection for those 90 days following vaccination, which is similar to the robust immunity after infection.""

Guidance ""will likely evolve as we get a better understanding of vaccine-derived immunity,"" particularly for those outside the three-month post-vaccination period, Popescu said.

The same glaring inequality is playing out with another group of marginalized people: Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

After being indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now facing corruption charges, this time against the backdrop of his staggering mishandling of a pandemic.

Sound familiar? Well, there’s more.

In the U.S., members of the Philadelphia City Council expressed their concerns last week after new data showed that white residents in the City of Brotherly Love are receiving the Covid-19 vaccination at a rate of three times that of Black residents. Similar reports issued from state and city boards of health around the country indicate that nationwide, the norm is that Black people are being vaccinated at “dramatically lower rates” than white people. Like the virus itself, the coronavirus vaccination rollout highlights a stark racial disparity.

The same glaring inequality is playing out with another group of marginalized people: Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

In the West Bank, Palestinians like my relatives have their freedom of movement — and therefore their freedom to even dream of having a better life — dependent upon Netanyahu and his administration. In Gaza, the Netanyahu administration controls what is allowed in and out of “the world’s largest open-air prison” for the 2 million Palestinians living there. This includes Covid-19 vaccines.

Palestinians have been hit hard by the coronavirus. As United Nation’s human rights experts recently explained, “The Covid-19 pandemic has been ravaging the West Bank and Gaza in recent months, and has fractured an already badly under-resourced Palestinian health care system.” The latest data from the World Health Organization indicates that in the Palestinian territories there have seen more than 180,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and a fatality rate of 1.1 percent. That’s far higher than the 0.7 percent fatality rate reported in Israel.

The Covid-19 crisis is simply a reminder for us of the violence of the racial disparities that have always existed in our nation.

It's hard not to see the parallels to the United States, where Black and brown lives are clearly not valued as much as white ones. The Covid-19 crisis is simply a reminder for us of the violence of the racial disparities that have always existed in our nation.

The New York Times recently reported that while Israel — unlike the U.S. in this aspect — has emerged a world leader in vaccinating its population, “almost all” of the Palestinian residents in the West Bank and Gaza are still awaiting their first doses.

The Netanyahu administration has provided vaccinations to a large number of Israeli settlers who live in the West Bank in violation of international law but has not provided them to the native Palestinians there. The Israeli government has also made vaccinations available for Palestinians living in Israel who are citizens, as well as Palestinians who qualify as permanent residents in east Jerusalem. But Israeli health officials deny any responsibility to assist Palestinians living in the occupied territories.

As Saleh Higazi of Amnesty International summed it up, “There could hardly be a better illustration of how Israeli lives are valued above Palestinian ones.” This hits on a personal level for me. It means the settlers who stole my grandmother’s land after Israel took control of the West Bank in 1967 likely have been vaccinated while my family, who live within walking distance of that settlement outside of Bethlehem, are still waiting for their shots.

Omar Shakir, director of Human Rights Watch in Israel and Palestine, said, “Nothing can justify today’s reality in parts of the West Bank, where people on one side of the street are receiving vaccines, while those on the other do not.”

That sentiment was echoed by the U.N. human rights experts, noting this “differential access to necessary health care in the midst of the worst global health crisis in a century” is both “morally and legally” unacceptable.

That sentiment of course resonates in the U.S., where we’re witnessing the morally unacceptable reality that the privileged are being immunized at far higher rates than the marginalized.

In the U.S., the hope is that the more this glaring inequity is cast in the spotlight, the quicker it will be addressed. If history is any indication, the spotlight doesn’t wield that same potential power in Israel.

History also tells us that, barring the Biden administration taking an unlikely risk and prioritizing Palestinian sovereignty, another generation of Palestinians will live and die under Israeli occupation, this time with the added deadly threat of a global pandemic.

2021-02-11 16:02:03+00:00,58,"People who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 do not need to quarantine if they are exposed to the coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday in updated guidance on its website.

Quarantine is typically recommended for healthy people who have been exposed to the virus. During quarantine, people are asked to isolate from others for one to two weeks to see whether they develop symptoms of Covid-19. By not exposing others, quarantining can help stop the spread of the disease.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In the updated guidance, the CDC said such quarantining is not necessary for fully vaccinated people within three months of having received their last doses as long as they do not develop any symptoms. ""Fully vaccinated"" means that at least two weeks have passed since a person has received the second dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine.

Other recommendations remain in place for fully vaccinated people. They include wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.

The guidance says the risk that fully vaccinated people could spread the coronavirus, to others is ""still uncertain."" However, ""vaccination has been demonstrated to prevent symptomatic Covid-19; symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is thought to have a greater role in transmission than purely asymptomatic transmission,"" according to the CDC.

The CDC already recommends that people who have had Covid-19 and recovered do not need to quarantine for 90 days after the illness, if newly exposed to someone who is infected; the new guidance for vaccinated people aligns with the earlier recommendations.

A spokesperson for the CDC declined to comment about the updated guidance.

The guidance ""makes sense,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, although he said he was curious about what evidence the CDC was using.

Early data from AstraZeneca and Moderna's Phase 3 clinical trials have suggested that vaccines may slow transmission of the virus, although more work is needed to confirm the findings.

Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist and infection preventionist at George Mason University in Virginia, said the new guidance ""reiterates that there is confidence in protection for those 90 days following vaccination, which is similar to the robust immunity after infection.""

Guidance ""will likely evolve as we get a better understanding of vaccine-derived immunity,"" particularly for those outside the three-month post-vaccination period, Popescu said.

2021-02-11 13:48:57+00:00,28,"Around 793,0000 Americans filed a first-time unemployment claim last week, slightly down from the previous week's revised total of 812,000. Economists had forecast 760,000 claims.

Following a spike in coronavirus cases due to holiday travel and family gatherings, the lower number comes after the loosening of restrictions in some states, including the end of a lockdown in California and the return to higher capacity dining in some big cities.

A rash of positive recent economic data has economists and executives forecasting growth for the second half of 2021, propelled by a widespread vaccination rollout and President Joe Biden's fiscal stimulus package. Wall Street traders’ expectations of a rebound have largely been met with positive quarterly reports, and the Congressional Budget Office found that real GDP is expected to bounce back to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of this year, growing by 3.7 percent in 2021, even without any additional stimulus.

Lawmakers are currently debatingBiden's $1.9 trillion fiscal relief package, which focuses on a new round of stimulus checks to struggling Americans and an ambitious vaccine distribution plan to control the deadly pandemic.

The Biden administration, which has stressed its priority of ""shots in arms,"" recently announced it would increase the supply of vaccines by more than one-third. Since Biden took office, the number of doses being sent to states has increased by 28 percent to 11 million doses a week as Pfizer and Moderna ramp up production, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeffrey Zients said on Tuesday.

“It’s the manufacturers doing a good job and the president and the team doing all we can to support that manufacturing,” Zients said. The Biden administration announced last week it would use the Defense Production Act to get Pfizer additional equipment to further increase production.

As the pace of vaccinations gains traction and restrictions are lifted, ""it is reasonable to expect accelerating hiring gains in the coming months,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate, noting that consumers will be ""more enthusiastic, and able to spend, as science is victorious over the pandemic.""

""If and when passed, the [stimulus] package should provide a bridge for those suffering from job or income loss to the later portion of the year when improvement ought to have been seen by then,"" Hamrick added.

In a virtual speech Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell painted a bleak picture of the current jobs market, saying, ""We are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared. Employment in January of this year was nearly 10 million below its February 2020 level, a greater shortfall than the worst of the Great Recession's aftermath.""

Powell noted that almost 5 million people left the workforce last month, partly due to obligations such as child care and supporting remote learning for school-aged children, and partly due to a fear of contracting the virus.

""Extended periods of unemployment can inflict persistent damage on lives and livelihoods while also eroding the productive capacity of the economy,"" Powell warned. He highlighted the damage to the leisure and hospitality sector, which ""dropped over 1/2 million [jobs] in December and a further 61,000 in January.""

With the majority of restaurants and hotels still operating under restrictive measures to prevent spread of the coronavirus, leisure and hospitality remains the hardest-hit sector of the economy, with an unemployment rate almost three times that of the official unemployment rate.

Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said in a statement: “The math is pretty easy: The U.S. economy won’t get back on track until the Leisure & Hospitality sector is back on track, and that’s going to take aggressive policy actions. Safely restarting travel needs to become a national priority, which means not only relief measures but pressing ahead on vaccinations and continuing to emphasize best health practices.""",MSNBC,"['leisure', 'package', 'travel', 'total', 'claims', 'latest', 'jobless', 'weekly', 'million', 'unemployment', 'sector', 'expected', 'week', '793000', 'president', 'stimulus', 'hospitality', 'vs', '760000']",0

“I lost my Dad when I was about 18 years old, and the funeral expenses haunted and followed my family along with many other families in a similar position for years,” Ocasio-Cortez said at a news conference in Queens on Monday. “When you suddenly lose a loved one, you’re talking about an expense of four or five, seven, 10 thousand dollars.”

Black, brown and working-class families have been disproportionately hit by Covid-19, which has meant higher levels of mortality and the many funerals and burials that have followed. Some families have had to set up GoFundMe pages and find other ways to raise money to pay for the costs.

In addition to not having money for those services, many families have to pay for the storage of their loved ones’ bodies until they can be buried, Ocasio-Cortez said.

The money was included in the coronavirus relief bill signed into law in December. The lawmakers want such assistance to be available until the pandemic ends. They said they are working to include more assistance in the American Rescue Plan, the emergency coronavirus relief package that President Joe Biden has proposed to Congress.

The lawmakers say the program will require people applying for the reimbursement to have identifying documentation and a death certificate. Funeral homes would be alerted to the reimbursement to inform families and a toll free line, with assistance in multiple languages, would be set up with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to walk people through the process.

Ocasio-Cortez and Schumer tried last year to get FEMA to provide funeral and burial assistance to families in the same way that it did after Hurricane Sandy, Schumer said.

Schumer said he and Ocasio-Cortez asked FEMA to act on its own to provide assistance as it had before, but it did not, despite the lawmakers' entreaties to the White House and agency.

Since President Joe Biden took office, the number of doses being sent to states has increased by 28 percent to 11 million doses a week as Pfizer and Moderna ramp up production, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeffrey Zients said.

“It’s the manufacturers doing a good job and the president and the team doing all we can to support that manufacturing,” Zients said. The Biden administration announced last week it would use the Defense Production Act to get Pfizer additional equipment to further increase production.

In addition to doses being sent to state governments, federal officials will begin shipping 1 million vaccines directly to 250 community health centers, which serve hard-to-reach groups such as homeless people, migrant workers and public housing residents, said Marcella Nunez-Smith, who is leading Biden’s Covid-19 Equity Task Force.

“Equity is our North Star here,” she said. “This effort that focuses on direct allocation to the community health centers really is about connecting with those hard-to-reach populations across the country.”

People of color have been getting vaccinated at a lower rate than white people, state and federal data indicate. Biden administration officials have attributed that to a range of barriers, such as lesser access to health care in minority communities.

2021-02-10 00:14:02+00:00,43,"WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the first time during the pandemic, will host a nationwide forum on the safest and most effective ways to vaccinate millions of Americans, a Biden official said as the new administration seeks to re-empower scientific agencies sidelined under the previous administration.

The Feb. 22-24 event with national, state, local and tribal medical practitioners is part of a series of initiatives the new administration is taking to signal that the federal government is playing a more aggressive leadership role in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.

The goal is to communicate national standards for how best to build trust and confidence in vaccines and to ensure ""equitable vaccine access and uptake to all populations,"" the official said.

The event, which will include a series of town hall and other sessions, will be led by the CDC's new director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, as well as White House Covid-19 advisers and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. It will also include the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association.

The forum will take place heading into a mass vaccination crunch period — with clinics going up and practitioners being recruited across the country to vaccinate millions of people in a matter of months. The best practices that officials will communicate include how to have safe ""vaccine implementation, with equity and increasing public confidence.""

It's the most recent example of the administration's trying to assert itself in coordinating the Covid-19 response and re-empowering scientific agencies.

Last week, Biden officials announced the first major use of the Defense Production Act, helping Pfizer meet its promise to accelerate vaccine production. Before that, the administration said it would boost deliveries and give states more notice of their allotments.

Morale at the CDC had taken a significant hit during the Trump administration, NBC News reported last year, during months of mixed messages, political pressure and public gaffes about Covid-19.

House Democrats are also investigating allegations of political interference at the agency, including interference with scientific reports disseminated to the public.

Klibaner had a reputation for being analytical — especially at the science and math high school where he met both his future wife and this reporter — and logic would dictate that he had seen Amy enough in the 13 years that they dated to maintain his composure.

Only, that large brain was often overshadowed by an even bigger heart.

""Mike was a huge sap,"" said Amy Klibaner, his wife of nearly 17 years. ""He's the guy who would be crying over Hallmark card commercials.""

These days, however, it's everyone else's turn to cry.

Klibaner died of complications from Covid-19 on April 14 — less than a month before he would have turned 48.

What makes the loss more devastating for his family and friends is that he seemed to be recovering from a relatively manageable case of the virus at his home in New York City, relieved not to need an emergency trip to a swamped hospital during the early weeks of the pandemic. When he collapsed in the bathroom of the apartment he shared with his wife and their 9-year-old daughter, he was brushing his teeth to get ready for his first walk outside in two weeks.

He went into cardiac arrest as the paramedics were taking him down the stairs, the result of what would later be determined as a massive pulmonary embolism.

""They took him to the hospital, and I got a call about an hour later that he passed away,"" Amy Klibaner said. ""It was just so unexpected.""

The loss was so sudden, so devastating, that it's only 10 months later that his family can speak about it. It's only now that this reporter could bring himself to ask the questions.

His daughter, Sidney, who will turn 10 in June, likes to look at a photograph from her infancy in Shanghai in which she is propped up on her father's lap, one hand grasping for his bowl of noodles ""to steal his food,"" as she puts it. The picture reminds her of her dad's smile. He smiled a lot.

""My favorite moment with him is when we swam together because we would race and I would always win, but sometimes I would let him,"" she said by email.

Born May 7, 1972, in Brooklyn, Klibaner was destined for a life of learning as the son of two science teachers.

In some ways, he grew up a regular suburban kid on Staten Island, riding his bike, watching baseball and collecting trading cards. Less typical were his elaborate science projects in middle school. One first-place project that particularly stands out for his father, Edwin: a study of how different wavelengths of light affect a mold that grows in horse manure.

""We went around Staten Island,"" he said. ""There were people who had horses, and we would ask them if we could take some of their manure.""

During summers, the Klibaner family would pack up their car and head across the country for epic camping trips to national parks. And that's when Michael really seemed to be in his element.

""We were always at the back of the pack, and Michael and his sister, Alyssa, were always at the front of the pack with the rangers, and he was always asking questions,"" said Klibaner's mother, Roberta. ""He always needed to know everything.""

So it was no surprise that Klibaner ended up being accepted to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.

Even at a magnet school that attracted so many other science and math prodigies, Klibaner stood out as a student eager to learn more. ""We hung around in the math team circles, and I remember being impressed that he was teaching himself knot theory,"" classmate John Ledwith said.

The resulting project in that befuddling field of advanced mathematics earned him a finalist berth in the prestigious Westinghouse National Science Talent Search.

In high school, Michael seemed to know everyone — including Amy, who at the time was just a friend of a friend. That changed once they bumped into each other again on the Staten Island ferry the summer after they graduated. Their relationship also graduated.

""We just sort of saw each other as different people once we started getting a chance to know each other,"" Amy said.

In 1994, Klibaner graduated from Princeton University, where he majored in applied mathematics and in which he kept a lifelong school pride.

After graduation, Klibaner began a career in finance before finding a niche consulting for dotcoms. A year after they were married, the couple moved to Shanghai. Klibaner, who could start up a conversation with anybody on almost any topic, had made a good enough first impression with a guest at a friend's wedding to get a job offer at the reception.

Two years later, he was hired by the Asia Pacific office of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., a real estate company, where he rose to be the head of research for Greater China.

""He was a natural coach and mentor to the staff, which is a strong quality, particularly in China, where at the time we had a very young local workforce who were eager to learn,"" said Klibaner's boss for five years, Anthony Couse, the CEO of the company's Asia Pacific office.

One of Klibaner's favorite interview questions for the young workforce: How many cows are there in all of China? He didn't care about the answer; it was all about the reasoning.

""Michael was also not shy of the media,"" Couse said. ""I could always count on him to take on the tough TV interviews at 5 a.m.""

Klibaner's lifelong love of talking kept him in demand as an expert on Asian real estate on Western outlets like Bloomberg and CNBC.

Sidney was born in 2011, and the family moved to Hong Kong two years later.

In Asia, the family had the opportunity to indulge in Klibaner's biggest passion — traveling all across the continent and beyond. Instead of a tent in a national park, however, he opted for a wine house in Capetown, South Africa.

Klibaner kept other hobbies. He may have outgrown baseball cards, but he stayed very much a collector. He kept elaborate databases that required a degree in advanced mathematics to decipher — whether they cataloged fancy bourbon, contemporary Chinese art or even the movies he watched.

He also loved to debate politics, and he found a lot about President Donald Trump to argue about. ""He knew something about everything in the world,"" his mother said. ""And if you read his Facebook postings, you know had an opinion on every single thing.""

By the summer of 2019, Klibaner was between jobs when he attended his 25th-year college reunion. Being so close to their families made Klibaner and his wife consider moving back. They did so that August.

While they were here, Klibaner looked forward to passing on his own love of learning to his daughter.

""When we moved back to New York, we got family memberships to the zoos, the museums and stuff like that,"" Amy said. ""And so we were really looking forward to taking advantage of all the cultural institutions here.""

They didn't get much of a chance before Michael got sick.

Then everything changed.

These days, his sister, Alyssa Geibel, comforts herself watching YouTube clips of the media interviews Klibaner did in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

""Just to see him alive and well and doing his job brings tears of happiness,"" Geibel said. ""I'm like, 'Oh, that's my brother.'""

There's no mathematical formula for how to handle the grief — even almost 10 months later.

""I often find myself bogged down with focusing on the loss,"" Amy said, ""and forget to remember the quirks that made Mike who he was.""",MSNBC,"['later', 'finds', 'klibaners', 'michael', 'loss', 'unexpected', 'know', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'science', 'school', 'theres', 'grieving', 'wife', 'amy', 'klibaner', 'family']",0
2021-02-09 03:46:05+00:00,52,"WASHINGTON — Democrats appear to have abandoned hope of getting any Republican support for the next round of Covid-19 relief and, instead of entertaining talks to shrink the president's $1.9 trillion proposal, are determined to go big.

An addition to President Joe Biden's plan is coming from Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chair of the Ways and Means Committee and a key figure in crafting the bill, who wants to add monthly cash payments totaling $3,600 per year for every child under age 6, or $3,000 for children from 6 to 17.

Democrats have been yearning to act boldly on coronavirus aid, haunted by what-ifs from 2009, when they passed a pared-down stimulus package in the wake of the financial collapse, only to suffer for it as a slow recovery led to a bruising midterm election defeat in 2010.

Biden has sought to pave the way for the new approach by arguing that borrowing rates are low and that now isn't the time to fear red ink.

The concept of a child allowance has been percolating in progressive policy circles for years. The Center for American Progress, a liberal group, made a case for it in 2015. In 2017, dozens of Democrats got behind a bill called the American Family Act, which resembles the contours of the new Neal plan. A recent study by Columbia University found that it would reduce child poverty by 42 percent.

Nearly 11 million children in the U.S. — about 1 in 7 — are living in poverty, according to a paper by the center last month. It ranks as one of the highest rates of child poverty in the developed world.

""The era of small government is over. The era of small deficits is over. We are all Keynesians now,"" said Sean McElwee, who co-founded and runs the left-leaning group Data For Progress.

McElwee said it's good policy and good politics for Democrats to embrace aggressive — and expensive — economic policies that resemble the New Deal.

Prominent figures in the party agree.

""At the end of the day, the American people want results. They are hurting,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the chairman of the Budget Committee. ""And overwhelming numbers of the American people know that we have to deal with the health crisis, the pandemic, the economic crisis, the education crisis. That's what they want us to do, and that's what we will do.""

Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the center, said the child allowance would address a flaw in the existing Child Tax Credit, which is only partly refundable. While the cost may be high, he argued that if Congress establishes the program for one year in a reconciliation bill, ""there will be lots of political pressure to make it permanent.""

""The ACA — Biden called that a 'big f---ing deal,' and I think this is of the same magnitude in terms of investment in children,"" Hanlon said, referring to the Affordable Care Act. ""This is a really historic step forward in combating poverty.""

A return to New Deal-style governance

For Democrats, the aggressive approach is a sea change after decades of echoing Republicans about the risks of a rising national debt.

The party pivoted away from a deficit-financed safety net after it suffered crushing defeats to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s as he rallied the country behind a vision of smaller government. Bill Clinton acceded to that view in 1996 when he declared that ""the era of big government is over,"" and the philosophy carried through the Obama White House, which put a premium on deficit reduction amid heavy pressure from conservatives, to avoid being seen as too far left.

Now, after decades of rising income inequality and during a pandemic that has ravaged millions of Americans financially, Democrats are betting the public appetite for government programs has grown.

Some, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., say they made a mistake in 2009 by doing too little in response to the economic crisis.

McElwee said Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's first chief of staff, ""came up with this arbitrary thing where, if it's over a trillion, it's a problem. And now we've blown past that.""

He added, ""Joe Biden understands that whether or not he has political capital a year from now is going to be determined exclusively by is the coronavirus relief working and are people getting back to work?""

Biden's $1.9 trillion package includes $1,400 direct payments and $400-a-week jobless aid, plus vaccine funds, health care subsidies and money for rent, food stamps and public transit. His advisers have circulated surveys showing broad public support, including a recent Quinnipiac poll that showed 68 percent of U.S. adults favor it, while 24 percent oppose it.

Republican lawmakers broadly reject the plan, saying the president hasn't justified the need for so much spending. But some Republicans have softened their hard-nosed message on cutting the safety net to reduce the debt.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., recently teamed up with Sanders to push for $2,000 direct payments. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, last week unveiled a plan to replace the Child Tax Credit with a more generous monthly payment to parents of $350 for young children and $250 for school-age kids. Romney's plan would be funded by cutting other programs that Democrats want to preserve.

A realignment in party coalitions is fueling the shift. Affluent suburbanites are breaking away from the GOP and making it more reliant on white voters without college degrees — a centerpiece of the New Deal Democratic coalition — who would benefit from a larger safety net.

""American families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low,"" said Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. ""Now is the time to renew our commitment to families to help them meet the challenges they face as they take on the most important work any of us will ever do — raising our society’s children.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'democrats', 'relief', 'small', 'package', 'children', 'trillion', 'cash', 'plan', 'child', 'rates', 'era', 'safety', 'american', 'public', 'upsize', 'covid']",0
2021-02-09 02:32:06+00:00,63,"States are rolling back Covid-19 restrictions as new cases trend down from record highs across the country. But experts warn it might be too much too soon as variants pose an increased risk and the pandemic — almost at the one year mark in the U.S. — is far from over.

In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, lifted the state’s partial mask mandate on Friday. She also said businesses no longer have to limit the number of customers or enforce social distancing, and no limits remain on the size of public gatherings. The Des Moines Register's editorial board called the move “inexplicable and irresponsible.”

Reynolds isn’t acting alone. Democratic and Republican governors alike have been loosening restrictions. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, announced Monday that New York City will allow indoor dining beginning on Friday, a few days earlier than originally planned, and middle schools will reopen for in-person instruction on Feb 25. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, said restaurants are allowed to operate at 40 percent capacity as of Monday, citing a decline in hospitalizations as part of his reasoning.

The moves to eliminate virus-related restrictions come as the most-recent seven-day average for new cases in the U.S. is 119,509 for the past week, according to an NBC News analysis. The last time that figure was that low was Nov. 9, near the beginning of the latest surge. The current new case numbers still far surpass the spring and summer highs.

“I have some concern it’s premature” to loosen restrictions, said Dr. Justin Lessler, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Lessler said the very restrictions in place are what is allowing Covid-19 infection rates to decline.

“When we remove interventions, we frequently see resurgences,” he said, advising caution if states want to see continued decline. “When new variants come along, the stepping back that may have been OK before is not OK anymore because of the more transmissible variants.”

The CDC has reported fewer than 700 cases of the various strains of Covid-19 that have entered the country after first being identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Lessler said that number is “very much the tip of the iceberg” and hardly portrays the scope of their spread.

“The variants are here and circulating,” said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health in New York.

While much remains unknown about how the variants will spread and affect the U.S., their presence is undeniable.

Lighter said the U.S. isn’t doing enough “surveillance protecting” or sequencing to test how many of the recent positive cases are coming from the new strains. Still, she said, the surge that some anticipated from more transmissible variants has yet to materialize.

Reversing a mask mandate, she said, makes no sense, but moves like Los Angeles County’s to reopen outdoor dining at the end of January are sensible when being outdoors decreases the risk associated with contracting the virus.

To stay ahead of the variants, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday that it is crucial that people get both doses of the vaccine.

The boost from the second dose gives a ""greater breadth of response,"" said Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, meaning it can protect against the ""wild type"" of coronavirus circulating, including the variants.",MSNBC,"['republican', 'states', 'covid19', 'york', 'unknown', 'experts', 'gov', 'restrictions', 'impact', 'lift', 'dr', 'cases', 'variants', 'infectious', 'despite', 'caution']",0
2021-02-09 02:12:02+00:00,98,"Hospitals in Washington state discovered their supply of N95 masks contained counterfeits after 3M, a company that manufactures the masks, said on Saturday at least some of the vital stockpile for Covid-19 frontline workers were fakes.

The Washington State Hospital Association (WSHA) said 3M notified them about possible knock-off masks circulating in the national supply of personal protective equipment. The association then asked hospitals on Friday to pull the masks from their inventory.

WSHA sent samples to 3M’s fraud department where the company confirmed some of the masks were counterfeit, according to a statement from the hospital association.

""It's a stunning feeling… Just to think that there are people that will do that — out manufacturing counterfeit personal protective equipment that we need right now so badly during this pandemic,” Cassie Sauer, the hospital association president and CEO, told NBC News affiliate KING5.

While the group has yet to confirm the number of knock-offs, they purchased 300,000 masks from a believed third party supplier of personal protective equipment, which added up to about $1.4 million. Of the hundreds of thousands of masks purchased, 60,000 were not distributed.

Sauer said all of the masks had “appropriate paperwork” and passed “physical inspection” and “testing.”

“These N95s are precious resources we need to keep staff safe. It is reprehensible that counterfeiters are selling fake goods,” Sauer said.

3M has flagged several lot numbers, located on the individual masks and the boxes they were shipped in, potentially used by counterfeiters. According to WSHA, some of the lot numbers were among the stock purchased by Washington State hospitals and the hospital association.

The group said that they are waiting on 3M’s investigation into the remaining lot numbers. So far, dozens of hospitals in Washington state have been impacted.

2021-02-09 01:03:04+00:00,59,"MISSION, Kan. — Mortuary owner Brian Simmons has been making more trips to homes to pick up bodies to be cremated and embalmed since the pandemic hit.

With Covid-19 devastating communities in Missouri, his two-person crews regularly arrive at homes in the Springfield area and remove bodies of people who decided to die at home rather than spend their final days in a nursing home or hospital where family visitations were prohibited during the pandemic.

He understands all too well why people are choosing to die at home: His own 49-year-old daughter succumbed to the coronavirus just before Christmas at a Springfield hospital, where the family only got phone updates as her condition deteriorated.

“The separation part is really rough, rough rough,” said Simmons. “My daughter went to the hospital and we saw her once through the glass when they put her on the ventilator, and then we never saw her again until after she died.”

Across the country, terminally ill patients — both with Covid-19 and other diseases — are making similar decisions and dying at home rather than face the terrifying scenario of saying farewell to loved ones behind glass or during video calls.

“What we are seeing with Covid is certainly patients want to stay at home,” said Judi Lund Person, the vice president for regulatory compliance at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. “They don’t want to go to the hospital. They don’t want to go to a nursing home.""

National hospice organizations are reporting that facilities are seeing double-digit percentage increases in the number of patients being cared for at home.

The phenomenon has played out Carroll Hospice in Westminster, Maryland, which has seen a 30 percent to 40 percent spike in demand for home-based care, said executive director Regina Bodnar. She said avoiding nursing homes and coronavirus risks are the biggest factor behind the increase.”

Lisa Kossoudji, who supervises nurses at Ohio’s Hospice of Dayton, pulled her own mother, now 95, out of assisted living and brought her home to live with her after the pandemic hit. She had gone weeks without seeing her mother and was worried that her condition was deteriorating because she was being restricted to her room as the facility sought to limit the potential for the virus to spread.

Her mother, who has a condition that causes thickening and hardening of the walls of the arteries in her brain, is now receiving hospice services. Kossoudji is seeing the families she serves make similar choices.

“Lots of people are bringing folks home that physically, they have a lot physical issues, whether it is they have a feeding tube or a trachea, things that an everyday lay person would look at and say, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t do this,’” she said. “But yet they are willing to bring them home because we want to be able to be with them and see them.”

Before the pandemic, hospice workers cared for patients dying of heart disease, cancer, dementia and other terminal illnesses in long-term care facilities and, to a lesser extent, home settings. Many families hesitated to go the die-at-home route because of the many logistical challenges, including work schedules and complicated medical needs.

But the pandemic changed things. People were suddenly working from home and had more time, and they were more comfortable with home hospice knowing the alternative with lack of visitation at nursing homes.

“What happened with Covid is everything was on steroids so to speak. Everything happened so quickly that all of a sudden family members were prepared to care for their loved ones at home,” said Carole Fisher, president of the National Partnership for Healthcare and Hospice Innovation. “Everything accelerated.”

“I have heard families say, ‘I can care for my aged mother now very differently than I could before because I am working from home,’” she added. “And so there is more of a togetherness in the family unit because of Covid.”

Dying at home isn't for everyone, however. Caring for the needs of a critically ill relative can mean sleepless nights and added stress as the pandemic rages.

Karen Rubel recalled that she didn’t want to take her own 81-year-old mother to the hospital when she had a stroke in September and then pushed hard to bring her home as soon as possible.

The loss was so sudden, so devastating, that it's only 10 months later that his family can speak about it. It's only now that this reporter could bring himself to ask the questions.

His daughter, Sidney, who will turn 10 in June, likes to look at a photograph from her infancy in Shanghai in which she is propped up on her father's lap, one hand grasping for his bowl of noodles ""to steal his food,"" as she puts it. The picture reminds her of her dad's smile. He smiled a lot.

""My favorite moment with him is when we swam together because we would race and I would always win, but sometimes I would let him,"" she said by email.

Born May 7, 1972, in Brooklyn, Klibaner was destined for a life of learning as the son of two science teachers.

In some ways, he grew up a regular suburban kid on Staten Island, riding his bike, watching baseball and collecting trading cards. Less typical were his elaborate science projects in middle school. One first-place project that particularly stands out for his father, Edwin: a study of how different wavelengths of light affect a mold that grows in horse manure.

""We went around Staten Island,"" he said. ""There were people who had horses, and we would ask them if we could take some of their manure.""

During summers, the Klibaner family would pack up their car and head across the country for epic camping trips to national parks. And that's when Michael really seemed to be in his element.

""We were always at the back of the pack, and Michael and his sister, Alyssa, were always at the front of the pack with the rangers, and he was always asking questions,"" said Klibaner's mother, Roberta. ""He always needed to know everything.""

So it was no surprise that Klibaner ended up being accepted to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.

Even at a magnet school that attracted so many other science and math prodigies, Klibaner stood out as a student eager to learn more. ""We hung around in the math team circles, and I remember being impressed that he was teaching himself knot theory,"" classmate John Ledwith said.

The resulting project in that befuddling field of advanced mathematics earned him a finalist berth in the prestigious Westinghouse National Science Talent Search.

In high school, Michael seemed to know everyone — including Amy, who at the time was just a friend of a friend. That changed once they bumped into each other again on the Staten Island ferry the summer after they graduated. Their relationship also graduated.

""We just sort of saw each other as different people once we started getting a chance to know each other,"" Amy said.

In 1994, Klibaner graduated from Princeton University, where he majored in applied mathematics and in which he kept a lifelong school pride.

After graduation, Klibaner began a career in finance before finding a niche consulting for dotcoms. A year after they were married, the couple moved to Shanghai. Klibaner, who could start up a conversation with anybody on almost any topic, had made a good enough first impression with a guest at a friend's wedding to get a job offer at the reception.

Two years later, he was hired by the Asia Pacific office of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., a real estate company, where he rose to be the head of research for Greater China.

""He was a natural coach and mentor to the staff, which is a strong quality, particularly in China, where at the time we had a very young local workforce who were eager to learn,"" said Klibaner's boss for five years, Anthony Couse, the CEO of the company's Asia Pacific office.

One of Klibaner's favorite interview questions for the young workforce: How many cows are there in all of China? He didn't care about the answer; it was all about the reasoning.

""Michael was also not shy of the media,"" Couse said. ""I could always count on him to take on the tough TV interviews at 5 a.m.""

Klibaner's lifelong love of talking kept him in demand as an expert on Asian real estate on Western outlets like Bloomberg and CNBC.

Sidney was born in 2011, and the family moved to Hong Kong two years later.

In Asia, the family had the opportunity to indulge in Klibaner's biggest passion — traveling all across the continent and beyond. Instead of a tent in a national park, however, he opted for a wine house in Capetown, South Africa.

Klibaner kept other hobbies. He may have outgrown baseball cards, but he stayed very much a collector. He kept elaborate databases that required a degree in advanced mathematics to decipher — whether they cataloged fancy bourbon, contemporary Chinese art or even the movies he watched.

He also loved to debate politics, and he found a lot about President Donald Trump to argue about. ""He knew something about everything in the world,"" his mother said. ""And if you read his Facebook postings, you know had an opinion on every single thing.""

By the summer of 2019, Klibaner was between jobs when he attended his 25th-year college reunion. Being so close to their families made Klibaner and his wife consider moving back. They did so that August.

While they were here, Klibaner looked forward to passing on his own love of learning to his daughter.

""When we moved back to New York, we got family memberships to the zoos, the museums and stuff like that,"" Amy said. ""And so we were really looking forward to taking advantage of all the cultural institutions here.""

They didn't get much of a chance before Michael got sick.

Then everything changed.

These days, his sister, Alyssa Geibel, comforts herself watching YouTube clips of the media interviews Klibaner did in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

""Just to see him alive and well and doing his job brings tears of happiness,"" Geibel said. ""I'm like, 'Oh, that's my brother.'""

There's no mathematical formula for how to handle the grief — even almost 10 months later.

""I often find myself bogged down with focusing on the loss,"" Amy said, ""and forget to remember the quirks that made Mike who he was.""",MSNBC,"['later', 'finds', 'klibaners', 'michael', 'loss', 'unexpected', 'know', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'science', 'school', 'theres', 'grieving', 'wife', 'amy', 'klibaner', 'family']",0

2021-02-08 20:40:05+00:00,63,"WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress have begun to utilize an arcane process known as reconciliation to fast-track President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.

Most importantly, the measure allows them to circumvent the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which would otherwise require them to get Republican support. As the U.S. economy continues to reel from the crisis, Biden and many Democrats say Americans are less concerned about process and more so about delivering relief.

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

""Nobody in my state knows what the hell reconciliation is. They believe that Joe Biden said, ‘If we win Georgia, we’re getting $2,000 checks.’ And we won Georgia. So we have an obligation to follow through,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told NBC News.

Here are some questions and answers on how the process works.

What is reconciliation?

Senate rules require that most pieces of legislation get 60 votes, which under the current Senate would mean all of the Democrats and 10 Republicans.

But ""reconciliation"" is a process created under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that allows a simple majority to pass certain types of legislation. It was set up to allow lawmakers to change policy on spending or taxes to keep the nation's budget in line.

Isn't that abnormal?

Not really. It has been used by Congress during the last four presidential administrations, when the same party controlled the legislative branch and the White House.

Reconciliation was used during Donald Trump's and George W. Bush's presidencies to cut taxes. While Barack Obama was in office, Congress used it to pass parts of the Affordable Care Act. During Bill Clinton's administration, it was used it to raise taxes. There have also been bipartisan reconciliation bills passed under divided government.

So Democrats can pass a bill without Republicans?

Because the current Senate is split 50-50 and the vice president, who casts the tiebreaking vote, is a Democrat, then a bill created through reconciliation could pass without any Republican support.

Then why don't Senate leaders use it all the time?

There are limitations. The process is only permitted once per fiscal year, and it can only be used to change — or ""reconcile"" — laws related to taxes and spending.

So how does the process work?

The Senate and House both passed the budget resolution, instructing committees to craft the reconciliation legislation, which can evade the Senate filibuster.

What if the bill increases the deficit?

The reconciliation rules allow bills that raise the deficit, but only for 10 years. Laws that the Congressional Budget Office determines will raise the deficit outside the 10-year window are not eligible. This is why some items passed through reconciliation, like Trump's individual tax cuts, were made to be temporary.

Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., reads his opening statement during the markup of a bill on May 15, 2008. Scott J. Ferrell / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images

What is the Byrd rule?

It's a law named after former Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., that allows a provision to be removed from a reconciliation bill if a senator objects and it is deemed ""extraneous"" to the budget. It basically makes sure no unrelated provisions can be snuck into the bill. The Senate parliamentarian is tasked with deciding what is and isn't ""extraneous.""

What if it's not exactly a new tax or spending item but affects the budget?

There are some gray areas. If there's a dispute, the Senate parliamentarian would settle it. In theory, a majority of senators could overrule the parliamentarian, but that would be unusual.

Why do senators keep saying the phrase 'Byrd bath'?

That's an insider-y term for the process of cleansing the reconciliation bill of provisions that don't comply with the Byrd rule.

Can $1,400 checks and jobless benefits pass in this process?

Yes, policies like those are clearly budgetary and shouldn't have a problem passing through reconciliation. Those are core components of the Democratic virus relief effort.

What's an example of a policy that can't pass?

Regulatory measures, such as gun control or rewriting immigration rules, are likely to run afoul of the Byrd rule and therefore cannot pass under this process.

Can the minimum wage be raised in reconciliation?

There's some dispute about this. Many budget experts believe that would be regulatory and can't be passed under reconciliation. But some, like incoming Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., take a more expansive view of the process and say it can be used.",MSNBC,"['reconciliation', 'fasttrack', 'bill', 'used', 'relief', 'passed', 'process', 'byrd', 'senate', 'pass', 'taxes', 'budget', 'covid', 'explainer']",0

2021-02-08 18:32:06+00:00,34,"JOHANNESBURG — South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its front-line health care workers with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested that it isn't effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in the country.

South Africa got its first 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last week and was expected to begin giving shots to health care workers in mid-February. The disappointing early results indicate that an inoculation drive using the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful.

Preliminary data from a small study suggested that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers only ""minimal protection against mild-moderate disease"" caused by the variant in South Africa. The variant appears to be more infectious, and it is driving a deadly resurgence of the disease in the country, accounting for more than 90 percent of the Covid-19 cases, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said Sunday night.

""The AstraZeneca vaccine appeared effective against the original strain but not against the variant,"" Mkhize said. ""We have decided to put a temporary hold on the rollout of the vaccine. ... More work needs to be done.""

The study, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, involved 2,000 people, most of whom were young and healthy. The volunteers' average age was 31.

""Protection against moderate-severe disease, hospitalization or death could not be assessed in this study as the target population were at such low risk,"" said a statement issued by Oxford University and the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

Scientists will study whether the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the variant to prevent death and severe disease, Mkhize said. Other vaccines have been less effective against the variant, but they have provided good protection against death and serious disease.

Public health officials are concerned about the South African variant because it includes a mutation of the coronavirus's characteristic spike protein, which is targeted by existing vaccines. South African officials say the variant is more contagious, and evidence is emerging that it may be more virulent.

South Africa will urgently roll out other vaccines to inoculate as many people as possible in the coming months, Mkhize said. Other South African scientists said Sunday that clinical trials for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine show good results against the variant.

The early results for the AstraZeneca vaccine against the variant could have far-reaching implications, as many other countries in Africa and beyond have been planning to use the AstraZeneca shot. The international COVAX initiative has bought the AstraZeneca vaccine in bulk from the Serum Institute of India.

Developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine expect to have a modified shot to cope with the South African coronavirus variant by autumn, the vaccine's lead researcher, Sarah Gilbert, told the BBC on Sunday.

Authorities in England last week went house to house to test for Covid-19 in eight areas where the South African variant is believed to be spreading after a handful of cases were found in people who had had no contact with the country or anyone who had traveled there.

More than 100 cases of the South African variant have been found in the U.K. The testing blitz is a bid to snuff out the variant before it spreads widely and undermines the U.K.'s vaccination rollout.

Britain has had Europe's deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 112,000 confirmed deaths, and it has embarked on a speedier vaccination plan than the neighboring European Union. So far, the U.K. has given first vaccine shots to about 11.5 million people.",MSNBC,"['variant', 'astrazeneca', 'questions', 'health', 'effectiveness', 'study', 'african', 'vaccines', 'south', 'halts', 'vaccine', 'africa', 'mkhize']",0

2021-02-08 14:56:10+00:00,84,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats on Monday will unveil a proposed addition to the developing coronavirus relief package that would provide up to $3,600 per child to families over the course of the year.

The IRS would distribute the money monthly, totaling $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17, based on a tax filers’ income, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., said Monday previewing the plan. NBC News also obtained a draft copy of the proposal.

""Treasury would just issue a check for $300 a month, for example, to the eligible income families, and I think that that would provide greater liquidity assurance and as I said earlier simultaneously create demand,"" Neal said at a press conference alongside his state's Republican governor, Charlie Baker.

Neal explained that implementation might be complicated and likely would require investing money in technology improvements for the IRS and Treasury Department.

The plan was first reported by The Washington Post.

The money would begin to be distributed in July if the proposal is included in the Covid-19 relief measure that Democrats in the House and Senate are currently considering. Neal said the Ways and Means Committee plans consider the Covid-19 relief on Wednesday morning and he hopes to have the bill through Congress by mid-March.

“The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it’s devastating. We are making the Child Tax Credit more generous, more accessible, and by paying it out monthly, this money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone’s head or food on their table,” Neal said in a statement provided to NBC News.

He added, “This is how the tax code is supposed to work for those who need it most, and so long as I am Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, it’s what you can expect to see from us.”

Senate Democrats and the White House have expressed support for the plan, an aide said.

This comes as Democrats in both chambers accelerated the process last week to pass an overall aid package. President Joe Biden and top Democrats made clear that they are prepared to pass the bill without the support of Republicans. The legislation would include $1,400 direct checks to people based on income level. It would also provide boosted benefits for the unemployed and fund the effort to quickly vaccinate people across the country.",MSNBC,"['bill', 'democrats', 'tax', 'relief', 'provide', '3600', 'neal', 'ways', 'plan', 'child', 'credits', 'money', 'covid', 'means']",0
2021-02-08 14:32:06+00:00,61,"DETROIT — Kinda Makini-Anderson has been providing hot meals to households on Detroit's east side throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. By her count, Makini-Anderson's nonprofit Inner City Youth Group has provided over 150,000 meals in the last 10 months.

""We have always been there since 2009, assisting the community,"" she said on a recent snowy morning after delivering breakfast to a local family. ""But since the pandemic, it's been an overload.""

For the vast majority of the families she helps feed, however, these meals are not the only support they rely on to keep afloat. Makini-Anderson estimates that 98 percent of the households she serves are already getting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits — the government assistance program formerly known as food stamps. But the benefits provided by the nation's most important program for the hungry are simply not enough.

Experts and advocates say the pandemic has exposed a system that is outdated and inadequate.

Joseph Llobrera, director of research for the food assistance team at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank in Washington, said research shows SNAP isn't doing job No. 1: feeding the hungry. ""People run out of benefits two to three weeks into the month,"" he said.

Food relief organizations — from small church pantries and major regional food banks to organizations like Makini-Anderson's — have been shouldering a two-fold burden since the pandemic began: supporting the millions of Americans newly facing food insecurity, who don't participate in or don't qualify for SNAP, while also serving those already receiving assistance that doesn't get them through the month.

Before the pandemic, the average SNAP benefit was about $1.40 per person, per meal. During the pandemic, everyone on SNAP was bumped up to the maximum benefit of $2 per meal, but the families already at the maximum, those most in need, weren't given any additional funds.

Last month, the Biden administration challenged the Agriculture Department, which manages SNAP, to fix that but also to take an earlier-than-planned look at the basis for the benefit itself. Maximum benefit levels for SNAP are dictated by something called the ""Thrifty Food Plan,"" which is supposed to reflect the minimum cost of a nutritious diet.

But the Thrifty Food Plan hasn't been revised since 2006 and hasn't been dramatically reassessed since the 1970s, only increasing in line with inflation throughout the years. The plan wasn't due for reassessment for another two years.

""The Thrifty Food Plan is based on the assumption that people have a lot of time to price-shop and prepare meals from scratch, but the reality is that many families are juggling different jobs,"" Llobrera said. ""Building a food plan that assumes you're going to soak beans overnight rather than using canned beans — how realistic is that?"" Llobrera said the plan is also based on an outdated assumption that people spend the majority of their income on food, when in reality, most people now spend the biggest chunk of their paychecks on housing.

In the meantime, food banks have filled the gap.

""We've been at this for, what, 10, 11 months? And unfortunately, we have not seen a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Brian Barks, president and CEO of Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

When the pandemic began, NBC News reported that Barks' food bank had been so inundated by requests for assistance in applying for SNAP benefits that it had a backlog. Eventually, the food bank had to take down its advertisements about its SNAP assistance program because it was simply getting too many calls to handle.

""We would get such a huge call volume that with our limited staff, we just had no ability to keep up,"" Barks explained.

But the amount of food they had to purchase to keep up with the need went up, and up, and up. It went from $80,000 per month before the pandemic to a staggering $1.5 million that the food bank now spends each month to feed the pantries — and the people — that rely on them.

""There are some serious questions that Americans are asking themselves every day. 'Do I get the medicine that I need or do I buy food? Do I pay the electric bill or do I buy food?' The people who are in that gap that don't qualify for SNAP benefits, and those who do and still need food assistance, that's a big gap,"" he said.

Barks' food bank is not unique in this regard. Across the country at Feeding San Diego, which serves San Diego County and surrounding areas, 700,000 more meals are being distributed every month compared to the same time last year.

Barks said the changes to SNAP announced by the Biden administration last month have him feeling hopeful.

""SNAP is a political football. It always has been,"" he said, ""But it is a key, essential tool that every food bank needs in order to do the work that we do. We need help from the federal government, the state and local governments, to do this work. People who are waiting for food banks to solve the food insecurity problem in our country, we're not going to do it.""

In fact, the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks, of which both Food Bank for the Heartland and Feeding San Diego are members, conducted a study showing that for every meal provided by one of their food banks, SNAP can provide nine.

That's concerning for people like Makini-Anderson in Detroit, who often see struggling families that don't qualify for the boost that SNAP benefits provide.

Families like Barry Chambliss and Melissa Michaux's: With five kids under age 10 and dramatic losses to their income during the pandemic, Chambliss and Michaux have been scraping by. But when they applied for SNAP in the spring, they were denied.

""On the last denial that I've gotten, it said that I need to turn in verifications of end of employment for jobs that Barry hasn't had in years,"" Michaux said.

Efforts to challenge that decision and get in touch with a case worker led to unanswered phone calls and frustration, the couple said.

""People used to be able to go inside the office and actually complete the actual application, and they can have assistance with that,"" Makini-Anderson noted. Now ""it's hard for them to even navigate through their phone to complete this application.""

It's something Stacy Dean, the new deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the Agriculture Department, is acutely aware of.

""This is what in my new job is keeping me up at night, is who are we missing?"" Dean said. ""The process of applying for SNAP benefits is tough. It's incredibly rigorous. And trying to carry that out in a remote environment has made it, I think, a little bit more difficult both for the states who are running the program and the people who need the benefits.""

The cost of administering SNAP is split between states and the federal government, but as 6 million more people in America were added to the SNAP rolls last year, many states were essentially being asked to do more with the same or fewer resources and to do it all remotely.

""One of the things we want to do is ease up on some of the rules to make it easier for states to run the program,"" Dean said.

She acknowledged that food banks have stepped up. ""They can meet an emergency need very quickly,"" Dean said. ""Unfortunately, in this environment, they have been asked to do so much more, which is to provide food for longer periods of time and to supplement the federal food programs.""

For those who help meet the need, that's foreboding. After the Great Recession in 2008, it took a decade for food insecurity to fall back to previous levels.

""It is taking every ounce of energy that we have in order to try to help those people who have been added to the rolls of those who are now food insecure,"" Barks said. ""Anything, anything that can be done to alleviate the pressure that food banks are facing, to purchase and distribute food will benefit the hunger relief organizations in a positive way.""

Back in Detroit, things are looking up for Chambliss and Michaux. When reached for comment, a spokesperson from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said the agency couldn't comment on the particulars of Chambliss and Michaux's case due to confidentiality requirements. But since a ""Nightly News"" story aired this month focusing on the couple and their children, Makini-Anderson said the agency has reached out to the family offering to provide help.

And what we're going to do is say that everybody, a single person, individual $75,000 or lower, and a couple of $150,000 or lower, will be eligible for that full $2,000, $600 plus $1,400.

""Now, when people said, 'We don't want rich people to get that benefit,' I understand that. I agree,"" Sanders continued. ""But to say to a worker in Vermont or California or any place else that, if you're making $52,000 a year, you are too rich to get this help, the full benefit, I think that that's absurd.""

Senate Democrats are split over who should be eligible for a new round of checks as they seek to pass a new stimulus package. The last round of checks was cut off for people making more than $99,000 or couples who made above $198,000. In his initial proposal, Biden recommended the same threshold.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., last week offered a nonbinding amendment backed by some other Democrats to ""ensure upper-income taxpayers are not eligible"" for the checks. Manchin wants to phase out the stimulus checks beginning at $50,000 per person or $100,000 per couple, rather than at $75,000 and $150,000.

Biden also opened the door to adjusting the income levels Wednesday in a call with Democrats.

Speaking on ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Biden thinks it's appropriate for those making more than $50,000 to get the full benefit. She didn't say whether sentiment extends up to $75,000.

""Well, President Biden is certainly willing to work with members of Congress to define what's fair,"" she said. ""And he wouldn't want to see a household making over $300,000 receive these payments. But if you think about an elementary school teacher or a policeman making $60,000 a year and faced with children who are out of school and people who may have had to withdraw from the labor force in order to take care of them and many extra burdens, I would — he thinks, and I would certainly agree — that it's appropriate for people there to get support.""

In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pressed for immediate action when asked whether it's worth it to lower the threshold if it means passing the bill sooner.

""Look, there's an active conversation going on right now, obviously, but the bottom line is we've got to support as many Americans as we can as robustly as we can and as quickly as we can,"" he said.

2021-02-08 11:31:01+00:00,83,"As U.S. Covid-19 cases drop and the vaccine rollout continues, Dr. Fauci shares reasons for both optimism and concern, emphasizing that vaccines and CDC protocols work to curb the spread, while reacting to warnings from some experts that new strains of Covid could be literally worse than the coronavirus that ravaged the world in 2020. This is an excerpt from an interview with MSNBC’s Ari Melber.Feb. 6, 2021",MSNBC,"['rollout', 'alarm', '2020', 'covid19', 'world', 'warnings', '2021', 'shares', 'dr', 'vaccines', 'spread', 'worse', 'vaccine', 'fauci', 'strains', 'work']",0
2021-02-08 10:32:01+00:00,87,"Kaitlyn Romoser first caught Covid-19 in March, likely on a trip to Denmark and Sweden, just as the scope of the pandemic was becoming clear. Romoser, who is 23 and a laboratory researcher in College Station, Texas, tested positive and had a few days of mild, coldlike symptoms.

In the weeks that followed, she bounced back to what felt like a full recovery. She even got another test, which was negative, in order to join a study as one of the earliest donors of convalescent blood plasma in a bid to help others.

Six months later, in September, Romoser got sick again, after a trip to Florida with her dad. This second bout was much worse. She lost her sense of taste and smell and suffered lingering headaches and fatigue. She tested positive for Covid-19 once more — along with her cat.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Romoser believes it was a clear case of reinfection, rather than some mysterious reemergence of the original infection gone dormant. Because the coronavirus, like other viruses, regularly mutates as it multiplies and spreads through a community, a new infection would bear a different genetic fingerprint. But because neither lab had saved her testing samples for genetic sequencing, there was no way to confirm her suspicion.

“It would be nice to have proof,” said Romoser. “I’ve literally been straight up called a liar, because people don’t want to believe that it’s possible to be reinfected. Why would I lie about being sick?”

As millions of Americans struggle to recover from Covid-19 and millions more scramble for the protection offered by vaccines, U.S. health officials may be overlooking an unsettling subgroup of survivors: those who get infected more than once. Identifying how common reinfection is among people who contracted Covid-19 — as well as how quickly they become vulnerable and why — carries important implications for our understanding of immunity and the nation’s efforts to devise an effective vaccination program.

Scientists have confirmed that reinfections after initial illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus are possible, but so far have characterized them as rare. Fewer than 50 cases have been substantiated worldwide, according to a global reinfection tracker. Just five have been substantiated in the U.S., including two detected in California in late January.

That sounds like a rather insignificant number. But scientists’ understanding of reinfection has been constrained by the limited number of U.S. labs that retain Covid-19 testing samples or perform genetic sequencing. A KHN review of surveillance efforts finds that many U.S. states aren’t rigorously tracking or investigating suspected cases of reinfection.

I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection.

KHN sent queries about reinfection surveillance to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of 24 responses, fewer than half provided details about suspected or confirmed reinfection cases. Where officials said they’re actively monitoring for reinfection, they have found far more potential cases than previously anticipated.

In Washington state, for instance, health officials are investigating nearly 700 cases that meet the criteria for possible reinfection, with three dozen awaiting genetic sequencing and just one case confirmed.

In Colorado, officials estimate that possible reinfections make up just 0.1 percent of positive coronavirus cases. But with more than 396,000 cases reported, that means nearly 400 people may have been infected more than once.

In Minnesota, officials have investigated more than 150 cases of suspected reinfection, but they lack the genetic material to confirm a diagnosis, a spokesperson said.

In Nevada, where the first U.S. case of Covid-19 reinfection was identified last summer, Mark Pandori, director of the state public health lab, said there’s no doubt cases are going undetected.

“I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection,” he said. “They are very difficult to ascertain, so you need specialized teams to do that work, or a core lab.”

Such cases are different from instances of so-called long-haul Covid-19, in which the original infection triggers debilitating symptoms that linger for months and viral particles can continue to be detected. Reinfection occurs when a person is infected with Covid-19, clears that strain and is infected again with a different strain, raising concerns about sustained immunity from the disease. Such reinfections occur regularly with four other coronaviruses that circulate among humans, causing common colds.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines call for investigating for possible reinfection when someone tests positive for Covid-19 at least 90 days after an original infection (or at least 45 days for “highly suspicious” cases). Confirmation of reinfection requires genetic sequencing of paired samples from each episode to tell whether the genomes involved are different.

But the U.S. lacks the capacity for robust genetic sequencing, the process that identifies the fingerprint of a specific virus so it can be compared with other strains. Jeff Zients, head of the federal Covid task force, noted late last month that the U.S. ranks 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing.

To date, only a fraction of positive coronavirus samples has been sequenced, though the Biden administration is working to rapidly expand the effort. On Feb. 1, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters that sequencing has “increased tenfold” in recent weeks, from 251 sequences the week of Jan. 10 to 2,238 the week of Jan. 24. The agency is working with private companies, states and academic labs to ramp up to 6,000 sequences per week by mid-February.

Washington’s state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, Dr. Scott Lindquist, said officials have prioritized genetic sequencing at the state laboratory, with plans to begin genotyping 5 percent of all samples collected. That will allow officials to sort through those nearly 700 potential reinfections, Lindquist said. More important, the effort will also help signal the presence of significantly mutated forms of the coronavirus, known as variants, that could affect how easily the virus spreads and, perhaps, how sick Covid-19 makes people.

“Those two areas, reinfection and variants, may cross paths,” he said. “We wanted to be in front of it, not behind it.”

How long does immunity last?

The specter of reinfections complicates one of the central questions of the Covid-19 threat: How long after natural infection or vaccination will people remain immune?

Early studies suggested immunity would be short-lived, only a few months, while more recent research finds that certain antibodies and memory cells may persist in Covid-infected patients longer than eight months.

“We actually don’t know” the marker that would signal immunity, said Dr. Jason Goldman, an infectious diseases expert at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. “We don’t have the test you could perform to say yes or no, you could be infected.”

Goldman and colleagues confirmed a case of reinfection in a Seattle man last fall, and since then have identified six or seven probable cases. “This is a much more common scenario than is being recognized,” he said.

The possibility of reinfection means that even patients who’ve had Covid-19 need to remain vigilant about curbing re-exposure, said Dr. Edgar Sanchez, an infectious diseases physician at Orlando Health in Florida.

“A lot of patients ask, ‘How long do I have to worry about getting Covid again?’” he said. “I literally tell them this: ‘You are probably safe for a few weeks, maybe even up to a couple of months, but beyond that, it’s really unclear.’”

The message is similar for the wider society, said Dr. Bill Messer, an expert in viral genetics at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, who has been pondering the cultural psychology of the Covid-19 response. Evidence suggests there may not be a clear-cut return to normal.

“The idea that we will end this pandemic by beating this coronavirus, I don’t think that’s actually the way it’s going to happen,” he said. “I think that it’s more likely that we’re going to learn how to be comfortable living with this new virus circulating among us.”",MSNBC,"['tracking', 'reinfection', 'possible', 'isnt', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'common', 'cases', 'officials', 'samples', 'realized', 'genetic', 'reinfections', 'covid', 'sequencing']",0
2021-02-08 07:32:04+00:00,57,"As Michael Klibaner watched his bride-to-be walk down the aisle in Puerto Rico during their wedding in 2004, he burst into tears.

Klibaner had a reputation for being analytical — especially at the science and math high school where he met both his future wife and this reporter — and logic would dictate that he had seen Amy enough in the 13 years that they dated to maintain his composure.

Only, that large brain was often overshadowed by an even bigger heart.

""Mike was a huge sap,"" said Amy Klibaner, his wife of nearly 17 years. ""He's the guy who would be crying over Hallmark card commercials.""

These days, however, it's everyone else's turn to cry.

Klibaner died of complications from Covid-19 on April 14 — less than a month before he would have turned 48.

What makes the loss more devastating for his family and friends is that he seemed to be recovering from a relatively manageable case of the virus at his home in New York City, relieved not to need an emergency trip to a swamped hospital during the early weeks of the pandemic. When he collapsed in the bathroom of the apartment he shared with his wife and their 9-year-old daughter, he was brushing his teeth to get ready for his first walk outside in two weeks.

He went into cardiac arrest as the paramedics were taking him down the stairs, the result of what would later be determined as a massive pulmonary embolism.

""They took him to the hospital, and I got a call about an hour later that he passed away,"" Amy Klibaner said. ""It was just so unexpected.""

The loss was so sudden, so devastating, that it's only 10 months later that his family can speak about it. It's only now that this reporter could bring himself to ask the questions.

His daughter, Sidney, who will turn 10 in June, likes to look at a photograph from her infancy in Shanghai in which she is propped up on her father's lap, one hand grasping for his bowl of noodles ""to steal his food,"" as she puts it. The picture reminds her of her dad's smile. He smiled a lot.

""My favorite moment with him is when we swam together because we would race and I would always win, but sometimes I would let him,"" she said by email.

Born May 7, 1972, in Brooklyn, Klibaner was destined for a life of learning as the son of two science teachers.

In some ways, he grew up a regular suburban kid on Staten Island, riding his bike, watching baseball and collecting trading cards. Less typical were his elaborate science projects in middle school. One first-place project that particularly stands out for his father, Edwin: a study of how different wavelengths of light affect a mold that grows in horse manure.

""We went around Staten Island,"" he said. ""There were people who had horses, and we would ask them if we could take some of their manure.""

During summers, the Klibaner family would pack up their car and head across the country for epic camping trips to national parks. And that's when Michael really seemed to be in his element.

""We were always at the back of the pack, and Michael and his sister, Alyssa, were always at the front of the pack with the rangers, and he was always asking questions,"" said Klibaner's mother, Roberta. ""He always needed to know everything.""

So it was no surprise that Klibaner ended up being accepted to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.

Even at a magnet school that attracted so many other science and math prodigies, Klibaner stood out as a student eager to learn more. ""We hung around in the math team circles, and I remember being impressed that he was teaching himself knot theory,"" classmate John Ledwith said.

The resulting project in that befuddling field of advanced mathematics earned him a finalist berth in the prestigious Westinghouse National Science Talent Search.

In high school, Michael seemed to know everyone — including Amy, who at the time was just a friend of a friend. That changed once they bumped into each other again on the Staten Island ferry the summer after they graduated. Their relationship also graduated.

""We just sort of saw each other as different people once we started getting a chance to know each other,"" Amy said.

In 1994, Klibaner graduated from Princeton University, where he majored in applied mathematics and in which he kept a lifelong school pride.

After graduation, Klibaner began a career in finance before finding a niche consulting for dotcoms. A year after they were married, the couple moved to Shanghai. Klibaner, who could start up a conversation with anybody on almost any topic, had made a good enough first impression with a guest at a friend's wedding to get a job offer at the reception.

Two years later, he was hired by the Asia Pacific office of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., a real estate company, where he rose to be the head of research for Greater China.

""He was a natural coach and mentor to the staff, which is a strong quality, particularly in China, where at the time we had a very young local workforce who were eager to learn,"" said Klibaner's boss for five years, Anthony Couse, the CEO of the company's Asia Pacific office.

One of Klibaner's favorite interview questions for the young workforce: How many cows are there in all of China? He didn't care about the answer; it was all about the reasoning.

""Michael was also not shy of the media,"" Couse said. ""I could always count on him to take on the tough TV interviews at 5 a.m.""

Klibaner's lifelong love of talking kept him in demand as an expert on Asian real estate on Western outlets like Bloomberg and CNBC.

Sidney was born in 2011, and the family moved to Hong Kong two years later.

In Asia, the family had the opportunity to indulge in Klibaner's biggest passion — traveling all across the continent and beyond. Instead of a tent in a national park, however, he opted for a wine house in Capetown, South Africa.

Klibaner kept other hobbies. He may have outgrown baseball cards, but he stayed very much a collector. He kept elaborate databases that required a degree in advanced mathematics to decipher — whether they cataloged fancy bourbon, contemporary Chinese art or even the movies he watched.

He also loved to debate politics, and he found a lot about President Donald Trump to argue about. ""He knew something about everything in the world,"" his mother said. ""And if you read his Facebook postings, you know had an opinion on every single thing.""

By the summer of 2019, Klibaner was between jobs when he attended his 25th-year college reunion. Being so close to their families made Klibaner and his wife consider moving back. They did so that August.

While they were here, Klibaner looked forward to passing on his own love of learning to his daughter.

""When we moved back to New York, we got family memberships to the zoos, the museums and stuff like that,"" Amy said. ""And so we were really looking forward to taking advantage of all the cultural institutions here.""

They didn't get much of a chance before Michael got sick.

Then everything changed.

These days, his sister, Alyssa Geibel, comforts herself watching YouTube clips of the media interviews Klibaner did in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

""Just to see him alive and well and doing his job brings tears of happiness,"" Geibel said. ""I'm like, 'Oh, that's my brother.'""

There's no mathematical formula for how to handle the grief — even almost 10 months later.

""I often find myself bogged down with focusing on the loss,"" Amy said, ""and forget to remember the quirks that made Mike who he was.""",MSNBC,"['later', 'finds', 'klibaners', 'michael', 'loss', 'unexpected', 'know', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'science', 'school', 'theres', 'grieving', 'wife', 'amy', 'klibaner', 'family']",0

""Now I can teach @soulcycle with a little more faith that we're all gonna be ok if we get the [vaccine],"" Griffith's post read. She told The Daily Beast that her role as an ""educator"" made her eligible to get in the front of the line for a vaccination.

Her post raised questions and sparked outrage. Mayor Bill de Blasio also called out Griffith's vaccination as problematic.

""Doesn't sound like someone who should have gotten vaccinated to me,” he said Sunday at a news conference. ""I don't think someone who shows up and says, 'Hey, I'm a Soul Cycle instructor,' should have qualified unless there's some other factor there. That should have been caught in the application process.”

Initially, Griffith, 52, defended her decision to jump the line and get the Covid-19 jab along with other educators.

""All teachers are eligible to apply for the vaccine. My post today was to show my confidence in the system, in our government, and I hope everyone can at least feel more at ease knowing I went through the process,"" she told The Daily Beast.

On Monday, however, Griffith backpedaled and posted a public apology on her Instagram page.

""I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for my recent action in receiving the vaccine,"" Griffith wrote. ""I made a terrible error in judgment and for that I am truly sorry.""

The spin instructor did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment, and SoulCycle said Griffith operated in a ""personal capacity"" in applying for the vaccine.

2021-02-07 21:45:06+00:00,56,"JOHANNESBURG — South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its front-line health care workers with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested that it isn't effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in the country.

South Africa got its first 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last week and was expected to begin giving shots to health care workers in mid-February. The disappointing early results indicate that an inoculation drive using the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful.

Preliminary data from a small study suggested that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers only ""minimal protection against mild-moderate disease"" caused by the variant in South Africa. The variant appears to be more infectious, and it is driving a deadly resurgence of the disease in the country, accounting for more than 90 percent of the Covid-19 cases, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said Sunday night.

""The AstraZeneca vaccine appeared effective against the original strain but not against the variant,"" Mkhize said. ""We have decided to put a temporary hold on the rollout of the vaccine. ... More work needs to be done.""

The study, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, involved 2,000 people, most of whom were young and healthy. The volunteers' average age was 31.

""Protection against moderate-severe disease, hospitalization or death could not be assessed in this study as the target population were at such low risk,"" said a statement issued by Oxford University and the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

Scientists will study whether the AstraZeneca vaccine works against the variant to prevent death and severe disease, Mkhize said. Other vaccines have been less effective against the variant, but they have provided good protection against death and serious disease.

Public health officials are concerned about the South African variant because it includes a mutation of the coronavirus's characteristic spike protein, which is targeted by existing vaccines. South African officials say the variant is more contagious, and evidence is emerging that it may be more virulent.

South Africa will urgently roll out other vaccines to inoculate as many people as possible in the coming months, Mkhize said. Other South African scientists said Sunday that clinical trials for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine show good results against the variant.

The early results for the AstraZeneca vaccine against the variant could have far-reaching implications, as many other countries in Africa and beyond have been planning to use the AstraZeneca shot. The international COVAX initiative has bought the AstraZeneca vaccine in bulk from the Serum Institute of India.

Developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine expect to have a modified shot to cope with the South African coronavirus variant by autumn, the vaccine's lead researcher, Sarah Gilbert, told the BBC on Sunday.

Authorities in England last week went house to house to test for Covid-19 in eight areas where the South African variant is believed to be spreading after a handful of cases were found in people who had had no contact with the country or anyone who had traveled there.

More than 100 cases of the South African variant have been found in the U.K. The testing blitz is a bid to snuff out the variant before it spreads widely and undermines the U.K.'s vaccination rollout.

Britain has had Europe's deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 112,000 confirmed deaths, and it has embarked on a speedier vaccination plan than the neighboring European Union. So far, the U.K. has given first vaccine shots to about 11.5 million people.",MSNBC,"['variant', 'astrazeneca', 'questions', 'health', 'effectiveness', 'study', 'african', 'vaccines', 'south', 'halts', 'vaccine', 'africa', 'mkhize']",0

In 1994, Klibaner graduated from Princeton University, where he majored in applied mathematics and in which he kept a lifelong school pride.

After graduation, Klibaner began a career in finance before finding a niche consulting for dotcoms. A year after they were married, the couple moved to Shanghai. Klibaner, who could start up a conversation with anybody on almost any topic, had made a good enough first impression with a guest at a friend's wedding to get a job offer at the reception.

Two years later, he was hired by the Asia Pacific office of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., a real estate company, where he rose to be the head of research for Greater China.

""He was a natural coach and mentor to the staff, which is a strong quality, particularly in China, where at the time we had a very young local workforce who were eager to learn,"" said Klibaner's boss for five years, Anthony Couse, the CEO of the company's Asia Pacific office.

One of Klibaner's favorite interview questions for the young workforce: How many cows are there in all of China? He didn't care about the answer; it was all about the reasoning.

""Michael was also not shy of the media,"" Couse said. ""I could always count on him to take on the tough TV interviews at 5 a.m.""

Klibaner's lifelong love of talking kept him in demand as an expert on Asian real estate on Western outlets like Bloomberg and CNBC.

Sidney was born in 2011, and the family moved to Hong Kong two years later.

In Asia, the family had the opportunity to indulge in Klibaner's biggest passion — traveling all across the continent and beyond. Instead of a tent in a national park, however, he opted for a wine house in Capetown, South Africa.

Klibaner kept other hobbies. He may have outgrown baseball cards, but he stayed very much a collector. He kept elaborate databases that required a degree in advanced mathematics to decipher — whether they cataloged fancy bourbon, contemporary Chinese art or even the movies he watched.

He also loved to debate politics, and he found a lot about President Donald Trump to argue about. ""He knew something about everything in the world,"" his mother said. ""And if you read his Facebook postings, you know had an opinion on every single thing.""

By the summer of 2019, Klibaner was between jobs when he attended his 25th-year college reunion. Being so close to their families made Klibaner and his wife consider moving back. They did so that August.

While they were here, Klibaner looked forward to passing on his own love of learning to his daughter.

""When we moved back to New York, we got family memberships to the zoos, the museums and stuff like that,"" Amy said. ""And so we were really looking forward to taking advantage of all the cultural institutions here.""

They didn't get much of a chance before Michael got sick.

Then everything changed.

These days, his sister, Alyssa Geibel, comforts herself watching YouTube clips of the media interviews Klibaner did in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

""Just to see him alive and well and doing his job brings tears of happiness,"" Geibel said. ""I'm like, 'Oh, that's my brother.'""

There's no mathematical formula for how to handle the grief — even almost 10 months later.

""I often find myself bogged down with focusing on the loss,"" Amy said, ""and forget to remember the quirks that made Mike who he was.""",MSNBC,"['later', 'finds', 'klibaners', 'michael', 'loss', 'unexpected', 'know', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'science', 'school', 'theres', 'grieving', 'wife', 'amy', 'klibaner', 'family']",0
2021-02-07 18:45:04+00:00,109,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., decried the push to lower the income threshold to be eligible for stimulus checks in the latest Covid-19 relief package Sunday, calling it ""absurd"" and senseless.

""Well, I think what we have done in the past and what we have promised the American people, we have said two things in the last month,"" Sanders, chairman of the Budget Committee, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We said we're going to get you $2,000. And that's $600 plus $1,400. And what we're going to do is say that everybody, a single person, individual $75,000 or lower, and a couple of $150,000 or lower, will be eligible for that full $2,000, $600 plus $1,400.

""Now, when people said, 'We don't want rich people to get that benefit,' I understand that. I agree,"" Sanders continued. ""But to say to a worker in Vermont or California or any place else that, if you're making $52,000 a year, you are too rich to get this help, the full benefit, I think that that's absurd.""

Senate Democrats are split over who should be eligible for a new round of checks as they seek to pass a new stimulus package. The last round of checks was cut off for people making more than $99,000 or couples who made above $198,000. In his initial proposal, Biden recommended the same threshold.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., last week offered a nonbinding amendment backed by some other Democrats to ""ensure upper-income taxpayers are not eligible"" for the checks. Manchin wants to phase out the stimulus checks beginning at $50,000 per person or $100,000 per couple, rather than at $75,000 and $150,000.

Biden also opened the door to adjusting the income levels Wednesday in a call with Democrats.

Speaking on ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Biden thinks it's appropriate for those making more than $50,000 to get the full benefit. She didn't say whether sentiment extends up to $75,000.

""Well, President Biden is certainly willing to work with members of Congress to define what's fair,"" she said. ""And he wouldn't want to see a household making over $300,000 receive these payments. But if you think about an elementary school teacher or a policeman making $60,000 a year and faced with children who are out of school and people who may have had to withdraw from the labor force in order to take care of them and many extra burdens, I would — he thinks, and I would certainly agree — that it's appropriate for people there to get support.""

In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pressed for immediate action when asked whether it's worth it to lower the threshold if it means passing the bill sooner.

""Look, there's an active conversation going on right now, obviously, but the bottom line is we've got to support as many Americans as we can as robustly as we can and as quickly as we can,"" he said.

2021-02-07 18:31:08+00:00,87,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation's leading public health advisers, said Sunday that the U.S. should still proceed with its plan to give people both doses of the currently available Covid-19 vaccines, even as some top health care officials have suggested that the priority should be giving first doses to as many people as possible.

There’s disagreement among some experts about how to proceed amid supply shortages and new variants that could become more resistant to current vaccines or an increase in infections. Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who advised the President Joe Biden's transition team on the pandemic, said on last week’s “Meet the Press” that he believed prioritizing more first doses would set the country on a better path forward ahead of a possible new surge he compared to a “hurricane.”

But Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ""Meet the Press"" Sunday he doesn’t believe the science is clear yet on the issue, and that studying whether that path forward could be better would take too much time.

“What we have right now, and what we must go with, is the scientific data that we’ve accumulated. And it’s really solid,” Fauci said.

“You can do both, you can get as many people in their first dose at the same time as adhering, within reason, to the timetable of the second dose. It would be great to have the study, but I don’t think we could do it in time.”

There’s been a decline in daily coronavirus cases and new deaths, according to an NBC News analysis, in recent days, after a post-holiday peak. It’s been almost three weeks since the daily new caseload hit 200,000. But while new daily deaths have decreased on the whole, that decline has been slower than the decline in cases.

America’s vaccination rate has been steadily increasing since vaccines were first approved in December. While the pace is picking up, vaccine distribution and administration has suffered from its share of setbacks, and Fauci admitted there’s still far more demand than supply.

Fauci said that he expects the pace of vaccinations to continue to rise thanks to an increase in the supply for the vaccines currently available, as well as new vaccines like one from Johnson & Johnson, which is petitioning the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization.

“If you look at the escalation of the availability of doses purely on the ability and capability of manufacturing that, it’s going to escalate and will continue to escalate as we go from February to March to April and beyond. Even though there’s a clear, clear discrepancy between the demand and supply, that will get better,” he said.

While Fauci said some steps could have been taken earlier to lessen the issues, he admitted it was “a bit inevitable” either way.

“With all due respect and fairness, it’s a bit inevitable. We certainly, I guess, could have contracted a bit more aggressively with the companies to get more doses, but right now, this is what we have. These are the contractual arrangements, they're coming off the line as quickly as we can,” he said.

“Things will continue to get better.”",MSNBC,"['delaying', 'round', 'vaccinations', 'better', 'doses', 'supply', 'daily', 'clear', 'decline', 'vaccines', 'continue', 'cautions', 'fauci', 'bit', 'second', 'covid']",0
2021-02-07 17:15:07+00:00,75,"DETROIT — Kinda Makini-Anderson has been providing hot meals to households on Detroit's east side throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. By her count, Makini-Anderson's nonprofit Inner City Youth Group has provided over 150,000 meals in the last 10 months.

""We have always been there since 2009, assisting the community,"" she said on a recent snowy morning after delivering breakfast to a local family. ""But since the pandemic, it's been an overload.""

For the vast majority of the families she helps feed, however, these meals are not the only support they rely on to keep afloat. Makini-Anderson estimates that 98 percent of the households she serves are already getting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits — the government assistance program formerly known as food stamps. But the benefits provided by the nation's most important program for the hungry are simply not enough.

Experts and advocates say the pandemic has exposed a system that is outdated and inadequate.

Joseph Llobrera, director of research for the food assistance team at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank in Washington, said research shows SNAP isn't doing job No. 1: feeding the hungry. ""People run out of benefits two to three weeks into the month,"" he said.

Food relief organizations — from small church pantries and major regional food banks to organizations like Makini-Anderson's — have been shouldering a two-fold burden since the pandemic began: supporting the millions of Americans newly facing food insecurity, who don't participate in or don't qualify for SNAP, while also serving those already receiving assistance that doesn't get them through the month.

Before the pandemic, the average SNAP benefit was about $1.40 per person, per meal. During the pandemic, everyone on SNAP was bumped up to the maximum benefit of $2 per meal, but the families already at the maximum, those most in need, weren't given any additional funds.

Last month, the Biden administration challenged the Agriculture Department, which manages SNAP, to fix that but also to take an earlier-than-planned look at the basis for the benefit itself. Maximum benefit levels for SNAP are dictated by something called the ""Thrifty Food Plan,"" which is supposed to reflect the minimum cost of a nutritious diet.

But the Thrifty Food Plan hasn't been revised since 2006 and hasn't been dramatically reassessed since the 1970s, only increasing in line with inflation throughout the years. The plan wasn't due for reassessment for another two years.

""The Thrifty Food Plan is based on the assumption that people have a lot of time to price-shop and prepare meals from scratch, but the reality is that many families are juggling different jobs,"" Llobrera said. ""Building a food plan that assumes you're going to soak beans overnight rather than using canned beans — how realistic is that?"" Llobrera said the plan is also based on an outdated assumption that people spend the majority of their income on food, when in reality, most people now spend the biggest chunk of their paychecks on housing.

In the meantime, food banks have filled the gap.

""We've been at this for, what, 10, 11 months? And unfortunately, we have not seen a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Brian Barks, president and CEO of Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

When the pandemic began, NBC News reported that Barks' food bank had been so inundated by requests for assistance in applying for SNAP benefits that it had a backlog. Eventually, the food bank had to take down its advertisements about its SNAP assistance program because it was simply getting too many calls to handle.

""We would get such a huge call volume that with our limited staff, we just had no ability to keep up,"" Barks explained.

But the amount of food they had to purchase to keep up with the need went up, and up, and up. It went from $80,000 per month before the pandemic to a staggering $1.5 million that the food bank now spends each month to feed the pantries — and the people — that rely on them.

""There are some serious questions that Americans are asking themselves every day. 'Do I get the medicine that I need or do I buy food? Do I pay the electric bill or do I buy food?' The people who are in that gap that don't qualify for SNAP benefits, and those who do and still need food assistance, that's a big gap,"" he said.

Barks' food bank is not unique in this regard. Across the country at Feeding San Diego, which serves San Diego County and surrounding areas, 700,000 more meals are being distributed every month compared to the same time last year.

Barks said the changes to SNAP announced by the Biden administration last month have him feeling hopeful.

""SNAP is a political football. It always has been,"" he said, ""But it is a key, essential tool that every food bank needs in order to do the work that we do. We need help from the federal government, the state and local governments, to do this work. People who are waiting for food banks to solve the food insecurity problem in our country, we're not going to do it.""

In fact, the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks, of which both Food Bank for the Heartland and Feeding San Diego are members, conducted a study showing that for every meal provided by one of their food banks, SNAP can provide nine.

That's concerning for people like Makini-Anderson in Detroit, who often see struggling families that don't qualify for the boost that SNAP benefits provide.

Families like Barry Chambliss and Melissa Michaux's: With five kids under age 10 and dramatic losses to their income during the pandemic, Chambliss and Michaux have been scraping by. But when they applied for SNAP in the spring, they were denied.

""On the last denial that I've gotten, it said that I need to turn in verifications of end of employment for jobs that Barry hasn't had in years,"" Michaux said.

Efforts to challenge that decision and get in touch with a case worker led to unanswered phone calls and frustration, the couple said.

""People used to be able to go inside the office and actually complete the actual application, and they can have assistance with that,"" Makini-Anderson noted. Now ""it's hard for them to even navigate through their phone to complete this application.""

It's something Stacy Dean, the new deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the Agriculture Department, is acutely aware of.

""This is what in my new job is keeping me up at night, is who are we missing?"" Dean said. ""The process of applying for SNAP benefits is tough. It's incredibly rigorous. And trying to carry that out in a remote environment has made it, I think, a little bit more difficult both for the states who are running the program and the people who need the benefits.""

The cost of administering SNAP is split between states and the federal government, but as 6 million more people in America were added to the SNAP rolls last year, many states were essentially being asked to do more with the same or fewer resources and to do it all remotely.

""One of the things we want to do is ease up on some of the rules to make it easier for states to run the program,"" Dean said.

She acknowledged that food banks have stepped up. ""They can meet an emergency need very quickly,"" Dean said. ""Unfortunately, in this environment, they have been asked to do so much more, which is to provide food for longer periods of time and to supplement the federal food programs.""

For those who help meet the need, that's foreboding. After the Great Recession in 2008, it took a decade for food insecurity to fall back to previous levels.

""It is taking every ounce of energy that we have in order to try to help those people who have been added to the rolls of those who are now food insecure,"" Barks said. ""Anything, anything that can be done to alleviate the pressure that food banks are facing, to purchase and distribute food will benefit the hunger relief organizations in a positive way.""

Back in Detroit, things are looking up for Chambliss and Michaux. When reached for comment, a spokesperson from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said the agency couldn't comment on the particulars of Chambliss and Michaux's case due to confidentiality requirements. But since a ""Nightly News"" story aired this month focusing on the couple and their children, Makini-Anderson said the agency has reached out to the family offering to provide help.

2021-02-07 16:45:06+00:00,72,"Kaitlyn Romoser first caught Covid-19 in March, likely on a trip to Denmark and Sweden, just as the scope of the pandemic was becoming clear. Romoser, who is 23 and a laboratory researcher in College Station, Texas, tested positive and had a few days of mild, coldlike symptoms.

In the weeks that followed, she bounced back to what felt like a full recovery. She even got another test, which was negative, in order to join a study as one of the earliest donors of convalescent blood plasma in a bid to help others.

Six months later, in September, Romoser got sick again, after a trip to Florida with her dad. This second bout was much worse. She lost her sense of taste and smell and suffered lingering headaches and fatigue. She tested positive for Covid-19 once more — along with her cat.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Romoser believes it was a clear case of reinfection, rather than some mysterious reemergence of the original infection gone dormant. Because the coronavirus, like other viruses, regularly mutates as it multiplies and spreads through a community, a new infection would bear a different genetic fingerprint. But because neither lab had saved her testing samples for genetic sequencing, there was no way to confirm her suspicion.

“It would be nice to have proof,” said Romoser. “I’ve literally been straight up called a liar, because people don’t want to believe that it’s possible to be reinfected. Why would I lie about being sick?”

As millions of Americans struggle to recover from Covid-19 and millions more scramble for the protection offered by vaccines, U.S. health officials may be overlooking an unsettling subgroup of survivors: those who get infected more than once. Identifying how common reinfection is among people who contracted Covid-19 — as well as how quickly they become vulnerable and why — carries important implications for our understanding of immunity and the nation’s efforts to devise an effective vaccination program.

Scientists have confirmed that reinfections after initial illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus are possible, but so far have characterized them as rare. Fewer than 50 cases have been substantiated worldwide, according to a global reinfection tracker. Just five have been substantiated in the U.S., including two detected in California in late January.

That sounds like a rather insignificant number. But scientists’ understanding of reinfection has been constrained by the limited number of U.S. labs that retain Covid-19 testing samples or perform genetic sequencing. A KHN review of surveillance efforts finds that many U.S. states aren’t rigorously tracking or investigating suspected cases of reinfection.

I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection.

KHN sent queries about reinfection surveillance to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of 24 responses, fewer than half provided details about suspected or confirmed reinfection cases. Where officials said they’re actively monitoring for reinfection, they have found far more potential cases than previously anticipated.

In Washington state, for instance, health officials are investigating nearly 700 cases that meet the criteria for possible reinfection, with three dozen awaiting genetic sequencing and just one case confirmed.

In Colorado, officials estimate that possible reinfections make up just 0.1 percent of positive coronavirus cases. But with more than 396,000 cases reported, that means nearly 400 people may have been infected more than once.

In Minnesota, officials have investigated more than 150 cases of suspected reinfection, but they lack the genetic material to confirm a diagnosis, a spokesperson said.

In Nevada, where the first U.S. case of Covid-19 reinfection was identified last summer, Mark Pandori, director of the state public health lab, said there’s no doubt cases are going undetected.

“I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection,” he said. “They are very difficult to ascertain, so you need specialized teams to do that work, or a core lab.”

Such cases are different from instances of so-called long-haul Covid-19, in which the original infection triggers debilitating symptoms that linger for months and viral particles can continue to be detected. Reinfection occurs when a person is infected with Covid-19, clears that strain and is infected again with a different strain, raising concerns about sustained immunity from the disease. Such reinfections occur regularly with four other coronaviruses that circulate among humans, causing common colds.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines call for investigating for possible reinfection when someone tests positive for Covid-19 at least 90 days after an original infection (or at least 45 days for “highly suspicious” cases). Confirmation of reinfection requires genetic sequencing of paired samples from each episode to tell whether the genomes involved are different.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

But the U.S. lacks the capacity for robust genetic sequencing, the process that identifies the fingerprint of a specific virus so it can be compared with other strains. Jeff Zients, head of the federal Covid task force, noted late last month that the U.S. ranks 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing.

To date, only a fraction of positive coronavirus samples has been sequenced, though the Biden administration is working to rapidly expand the effort. On Feb. 1, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters that sequencing has “increased tenfold” in recent weeks, from 251 sequences the week of Jan. 10 to 2,238 the week of Jan. 24. The agency is working with private companies, states and academic labs to ramp up to 6,000 sequences per week by mid-February.

Washington’s state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, Dr. Scott Lindquist, said officials have prioritized genetic sequencing at the state laboratory, with plans to begin genotyping 5 percent of all samples collected. That will allow officials to sort through those nearly 700 potential reinfections, Lindquist said. More important, the effort will also help signal the presence of significantly mutated forms of the coronavirus, known as variants, that could affect how easily the virus spreads and, perhaps, how sick Covid-19 makes people.

“Those two areas, reinfection and variants, may cross paths,” he said. “We wanted to be in front of it, not behind it.”

How long does immunity last?

The specter of reinfections complicates one of the central questions of the Covid-19 threat: How long after natural infection or vaccination will people remain immune?

Early studies suggested immunity would be short-lived, only a few months, while more recent research finds that certain antibodies and memory cells may persist in Covid-infected patients longer than eight months.

“We actually don’t know” the marker that would signal immunity, said Dr. Jason Goldman, an infectious diseases expert at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. “We don’t have the test you could perform to say yes or no, you could be infected.”

Goldman and colleagues confirmed a case of reinfection in a Seattle man last fall, and since then have identified six or seven probable cases. “This is a much more common scenario than is being recognized,” he said.

The possibility of reinfection means that even patients who’ve had Covid-19 need to remain vigilant about curbing re-exposure, said Dr. Edgar Sanchez, an infectious diseases physician at Orlando Health in Florida.

“A lot of patients ask, ‘How long do I have to worry about getting Covid again?’” he said. “I literally tell them this: ‘You are probably safe for a few weeks, maybe even up to a couple of months, but beyond that, it’s really unclear.’”

The message is similar for the wider society, said Dr. Bill Messer, an expert in viral genetics at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, who has been pondering the cultural psychology of the Covid-19 response. Evidence suggests there may not be a clear-cut return to normal.

“The idea that we will end this pandemic by beating this coronavirus, I don’t think that’s actually the way it’s going to happen,” he said. “I think that it’s more likely that we’re going to learn how to be comfortable living with this new virus circulating among us.”",MSNBC,"['tracking', 'reinfection', 'possible', 'isnt', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'common', 'cases', 'officials', 'samples', 'realized', 'genetic', 'reinfections', 'covid', 'sequencing']",0
2021-02-07 16:15:05+00:00,43,"LOS ANGELES — Yaneth Gutierrez, 34, an agricultural worker who picks produce in California's Central Valley, had to take two days off when she fell ill. Two weeks after she tested positive for Covid-19, the mother of two lost her job picking carrots because she did not show up to work.

“I don’t have the luxury of getting sick,” Gutierrez said. “I have not been vaccinated. I have to take extra care so I don't get sick again. I have heard bad rumors about the vaccine and I am scared, but the risk of bringing the virus home is bigger.”

California recently announced a shift in vaccine eligibility, from labor-sector-based to an age-based system that prioritizes Californians over 65. However, the state plans to continue vaccinating school personnel, emergency services and health care workers as well as food and agriculture workers as it transitions into the new age-based system, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said last week.

In an interview with NBC News, California Surgeon General Nadine Burke Harris said equity was at the forefront and that those who were already deemed eligible would have access to the vaccine, including farmworkers.

But trying to get vaccines for essential workers who qualify is proving to be difficult, according to some groups. United Farm Workers, the large labor organization, said it has not been able to get vaccine appointments for its workers through the state’s online portal.

Staff members said they have not been able to get past the first page of the portal. The pop-up message they get reads, “Based on your results you are not eligible for the current phase of the rollout but you will be eligible for a future phase.”

I spoke to #Latino #EssentialWorkers adversely impacted by CA’s shift in vaccination tier sys. from work-based to age. I was told by state rep that all in original Tier 1B under 65 could still access. I went to “My turn” portal as if I was a farmworker. No luck securing a slot.💉 pic.twitter.com/5HshHSKkbj — Cora Cervantes (@cora_cervantes) February 5, 2021

""I feel discriminated against,"" Gutierrez said. ""I think they should give those of us in the fields priority. I think we all deserve the vaccine.""

Teresa Romero, president of United Farm Workers, said many workers who are vulnerable are not being vaccinated.

""In the past two weeks, we have had three farmworkers under 65 pass away from Covid-19. The vaccine age limit is impacting the majority of people of color who are a part of the labor force,"" Romero said. ""Conservatively, I can say that 90 percent of farmworkers in California are Latino.""

Latino officials and labor advocates are echoing these concerns about the shift in tiers, saying these changes are putting Latino essential workers and their families at risk when counties throughout California are lifting restrictions.

Ron Herrera, president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, blasted Newsom's decision, calling it ""devastating.""

“The governor's decision to shift from labor to age I think will prolong the infection rate because workers aren’t protected,"" Herrera said. ""On day one, this federation preached that if we wanted to get control of the virus in Los Angeles, we had to control the workplace. If the workplace isn't contained, workers are taking the virus to their homes and communities. In the case of Latinos, these tend to be multigenerational homes.”

According to the U.S. Census, Latinos make up 39 percent of California’s population, but make up 55 percent of all confirmed Covid-19 cases and 46.5 percent of all deaths, according to state data.

The median age of a Latino in California is 28; only 7 percent of Latinos in the state are older than 64. The age required to make a vaccination appointment for non-health workers is 65.

In the state, Latinos make up half of front-line workers. But some front-line workers in service, production, transportation and material moving are not currently eligible for the vaccine.

“Latino families are overwhelmed by this pandemic, and the current safety net does not include all Californians,” said state Sen. María Elena Durazo, chair of the Latino Legislative Caucus, in a statement relating to health disparities and workplace inequities Latinos face amid the pandemic.

This week, Newsom announced the opening of two vaccination centers, one at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland and another at the California State University campus in East Los Angeles, two areas that have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus.

Los Angeles native María Patiño, 30, said nearly every member of her immediate family was infected with Covid-19, including both of her parents. Her family consists of essential workers who reside in a multigenerational household. Last month, her mother, Rosa María Patiño, died of the coronavirus. She was 63 and a food-factory worker.

""She would arrive at work early to be sanitized, but there are three different shifts with a lot of workers working closely to inspect the food,"" Patiño said. ""She wanted to be vaccinated. She was planning to retire in March.""

2021-02-07 07:05:33+00:00,98,"Nobody said that getting President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 stimulus package through Congress would be easy. But Republicans really have chosen to make it as hard as possible, and for the flimsiest of reasons.

Democrats should absolutely do what it takes to win over GOP support and reduce the debt this package would incur.

We hear two main categories of complaint from GOP senators. First, that the bill is too large, too soon and, most important, that the U.S. can’t be adding this much to the deficit even though the country has been dealing with a pandemic for almost a full year. Second, they object to Democrats setting themselves up to pass the package without Republican votes if necessary.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell even promised on Wednesday to force Democrats to vote on things even the GOP doesn’t want to pass, as punishment for moving so quickly and without Republicans’ input on how to help fewer Americans.

Look, folks, the fact is the $1.9 trillion package Biden laid out might get whittled down some during the bipartisan negotiations underway. But I’m willing to bet that anything that costs much more than the minimalist proposal a group of Republican senators produced won’t gain many — if any — GOP votes in the process.

I’ve been through why Republicans suddenly thinking deficits are bad again was both long-coming and completely ridiculous. But let’s take them at their word for a minute.

In that case, Democrats should absolutely do what it takes to win over GOP support and reduce the debt this package would incur. The easiest solution: put the Trump tax cuts on the table.

All together Biden’s proposed changes are poised to raise federal coffers by at least $3.1 trillion over the next decade.

It makes perfect sense. In 2017, the GOP-controlled Congress used budget reconciliation to pass the changes to the tax code that ended up costing up to $2 trillion in lost revenue for the United States over the next decade. That in turn prompted the federal debt to balloon by $3.9 trillion during former President Donald Trump’s term. (We’ll leave aside the massive hole blown into the budget last year thanks to the pandemic.)

So, if we’re to take Republican demands that the deficit be kept down seriously, it’s only fair to look at new revenue, which was not included in the original package.

Now, Biden has said that he doesn’t want to roll back all of the Trump tax cuts — just those on the wealthy and corporations, which feels fair in the middle of a pandemic. You don’t necessarily want to raise taxes on the people whose wages have failed to keep up with inflation. According to a New York Times analysis, doing so would net about $500 billion over the next 10 years.

If that’s not enough to offset the deficit in Republican eyes, well, good thing there’s the rest of Biden’s tax plan to add in. All together Biden’s proposed changes are poised to raise federal coffers by at least $3.1 trillion over the next decade, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates. May as well get that in the stimulus package, too, if this is what Republicans really want to argue.

OK, so that’s more than the cost of the full package and then some covered with new revenue increases. Will that win over moderates in support of Biden’s complete proposal? Not likely. As part of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s confirmation, Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Rob Portman of Ohio — both GOP members of the moderate bipartisan negotiating group I mentioned earlier — peppered her with written questions expressing concerns about repealing the Trump cuts. The rest of the caucus doesn’t seem too thrilled either.

Why wait for another fight when it’s clear that this one has already escalated?

But repeal would do a few things that will be helpful in the long run: First, it would actually begin adding the revenue that Biden will need for the rest of his agenda. Yellen, during her confirmation hearing, pledged that the president would wait to repeal the Trump cuts specifically, which The New York Times speculated meant it would be part of Biden’s pending infrastructure proposal. But why wait for another fight when it’s clear that this one has already escalated?

Second, it nullifies two key GOP arguments: that stimulus spending is an unpaid-for addition to the national debt and that reconciliation is the wrong way to pass this kind of legislation. The Trump tax cuts came into this world with just 51 votes and over Democratic objections. It seems fitting that they’d leave it the same way — with the important distinction that the people who supporters say would benefit from the bill would actually benefit this time around.

And third, it would serve as a reminder to the GOP opposition that what they are experiencing is Democratic courtesy. If the only negotiations that need to take place are within the ruling party, then there are a lot of things that could muster the votes to pass via reconciliation in this initial package.

Congress is getting ready to settle into the hard work of actually writing this bill in both houses of Congress. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer should make it clear that this is serious. And if Republicans would, say, vote for a stimulus bill without revenue increases after all, more power to them.",MSNBC,"['tax', 'package', 'trillion', 'help', 'plan', 'bidens', 'trump', 'pass', 'cuts', 'pay', 'republicans', 'stimulus', 'revenue', 'repealing', 'covid', 'gop']",0

2021-02-06 22:45:08+00:00,17,"A calendar coincidence means the human loss from the coronavirus will not be reflected in the 2020 census, and that could save a congressional seat for New York but cost Alabama one.

Because the start of the pandemic in the U.S. and the April 1 reference date used for the census fell so close to each other last year, the deaths that began in mid-March will not show up in the state population figures that determine political representation in Congress.

The timing will paper over the losses from the virus, which has killed over 44,000 people in New York state, including concentrations in some New York City neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Alabama has reported around 8,000 virus-related deaths.

New York still is projected to lose at least one seat, but the quirk in the calendar should ensure that the state gets the last of the 435 congressional seats by a margin of more than 20,000 people, and that would save it from losing a second congressional seat, said Kimball Brace, a redistricting expert at Election Data Services.

“When you get to that last seat or two, any little change could have an impact,” Brace said.

The once-a-decade headcount of every U.S. resident determines the number of congressional seats, and Electoral College votes, each state gets. Redistricting experts estimate that 10 congressional seats will shift among 17 states when the Census Bureau releases apportionment numbers by April 30.

The division of congressional seats is sometimes decided by relatively small numbers — just thousands or even hundreds of people.

Brace drew the conclusions using population estimates released in December. Getting that last available spot during the apportionment process would keep New York from losing its 26th congressional seat, but it would cost Alabama its seventh seat in the House.

The April 1 reference means people were required to use that date in answering census questions. If the reference date had been July 1, Alabama would keep its seventh seat by a more than 6,200-person margin. But that would cost New York a second seat, reducing its number of representatives in the House from 27 to 25, according to Brace's analysis. By the start of July last year, New York had experienced more than 32,000 virus-related deaths.

Brace cautions that those scenarios are tempered by the accuracy of the December estimates and the 2020 census, which took place amid the pandemic and natural disasters. The count was also dogged by concerns that the participation of immigrants and Latinos could be suppressed by the Trump administration's failed efforts to exclude people who are in the country illegally from the process of allocating congressional seats.

Both Brace and William Frey of the Brookings Institution predict that Texas will gain three seats, Florida two seats, and an extra seat each will go to Arizona, Colorado, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon.

On the flip side, Alabama, California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia each stand to lose a congressional seat, according to Frey and Brace, though Brace estimates that New York could lose up to two seats.

The loss would be a first for California, the nation's most populous state.

Other states have close margins for either gaining or losing a seat. Montana's seat gain would be by less than 5,000 people, and Rhode Island is expected to lose a congressional seat by less than 17,000 people, according to Brace.

Even though the numbers will not be released for months, Alabama has been fighting to save its seventh congressional seat through a lawsuit filed more than two years ago. The case seeks to exclude people who are in the country illegally from the apportionment process, even though the Constitution spells out that every person in each state should be counted. President Donald Trump issued a similar directive last year, but President Joe Biden rescinded it upon taking office.

Including people in the U.S. illegally “will place Alabama at substantial risk of losing political representation,"" the state of Alabama said Thursday in a court filing.

Alabama officials are optimistic their push to get residents to participate in the census made a difference, said Mike Presley, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs.

“When the Census Bureau releases the data from the 2020 count, we are hopeful that the state’s strong effort, which resulted in a higher self-response rate than in 2010, will lead to positive news for Alabama,"" Presley said.

In New York, where more than 40% of residents live in New York City, the virus made it more difficult to reach hard-to-count minority communities. Advocacy groups were prevented from going door to door to convince people to answer questionnaires, and many residents of wealthy neighborhoods fled the city during the census, said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York.

Plus, New York City has been undercounted in past censuses, countering any advantage New York may have had because of the April 1 reference date, said Melva Miller, CEO of the Association for a Better New York.

“We know New York City is a terribly hard place to count, and numerous people are historically undercounted,” Miller said. “In terms of whether we did better because we might have had some people counted, I can’t see that is the case.”",MSNBC,"['wont', 'seen', 'york', 'virus', 'timing', 'deaths', 'brace', 'calendar', 'alabama', 'city', 'congressional', 'state', 'reference', 'seat', 'seats', 'census', 'means']",0
2021-02-06 19:32:07+00:00,27,"TEL AVIV — As Israel outpaces Western nations in its Covid-19 vaccination effort, it has become a role model for a world aching to return to life as it once was.

The country has inoculated a third of its population of 9 million in little more than a month, and over 80 percent of those 60 and older.

But if you ask most Israelis, the country's handling of the coronavirus has been anything but a success story. A recent poll by the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute found that just 24 percent of Israelis approve of the government's management of the crisis.

While Israel boasts the world's highest vaccination rate, it is also battling the world’s third-worst infection rate.

Despite the vaccination campaign, January was Israel's deadliest month, with 1,433 people dying from the virus — a third of the 5,000 fatalities since the pandemic began. Israelis have also experienced some of the world’s strictest and longest national lockdowns, with residents mostly confined to their homes for a cumulative four months.

In late December, Israel became the first country to enter a third lockdown. Meant to last two weeks, it is still in force.

Much of Israel's successful vaccination rollout rests on its small size — roughly equivalent to New Jersey in both land size and population — and its centralized universal health care system that enables virtually all Israelis to be vaccinated quite seamlessly.

Yet there is another element driving Israel's sprint toward becoming the first country to vaccinate a majority of its population: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is running for re-election, again.

“Many Israelis feel that the management of this crisis has been very much affected by Netanyahu’s own political considerations,” Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said.

In previous elections, Netanyahu was fighting corruption charges; now, ahead of the March 23 election, he faces trial on those charges, a challenger from his own party, and a pandemic that has killed thousands of Israelis and left many feeling that he has failed to safely navigate this crisis.

Netanyahu, whose trial has been delayed several times due to the lockdowns and is scheduled to appear in court Monday, seems to be counting on a successful vaccination operation to not only enable Israel to emerge from the coronavirus, but also to help win him re-election.

“He thinks the vaccine is going to help him, but I don’t, because the situation in Israel is only getting worse,” said Orly Almog, a member of the Black Flag movement, an anti-Netanyahu protest that began in March 2020 and has been demonstrating against Netanyahu since the pandemic began.

Experts say the vaccine has not been as effective in lowering the caseload as some expected because not enough Israelis have been fully inoculated—35 percent have received the first dose, while 20 percent have received both.

Also, according to Itamar Grotto, associate director general at the Ministry of Health, the vast majority of new cases in Israel are associated with the British variant, which is potentially more contagious and difficult to control with the current vaccines.

Political opponents and anti-Netanyahu protesters aren't the only ones criticizing his handling of the pandemic.

Some 200 leading Israeli doctors and scientists have established two groups — the Common Sense Model and the Public Emergency Council for the Coronavirus Crisis (PECC) — to speak out against what they say is the mismanagement of the crisis. Members of these groups include former directors of Israel’s Ministry of Health, heads of Israeli hospitals and medical schools, and recipients of the Nobel Prize and the Israel Prize, the country’s highest distinction.

According to these experts, Israel’s reliance on national closures has been both unnecessary and ineffective.

""Lockdowns can lower the prevalence of disease, but in the end, they do not affect the number of sick or dead people,” said Dr. Yoav Yehezkelli, member of the Common Sense Model and the PECC who helped design Israel’s programs for dealing with an epidemic.

Lockdowns, he said, “can be taken in an extreme situation where the health system is flooded as we saw in the beginning of the pandemic in China or Italy.”

But the Israeli health care system “has never been close to collapsing” said Yehezkelli, who lectures on emergency and disaster management at Tel Aviv University.

Not all medical experts share this perspective.

Lockdowns “have been very very useful in reducing morbidity and mortality in the first two rounds,” said Ronit Calderon-Margalit, a professor of epidemiology at Hebrew University, who has been advising the government, referring to Israel’s previous lockdowns.

It’s the steps taken getting out of lockdowns that can cause problems.

“There hasn’t been a clear strategy of the government, and even when there was, in the case of the traffic light strategy, it was never carried out,” Calderon-Margalit added, referring to the model in which lockdowns are enforced in “red” areas with high infection rates, and “green” areas with low infection rates have more freedom.

“We wasted the arsenal of the lockdowns,” she added.

Even government officials say the latest lockdown has been a failure.

“The forecasts were wrong,” Ran Balicer, the chairman of the national expert panel on Covid-19 said minutes before a Cabinet meeting Thursday.

“Lockdown as a means of magic … is dead,” added Balicer, a professor in the Department of Public Health at Ben-Gurion University.

Ahead of this meeting, Netanyahu was pushing for another lockdown extension. In the hours before the lockdown was supposed to end on Friday morning, the government announced that it would be extended until Sunday.

As in other countries, some experts also decry the overwhelming economic costs of closure.

According to Aaron Ciechan over, recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry, “four hours of lockdown is worth the annual budget of the Israel Cancer Association.”

Yehezkelli and his colleagues worry most about the devastating long-term effects on Israelis’ physical and mental health.

These medical experts also believe the government’s decisions have been driven by politics. Health Minister Yuli Edelstein is a Netanyahu political appointee with no background in health. His predecessor, Yakov Litzman, who served until May 2020, had no medical background, flouted his own ministry’s coronavirus guidelines, and tested positive for Covid-19.

Critics cite as a prime example of politically driven decision-making the lack of enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines in many ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, where schools often remain open, and huge weddings and funerals continue to take place.

Israel would be in a much better place, many medical experts say, had Netanyahu not abandoned the so-called traffic light strategy to enforce lockdowns.

Israel's previous coronavirus czar, Ronni Gamzu, tried to implement that strategy, but was blocked by Netanyahu because many of the red areas are ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods that are strongholds for the embattled prime minister. Not wanting to alienate the ultra-Orthodox, who represent 12 percent of Israel's population, Netanyahu opted for the current across-the-board approach.

The resentment created by this double standard will be a factor for many voters in March, Plesner said. “Enforcement is highly skewed in favor of the ultra-Orthodox population,” who according to government statistics constitute nearly 40 percent of virus cases, and receive just 2 percent of fines for violating lockdown rules.

According to Calderon and other medical experts who are not part of the Common Sense Model or the PECC, virtually every health professional in Israel agrees that the traffic light policy is preferable to the all-out lockdown, which has led to a fatigue that hinders compliance, making this lockdown less effective.

Grotto, the Health Ministry official, said there is truth to criticism that Netanyahu’s handling of the pandemic may be driven by political interests.

“But it’s also cultural. Even if the ultra-Orthodox community was not part of the [governing] coalition, still there would be a problem with the enforcement,” he said, noting that despite the high death toll among them, many religious leaders and their followers continue to rebel against restrictions.

The prime minister’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.

For most democratically elected leaders, these challenges could present an existential threat to any hope of re-election.

Yet Netanyahu is known as a political wizard, or “King Bibi” to his base, for good reason.

According to the latest polls, Netanyahu has the best chances of forming a government, though he is favored by just about 30 percent of voters.

2021-02-06 18:32:06+00:00,87,"WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress have begun to utilize an arcane process known as reconciliation to fast-track President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.

Most importantly, the measure allows them to circumvent the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which would otherwise require them to get Republican support. As the U.S. economy continues to reel from the crisis, Biden and many Democrats say Americans are less concerned about process and more so about delivering relief.

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

""Nobody in my state knows what the hell reconciliation is. They believe that Joe Biden said, ‘If we win Georgia, we’re getting $2,000 checks.’ And we won Georgia. So we have an obligation to follow through,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told NBC News.

Here are some questions and answers on how the process works.

What is reconciliation?

Senate rules require that most pieces of legislation get 60 votes, which under the current Senate would mean all of the Democrats and 10 Republicans.

But ""reconciliation"" is a process created under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that allows a simple majority to pass certain types of legislation. It was set up to allow lawmakers to change policy on spending or taxes to keep the nation's budget in line.

Isn't that abnormal?

Not really. It has been used by Congress during the last four presidential administrations, when the same party controlled the legislative branch and the White House.

Reconciliation was used during Donald Trump's and George W. Bush's presidencies to cut taxes. While Barack Obama was in office, Congress used it to pass parts of the Affordable Care Act. During Bill Clinton's administration, it was used it to raise taxes. There have also been bipartisan reconciliation bills passed under divided government.

So Democrats can pass a bill without Republicans?

Because the current Senate is split 50-50 and the vice president, who casts the tiebreaking vote, is a Democrat, then a bill created through reconciliation could pass without any Republican support.

Then why don't Senate leaders use it all the time?

There are limitations. The process is only permitted once per fiscal year, and it can only be used to change — or ""reconcile"" — laws related to taxes and spending.

So how does the process work?

The Senate and House both passed the budget resolution, instructing committees to craft the reconciliation legislation, which can evade the Senate filibuster.

What if the bill increases the deficit?

The reconciliation rules allow bills that raise the deficit, but only for 10 years. Laws that the Congressional Budget Office determines will raise the deficit outside the 10-year window are not eligible. This is why some items passed through reconciliation, like Trump's individual tax cuts, were made to be temporary.

Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., reads his opening statement during the markup of a bill on May 15, 2008. Scott J. Ferrell / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images

What is the Byrd rule?

It's a law named after former Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., that allows a provision to be removed from a reconciliation bill if a senator objects and it is deemed ""extraneous"" to the budget. It basically makes sure no unrelated provisions can be snuck into the bill. The Senate parliamentarian is tasked with deciding what is and isn't ""extraneous.""

What if it's not exactly a new tax or spending item but affects the budget?

There are some gray areas. If there's a dispute, the Senate parliamentarian would settle it. In theory, a majority of senators could overrule the parliamentarian, but that would be unusual.

Why do senators keep saying the phrase 'Byrd bath'?

That's an insider-y term for the process of cleansing the reconciliation bill of provisions that don't comply with the Byrd rule.

Can $1,400 checks and jobless benefits pass in this process?

Yes, policies like those are clearly budgetary and shouldn't have a problem passing through reconciliation. Those are core components of the Democratic virus relief effort.

What's an example of a policy that can't pass?

Regulatory measures, such as gun control or rewriting immigration rules, are likely to run afoul of the Byrd rule and therefore cannot pass under this process.

Can the minimum wage be raised in reconciliation?

There's some dispute about this. Many budget experts believe that would be regulatory and can't be passed under reconciliation. But some, like incoming Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., take a more expansive view of the process and say it can be used.",MSNBC,"['reconciliation', 'fasttrack', 'bill', 'used', 'relief', 'passed', 'process', 'byrd', 'senate', 'pass', 'taxes', 'budget', 'covid', 'explainer']",0

2021-02-06 06:02:01+00:00,31,"Nearly two months into the Covid-19 vaccination effort, U.S. public health authorities have another challenge on their hands: making sure that people who've had their first shots return for their second shots.

Initial data show that most people are going back for their second shots. Data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showed that just 0.3 percent of the 1.9 million people vaccinated thus far were late for their second shots — although 7.5 percent more are due.

In Oregon, 5 percent of people who received their first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are late for their second shots, according to the state's public health data.

Researchers have reasons for concern. Vaccines for other types of illnesses may give clues about the challenge for public health authorities. For the anti-shingles vaccine Shingrix, about 25 percent of people who get the first dose don't show up for their second doses, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

""You should be hounded that you are due for your second dose,"" he said.

It's not a given that everyone will be diligent about completing the vaccination process on schedule, despite the scientific evidence that a booster shot makes the coronavirus vaccines more than 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness.

""The vast majority of people due for their second doses have gotten them, but there some who haven't and are now past that six-week mark when it is recommended,"" Chris Van Deusen, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an email.

""We definitely want people to get their booster doses on time because they are important to boosting immunity,"" he said.

And as vaccinations roll out beyond front-line health care workers and older Americans, there is some concern that the number of people failing to get their second doses could grow. Offit said states, counties and health care providers will need to rely on a combination of newer technology, such as smartphone notifications, and older tactics, such as phone calls, to be sure to get people's attention.

""God only knows that retail pharmacies are good at this. The minute your prescription comes in, you get the message and you get it again and again and again,"" he said.

The push is taking place against the backdrop of a public debate around whether to delay the second shots and focus on getting the first shots to as many people as possible. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., sent a letter Feb. 3 urging Biden administration officials to consider shifting to a one-dose strategy, an idea that many experts, including Offit, say is ill-conceived, because that's not how the Covid-19 vaccines were tested. Immunization is weaker and may not last as long with one dose, Offit said.

The guidance from the Biden administration and states is to complete the two-dose regimen.

Second doses are due about three weeks after the first doses for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and around four weeks for the Moderna vaccine, according to guidance published last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC also said the boosters could be given up to six weeks later if it isn't feasible to get them sooner.

The first doses of the Pfizer vaccine were administered Dec. 14, meaning the recommended interval just recently ended for those patients' second shots.

There could be any number of reasons people haven't gotten their second shots, experts said, and there's no good evidence yet about the leading reasons. They could include limited supply, canceled appointments, fear of side effects, forgetfulness or difficulty navigating appointment scheduling.

Politics may also be a factor. Offit said he was concerned that some governors were quietly de-emphasizing the second doses. He said he had spoken with public health authorities who were feeling pressure to prioritize the first doses, at least in part because those numbers are often highlighted in the news media. He declined to identify the states.

""There is pressure to get as many people vaccinated as possible so that your state doesn't look as worse as other states,"" Offit said.

Not all states report data about how many people are overdue for their second doses, making it difficult for public health and medical experts to gauge how much catching up states and health care providers have to do.

Florida reported the number of overdue doses in January, indicating that tens of thousands of people were late at the time. But the label may not have been meaningful under eventual CDC guidance, because that was before six weeks had passed since the first doses Dec. 14. In any case, Florida eventually stopped reporting the number.

Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida, said it was difficult to know yet whether states are struggling or how concerned to be. He said he was encouraged that, in recent days, Florida has been administering more second doses than first doses.

""It would take a little bit deeper investigation to know whether we should be worried about this,"" he said. ""I'm hoping that they're at least collecting that information, analyzing it and following up.""

Florida's health department didn't respond to a request for comment.

Vaccine experts are concerned that people may not realize that one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna shots won't be enough to fully protect them against the virus. Offit specifically worries that getting only one dose of the mRNA vaccines or waiting for many months between doses might make it easier for the coronavirus to mutate.

""One dose might make it easier to create variants, because the virus is wounded with a lesser immune response, not killed,"" he said by email. ""And when wounded, it has a chance to escape.""",MSNBC,"['thousands', 'states', 'covid19', 'doses', 'health', 'public', 'offit', 'dose', 'weeks', 'vaccine', 'second', 'need', 'shots', 'pester']",0
2021-02-06 02:25:06+00:00,54,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, families aren't pursuing benefits they qualify for, fearing that a Trump administration rule will affect the chances of an immigrant family member to get a green card or U.S. citizenship.

A study by the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy think tank, found that about 1 in 7 adults in immigrant families, 13.6 percent, reported not having enrolled in programs like Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and housing subsidies last year — even though they or their relatives were eligible — because of worries that it would affect their legalization efforts.

Karin, 42, who asked to be identified by only her first name to avoid government attention, is one of them. Karin, who works as a housekeeper, has lived in Los Angeles for 15 years after having fled violence in Guatemala. She and her two older daughters are trying to find a way to get employment authorizations or green cards; her youngest daughter was born in the U.S.

She has been reluctant to sign up for Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, even though it's available to qualifying state residents regardless of legal status.

Under the Trump administration's rule changes, immigrants seeking legal status whose families enrolled in publicly funded programs could be considered ""public charges"" if officials determined that they might be likely to need public assistance.

The change occurred after the Trump administration expanded the definition of the term. The Department of Homeland Security had previously defined a ""public charge"" as someone who depended on cash assistance or government-funded long-term institutional care, but the Trump-era rule expanded the definition to include additional benefits, such as food stamps, nonemergency Medicaid, certain prescription drug subsidies and housing vouchers.

President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling for an ""immediate review of agency actions on public charge inadmissibility.""

Karin said she would rather remain uninsured until the Biden administration explicitly says that signing up for state public health insurance wouldn't classify people as ""public charges"" and wouldn't jeopardize her legalization efforts.

The Urban Institute found that almost 28 percent of immigrants in families with members who didn't have green cards avoided an array of public benefits they were eligible for because of the rule's ""chilling effect.""

Eliseo Lopez, 72, a handyman, has lived in Los Angeles for three decades. He has struggled to get enough work to make ends meet during the pandemic, and age-related ailments make it more difficult to continue working.

As a permanent resident, Lopez qualifies for retirement benefits. But he refused to apply last year out of fear that he could endanger his wife's chances of getting a green card.

""We stopped all of my wife's immigration paperwork because of Trump's anti-immigrant behavior. We always stayed on the sidelines, never asking anyone for help,"" Lopez said in Spanish. ""I just wouldn't do anything that could potentially get her deported.""

His daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, helped them financially after they ran out of savings during the pandemic. Because of the family's mixed immigration status, they didn't get any Covid-19 stimulus checks.

Lopez said that now that Biden is president, he is more comfortable resuming his wife's legalization process.

Hamutal Bernstein, the study's co-author, said, ""I think there's going to have to be a very strong information and education effort given the extended period of time and misinformation and fear and confusion around this rule.""

Bernstein found that other factors are also deterring families from applying for benefits, including fears over information-sharing across immigration enforcement authorities, language barriers and challenges navigating enrollment.

'There's always fear'

Karla, 39, an immigrant from Mexico who asked to be identified by only her first name to avoid government attention, lost her job in child care during the pandemic and has been cleaning houses to make ends meet.

Her husband is an essential worker who delivers produce to supermarkets. They have three children.

""We're living just to have enough money for rent and food,"" Karla said in Spanish. The only additional help she recalled having received to support her three teenage boys, all of whom are U.S. citizens, has been meals through the state's school lunch program. ""There's always fear, but sometimes the need wins and you apply to certain programs while afraid that it may affect your legal status in the future.""

Karla said she wishes she had health insurance after she underwent traumatic emergency dental surgery two years ago.

""I just need healthy teeth I can use to eat well,"" she said. ""I barely go to the doctor, because I don't have access to it. If something hurts a lot, I have no choice but to go to the emergency room.""

Karla said that she has looked into enrolling in California's public health insurance program but that the application process has been tough.

Bernstein said, ""To complement whatever the administration does to undo the rule, it will also be really important to do some very intentional education, communications, engagement with immigrant families to inform them about the policy changes—also to try to rebuild trust and reduce some of those fears of taking part in programs that they or their children may be eligible for.""

The military personnel will begin arriving in California within the next 10 days and assist at state vaccination sites there, said Covid-19 coordinator Jeffrey Zients. The Pentagon is still weighing a broader request from FEMA for up to 10,000 troops, a U.S. military officer said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made the decision, which will involve units from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps and include nurses and medical staff who will be administering the vaccinations, the officer said.

“The military’s critical role in supporting sites will help vaccinate thousands of people per day, and ensure that every American who wants a vaccine will receive one,” said Zients.

The increased involvement of the Defense Department is a shift in strategy from the Trump administration, which primarily left it to the states to figure out how to get shots in the arms of their residents.

Earlier this week, the Biden administration announced it would begin opening the two federally run and funded vaccination sites in California.

2021-02-05 01:02:05+00:00,40,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are divided on who should get the next round of stimulus payments, setting up a dispute as they try to approve $1,400 checks in the next Covid-19 relief package.

The most recent round of stimulus checks were cut off for people making more than $99,000 a year, or couples that made above $198,000. President Joe Biden recommended the same threshold in his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.

But some Democrats want to see that income cap lowered.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wants to ""ensure upper-income taxpayers are not eligible"" for the checks, according to a nonbinding amendment he and several other Democrats plan to push during votes on budget documents.

But Manchin's text doesn't define ""upper income"" — a term that has been used by lawmakers to describe a wide range of wealth.

And even the co-sponsors of Manchin's amendment disagree on what the threshold should be.

Manchin wants no checks for individuals making more than $75,000 per year, or couples making $150,000, his office said. He wants the amount to start phasing down at $50,000 per person, or $100,000 per couple.

""We cannot cut off relief at $50k. It is shockingly out of touch to assert that $50k is 'too wealthy' to receive relief,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Friday evening. ""Millions are on the brink of eviction. Give too little and they’re devastated. Give 'too much' and a single mom might save for a rainy day. This isn’t hard.""

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who backs Manchin's amendment, said he doesn't have a ""detailed threshold in mind"" but that he believes it should be ""refined.""

""I do think it needs to be reduced from what the president has proposed,"" King said.

The Manchin amendment passed by a vote of 99-1 as part of the ""vote-a-rama"" on Thursday, as part of the budget vehicle Democrats are using to pass a bill without requiring GOP support. But that was not an indicator of agreement — after all, senators define ""upper-income"" differently.

Apart from Manchin and King, the Democratic co-sponsors were Jon Tester of Montana, Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, and Mark Warner of Virginia.

The amendment comes after Biden told Democrats in a Wednesday call that he won't compromise on the $1,400 amount for payments, because he's ""not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to the American people."" But he opened the door to adjusting the income levels.

""Maybe we can — I think we can better target that number. I'm OK with that,"" he told Democrats, according to a source on the call.

Asked how he defines upper-income, Tester said: ""I guess that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it depends on who you want to talk to. But I think the point of the amendment is, it’s negotiable so we can try to get some folks on board.""

“Joe called me up on it, I said, ‘Joe, sounds reasonable.’ That’s the reason Joe gave me. And I agree,"" Tester said.

In a clip of a wide-ranging interview with CBS News, Biden said that he is open to negotiating who is eligible for stimulus checks.

""I'm prepared to negotiate on that. But here's the deal middle-class folks need help. But you don't need to get any help to someone making 300,000 bucks or $250,000,"" said Biden, who also said he would consider stripping former President Donald Trump of access to intelligence briefings.

""So it's somewhere between an individual making up to $75,000 and phasing out, and a couple making up to $150,000 and then phasing out. But again, I'm wide open on what that is.""

But some top Democrats don't want to lower the eligibility level for checks.

Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who will be a key figure in crafting the reconciliation legislation, told NBC News he's ""not for changing the threshold"" because that would exclude many Americans who are expecting relief.

""The people who got two checks already are expecting a third on the basis of the pledges and what was said through the campaign,"" he said Thursday. ""They have bills piling up, and they have difficulty paying their car insurance.""

Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is shepherding the reconciliation process, said he will ""insist"" on a threshold of $75,000 per person and $150,000 per couple before it begins to phase down — the same eligibility as the last direct payment.

He said Democrats agree that Americans making more than that shouldn't get payments.

""I don't think there's much argument — we don't want to see people making $300,000 to $400,000 benefit from this,"" he said.

Among the Democrats opposed a lower cutoff is Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who won a competitive Jan. 6 runoff after campaigning heavily on the stimulus checks.

""I'm advocating that we go big, and that we deliver as much direct relief to the people as we can,"" Ossoff said Thursday.",MSNBC,"['democrats', 'relief', 'joe', 'amendment', 'making', 'dont', 'senate', 'receive', 'think', 'split', 'stimulus', 'threshold', '1400', 'checks']",0
2021-02-05 00:45:05+00:00,20,"WASHINGTON — A group of moderate House Democrats is urging their leadership to strike a quick deal to fund vaccine development and distribution and leave the rest of President Joe Biden's sprawling Covid-19 relief plan for later.

""We believe a standalone vaccine bill would pass the House, obtain at least 60 votes in the Senate, and could be signed into law by President Biden this month,"" four leaders of the House's Blue Dog Coalition wrote in a letter sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Thursday.

""It is hard for us to understand why our constituents and our states should have to wait until March or even April for us to deliver essential support for our nation’s vaccination efforts, if we have the votes to pass a standalone bill this month.""

Biden's $1.9 trillion aid package, which includes $20 billion for vaccine distribution, still faces a difficult fight in the Senate despite Democratic efforts to move quickly to use procedural measures to circumvent the usual 60-vote threshold that would require them to get Republican support.

A group of 10 Senate Republicans made a $618 billion counteroffer, which also includes money to bolster vaccinations and testing.

""People are desperate to get access to the vaccine,"" Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., who signed the letter, said in an interview with NBC News Thursday. ""This vaccine money can get out without having an impact on the reconciliation process, which also needs to move quickly.""

Approving money sooner would help Biden accomplish his promise to deliver 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, she added.

But the White House and congressional Democratic leaders appear unwilling to approve a smaller deal and want to push Biden's proposal through both chambers on the strength of Democratic votes alone. That process, the Blue Dogs worry, is not fast enough to keep up with a virus that is still spreading and adapting.

Democratic leaders say they hope to be able to wrap up this new round of relief by March 14, when more-generous unemployment insurance benefits are due to expire. But the process is complex and requires both chambers to move fluidly in concert with each other.

The White House has shown no appetite for breaking out portions of Biden's plan, and Pelosi and Schumer have been in lock step with Biden. Some Democrats fear that breaking it into two pieces — a regular bill for vaccine money and reconciliation for the rest — would rob the plan of some if its allure to lawmakers who are less thrilled about other components.

The letter, also signed by Blue Dog Reps. Tom O'Halleran of Arizona, Ed Case of Hawaii and Kurt Schrader of Oregon, does not make any threat to withhold support for an eventual reconciliation bill.

But Murphy said that it is ""highly cynical"" for anyone to slow-walk vaccine money on the basis that it ""would affect their leverage"" in reconciliation.",MSNBC,"['process', 'house', 'vaccine', 'sprawling', 'moderate', 'letter', 'relief', 'senate', 'votes', 'reconciliation', 'democrats', 'funding', 'plan', 'push', 'money', 'bill', 'signed', 'separate', 'covid']",0
2021-02-04 23:18:34+00:00,109,"Johnson & Johnson applied to the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday for emergency use authorization for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA could grant the authorization within weeks.

If it is authorized, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine would be the third approved in the U.S., joining the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""Today's submission for emergency use authorization of our investigational single-shot Covid-19 vaccine is a pivotal step toward reducing the burden of disease for people globally and putting an end to the pandemic,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer, said in a news release.

Shortly after Johnson & Johnson applied for emergency use, the FDA announced plans for its vaccine advisory panel to meet on Feb. 26 to discuss the request. The Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will evaluate safety and effectiveness data from the vaccine trials and vote whether to recommend authorization. The FDA isn’t obligated to go along with the panel’s recommendation, but it usually does.

If the FDA grants the authorization, Stoffels said, the company will be ready to begin shipping vaccines. It is unclear how many doses would be ready immediately; Johnson & Johnson has previously said it expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, made in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, requires only basic refrigeration and is given as a single dose. Other vaccines, including Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's, as well as vaccines being studied by AstraZeneca and Novavax, require two doses.

In Phase 3 clinical trials, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine prevented all hospitalizations and deaths in people four weeks after they received the shot, the company said last week. Notably, the effects were observed in people infected with virus variants from the U.K. and South Africa, which can hinder vaccine efficacy.

That was apparent when the Phase 3 clinical trial findings were broken down by region. In the U.S., the vaccine was 72 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe disease, while in South Africa, it was 57 percent effective.

When researchers looked just at the shot's effect on severe disease, it was shown to be 85 percent effective globally.

On a call with reporters last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said keeping people out of the hospital and preventing severe illness is ""the most important thing.""

""If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress"" on the health care system, Fauci said.

Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's trials were designed to examine the impact of two doses. Johnson & Johnson's trial limited the research so far to one dose, although studies of a booster shot continue.

Johnson & Johnson's vaccine uses an inactivated common cold virus, called an adenovirus, to teach the immune system to recognize and fight off SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. That is a different approach from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which use genetic material called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to train the immune system.

2021-02-04 20:31:05+00:00,62,"Nobody said that getting President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 stimulus package through Congress would be easy. But Republicans really have chosen to make it as hard as possible, and for the flimsiest of reasons.

Democrats should absolutely do what it takes to win over GOP support and reduce the debt this package would incur.

We hear two main categories of complaint from GOP senators. First, that the bill is too large, too soon and, most important, that the U.S. can’t be adding this much to the deficit even though the country has been dealing with a pandemic for almost a full year. Second, they object to Democrats setting themselves up to pass the package without Republican votes if necessary.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell even promised on Wednesday to force Democrats to vote on things even the GOP doesn’t want to pass, as punishment for moving so quickly and without Republicans’ input on how to help fewer Americans.

Look, folks, the fact is the $1.9 trillion package Biden laid out might get whittled down some during the bipartisan negotiations underway. But I’m willing to bet that anything that costs much more than the minimalist proposal a group of Republican senators produced won’t gain many — if any — GOP votes in the process.

I’ve been through why Republicans suddenly thinking deficits are bad again was both long-coming and completely ridiculous. But let’s take them at their word for a minute.

In that case, Democrats should absolutely do what it takes to win over GOP support and reduce the debt this package would incur. The easiest solution: put the Trump tax cuts on the table.

All together Biden’s proposed changes are poised to raise federal coffers by at least $3.1 trillion over the next decade.

It makes perfect sense. In 2017, the GOP-controlled Congress used budget reconciliation to pass the changes to the tax code that ended up costing up to $2 trillion in lost revenue for the United States over the next decade. That in turn prompted the federal debt to balloon by $3.9 trillion during former President Donald Trump’s term. (We’ll leave aside the massive hole blown into the budget last year thanks to the pandemic.)

So, if we’re to take Republican demands that the deficit be kept down seriously, it’s only fair to look at new revenue, which was not included in the original package.

Now, Biden has said that he doesn’t want to roll back all of the Trump tax cuts — just those on the wealthy and corporations, which feels fair in the middle of a pandemic. You don’t necessarily want to raise taxes on the people whose wages have failed to keep up with inflation. According to a New York Times analysis, doing so would net about $500 billion over the next 10 years.

If that’s not enough to offset the deficit in Republican eyes, well, good thing there’s the rest of Biden’s tax plan to add in. All together Biden’s proposed changes are poised to raise federal coffers by at least $3.1 trillion over the next decade, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates. May as well get that in the stimulus package, too, if this is what Republicans really want to argue.

OK, so that’s more than the cost of the full package and then some covered with new revenue increases. Will that win over moderates in support of Biden’s complete proposal? Not likely. As part of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s confirmation, Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Rob Portman of Ohio — both GOP members of the moderate bipartisan negotiating group I mentioned earlier — peppered her with written questions expressing concerns about repealing the Trump cuts. The rest of the caucus doesn’t seem too thrilled either.

Why wait for another fight when it’s clear that this one has already escalated?

But repeal would do a few things that will be helpful in the long run: First, it would actually begin adding the revenue that Biden will need for the rest of his agenda.

Democrats should absolutely do what it takes to win over GOP support and reduce the debt this package would incur.

We hear two main categories of complaint from GOP senators. First, that the bill is too large, too soon and, most important, that the U.S. can’t be adding this much to the deficit even though the country has been dealing with a pandemic for almost a full year. Second, they object to Democrats setting themselves up to pass the package without Republican votes if necessary.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell even promised on Wednesday to force Democrats to vote on things even the GOP doesn’t want to pass, as punishment for moving so quickly and without Republicans’ input on how to help fewer Americans.

Look, folks, the fact is the $1.9 trillion package Biden laid out might get whittled down some during the bipartisan negotiations underway. But I’m willing to bet that anything that costs much more than the minimalist proposal a group of Republican senators produced won’t gain many — if any — GOP votes in the process.

I’ve been through why Republicans suddenly thinking deficits are bad again was both long-coming and completely ridiculous. But let’s take them at their word for a minute.

In that case, Democrats should absolutely do what it takes to win over GOP support and reduce the debt this package would incur. The easiest solution: put the Trump tax cuts on the table.

All together Biden’s proposed changes are poised to raise federal coffers by at least $3.1 trillion over the next decade.

It makes perfect sense. In 2017, the GOP-controlled Congress used budget reconciliation to pass the changes to the tax code that ended up costing up to $2 trillion in lost revenue for the United States over the next decade. That in turn prompted the federal debt to balloon by $3.9 trillion during former President Donald Trump’s term. (We’ll leave aside the massive hole blown into the budget last year thanks to the pandemic.)

So, if we’re to take Republican demands that the deficit be kept down seriously, it’s only fair to look at new revenue, which was not included in the original package.

Now, Biden has said that he doesn’t want to roll back all of the Trump tax cuts — just those on the wealthy and corporations, which feels fair in the middle of a pandemic. You don’t necessarily want to raise taxes on the people whose wages have failed to keep up with inflation. According to a New York Times analysis, doing so would net about $500 billion over the next 10 years.

If that’s not enough to offset the deficit in Republican eyes, well, good thing there’s the rest of Biden’s tax plan to add in. All together Biden’s proposed changes are poised to raise federal coffers by at least $3.1 trillion over the next decade, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates. May as well get that in the stimulus package, too, if this is what Republicans really want to argue.

OK, so that’s more than the cost of the full package and then some covered with new revenue increases. Will that win over moderates in support of Biden’s complete proposal? Not likely. As part of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s confirmation, Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Rob Portman of Ohio — both GOP members of the moderate bipartisan negotiating group I mentioned earlier — peppered her with written questions expressing concerns about repealing the Trump cuts. The rest of the caucus doesn’t seem too thrilled either.

2021-02-04 15:04:03+00:00,59,"They were the original Code Talkers, Native American soldiers sent to fight in France a century ago who relayed orders from the trenches in Cherokee to confuse the enemy and help the Allies secure victory during World War I.

Then, the Germans were the foe. Now, it's Covid-19.

While the rollout of coronavirus vaccinations has been chaotic and resisted by some of the public, the Cherokee have quietly mobilized their members to get as many needles into as many arms as soon as possible, starting with some of the most endangered members of the tribe — those who still speak Cherokee.

""We put Cherokee-fluent speakers, most of whom are elders, at the front of the line,"" Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., leader of the 385,000-strong Cherokee Nation, said on a Zoom call from the reservation in Oklahoma. ""The reason is that our language is at risk.""

Tribal leaders and activists across the country have harnessed the reverence for Native American culture and tradition to vaccinate a people that has deep-rooted fears and suspicions of the U.S. government and the medical establishment.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""We are more at risk because we've had to deal with 500 years of oppression,"" said Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Seattle-based Urban Indian Health Institute, who said some of the Native American women who were forcibly sterilized in the 1960s and the 1970s are still alive.

But a survey of 1,435 Native Americans across the country spearheaded by Echo-Hawk in November also revealed that 75 percent would be willing to be vaccinated, not because they suddenly trust Uncle Sam, but because they put the ""we"" ahead of the ""me.""

""The primary motivation for participants who indicated willingness to get vaccinated was a strong sense of responsibility to protect the Native community and preserve cultural ways,"" a summary of the report said. ""Despite hesitancy towards the vaccine due to historical and current abuse from healthcare and government institutions, they ultimately felt that the heavy cost of COVID-19 on their community outweighed potential risks from the vaccine.""

So Native American leaders are selling their people on vaccinations by emphasizing the good they could do for the tribe, as opposed to the individual, Echo-Hawk said. And it appears to be working.

The Seattle Indian Health Board gets about 7,000 calls a month, Echo-Hawk said. On Monday, it got 4,900 calls from Native Americans seeking vaccine information. ""It crashed our system,"" she said.

The Cherokee nation, as of Wednesday, had been able to vaccinate 12,000 people.

Hoskin said: ""When fluent speakers got the vaccine, I think that helped people's anxiety subside. And I think people felt sort of a renewed obligation to try and protect the culture by getting vaccinated.""

Not all the Cherokee speakers who got the first shots are over 65, Hoskin said. But the tribe was able to prioritize who was vaccinated first because it answers to the Indian Health Service, a federal agency, rather than the state of Oklahoma, which has put most people under age 65 in Phase 4 of its rollout.

""I like to think a lot of Cherokee leaders feel like this,"" Hoskin said. ""You've got your ancestors at your back.""

Only about 22,000 people speak Cherokee, a language that began to decline after the tribe was forced out of North Carolina and marched off to Oklahoma in the 1830s on the Trail of Tears. But along with other Native languages, like Navajo and Choctaw, it was deployed by the U.S. to fool the enemy in both world wars.

The pandemic has hit Indigenous people like the Cherokee, the largest Native American tribe in the U.S., especially hard, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Native Americans are 3.5 times more likely to contract Covid-19 and 1.8 times more likely to die from the coronavirus than white people, the CDC found.

Why? Poverty and poor medical care, along with higher rates of asthma and diabetes, are the chief culprits, Echo-Hawk said. In addition, many Native Americans live in multigenerational and often crowded households.

When the vaccines made their debut in December and the government began encouraging Americans to be vaccinated, tribal leaders eager to protect their members volunteered to roll up their sleeves to get the first doses.

""We wanted to reassure our people that it was safe,"" said Donny Stevenson, vice chairman of the Muckleshoot Tribe.

The tribe, most of whom live on a reservation about 30 miles south of Seattle, also emailed a digital newsletter to computer-savvy members and held Zoom meetings that included trusted health professionals.

Meanwhile, the elders got paper copies of the newsletter with the free lunches that are regularly delivered to their doorsteps.

Stevenson said that because of the strategy, which promoted mask-wearing and social distancing, there was very little community spread on the reservation. And on Sunday, it saw proof that its drive to vaccinate tribe members was working when hundreds of cars arrived at the reservation's health clinic for a vaccination drive-in sponsored by the tribe.

About a quarter of the 3,300 enrolled members of the tribe have been vaccinated, Stevenson said.

Echo-Hawk said the rest of the country could learn something from its original inhabitants.

""Our community is behaving differently,"" Echo-Hawk said. ""Whenever there's discussions about Native Americans, it seems like they always talk about the problems, but they need to come to us, because we have the answers.

In a since-deleted post on social media, Stacey Griffith, a New York-based fitness instructor, said she filled out paperwork and drove an hour to Staten Island to receive her first dose of the Moderna vaccine, according to The Daily Beast.

""Now I can teach @soulcycle with a little more faith that we're all gonna be ok if we get the [vaccine],"" Griffith's post read. She told The Daily Beast that her role as an ""educator"" made her eligible to get in the front of the line for a vaccination.

Her post raised questions and sparked outrage. Mayor Bill de Blasio also called out Griffith's vaccination as problematic.

""Doesn't sound like someone who should have gotten vaccinated to me,” he said Sunday at a news conference. ""I don't think someone who shows up and says, 'Hey, I'm a Soul Cycle instructor,' should have qualified unless there's some other factor there. That should have been caught in the application process.”

Initially, Griffith, 52, defended her decision to jump the line and get the Covid-19 jab along with other educators.

""All teachers are eligible to apply for the vaccine. My post today was to show my confidence in the system, in our government, and I hope everyone can at least feel more at ease knowing I went through the process,"" she told The Daily Beast.

On Monday, however, Griffith backpedaled and posted a public apology on her Instagram page.

""I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for my recent action in receiving the vaccine,"" Griffith wrote. ""I made a terrible error in judgment and for that I am truly sorry.""

The spin instructor did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment, and SoulCycle said Griffith operated in a ""personal capacity"" in applying for the vaccine.

""SoulCycle plays no role in organizing or obtaining vaccinations for instructors or other employees, nor do we encourage any of our SoulCycle employees to seek vaccine priority as educators,"" a SoulCycle spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday.

As of now, those who are eligible in New York City for the vaccine include people 65 and older, public-facing grocery store workers, first responders, teachers and school administrators, public transit operators, and people living and working in homeless shelters. But it does not include gym employees or fitness instructors.

2021-02-04 00:04:04+00:00,41,"WASHINGTON — The federal government will open its first Covid-19 vaccination sites in California as part of the Biden administration’s push to ramp up the number of Americans receiving shots and reach those most at risk of developing severe illness.

One center will be housed in the Oakland Coliseum where the Oakland Athletics baseball team plays and the other will be on the campus of California State University, Los Angeles. Both will be adjacent to communities hardest hit by the pandemic, said Jeffrey Zients, President Joe Biden's lead Covid-19 coordinator. The facilities will be staffed mostly with federal employees.

“These sites in California are just the beginning,” Zients said. “We are working with, in partnership, in states across the country to stand up new sites and will have more to say on that in the coming weeks.”

The effort is a change in course from the Trump administration, which left the administration of the vaccine largely to the states and focused instead on the logistics of shipping the vaccine. But after states became overwhelmed in the early weeks trying to manage the demand from people seeking the vaccine, Biden’s Covid-19 advisers urged him to take a more hands-on approach.

The federal vaccination centers — which will be based in stadiums, school gyms and parking lots — will be staffed by workers from FEMA, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Defense Department will also play a role in managing these community vaccination sites.

The Biden administration has been increasing the number of federal employees working on the effort and currently has directed 600 FEMA employees to work on the vaccination program, including 350 working at vaccination sites, in addition to thousands of National Guard members in 39 states.

Several states have already begun using stadiums as mass vaccination centers.

FEMA has provided $1.7 billion to 27 states to help pay for transportation, storage, and supplies for their vaccination programs, Zients said.

The administration announced yesterday it would begin shipping vaccines directly to retail pharmacies and has increased shipments to states by 20 percent over the past two weeks.

Administration officials said they are in a race against time to increase the number of Americans vaccinated as more contagious strains of the virus continue to spread across the country even as deaths and hospitalizations begin to trend downward. In the meantime, they urged the public to double down on mask-wearing and avoid large gatherings, like Super Bowl parties.

""We have to be concerned about the mutants,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration's top infectious disease adviser. ""Viruses will not mutate well If you don't give them the opportunity to replicate in a very large way. Namely, if you have an open playing field for the virus, they will replicate and they will mutate.""",MSNBC,"['department', 'states', 'working', 'administration', 'sites', 'opening', 'zients', 'mass', 'federal', 'california', 'vaccine', 'number', 'covid', 'vaccination']",0

2021-02-02 20:02:04+00:00,101,"On the surface, there appears to be a predictable partisan split on the COVID relief package, with most Democrats eyeing an ambitious approach that would give the economy an enormous boost, as Republicans eye a meager response.

But there are exceptions to the partisan divide. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice -- the Republican governor of a state Donald Trump carried by nearly 40 points -- argued yesterday that Congress has a responsibility to pursue the most ambitious course possible. TPM noted:

Justice dismissed the idea of being ""fiscally responsible"" in a time when many Americans are struggling to get by. ""We need to understand that trying to be, per se, fiscally responsible at this point in time with what we've got going on in this country -- if we actually throw away some money right now, so what?"" Justice said. ""We have really got to move and get people taken care of and get people back on balance.""

Asked about Sen. Joe Manchin's (D-W.Va.) skepticism about the benefits of direct-aid checks to working-class families, the Republican governor from Manchin's home state added, ""I mean, we got people that are really hurting. I mean, that's just all there is to it.""

Soon after, Justice also spoke to MSNBC's Craig Melvin and said, in reference to congressional efforts, ""I absolutely believe we need to go big.... At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We need to quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the cows and just move. And move forward and move right now.""

I can't say with confidence exactly what that metaphor meant, but the West Virginian's underlying point was obvious.

As for why interviews like these matter, Justice's comments certainly extend some partisan cover to Joe Manchin, to the extent that he wants or needs it. Congress' most conservative Democrat hasn't yet said whether he's prepared to support his party's ambitious COVID relief package, but having his state's Republican governor effectively endorse the Democratic approach should give the senator some added encouragement to do the right thing.

What's more, as the debate moves forward, Democratic leaders will no doubt be eager to push back against claims that their relief plan is ""partisan"" by pointing to comments like Justice's.",MSNBC,"['republican', 'relief', 'point', 'ambitious', 'congress', 'redstate', 'urges', 'plan', 'big', 'west', 'justice', 'governor', 'partisan', 'right', 'need', 'gop']",0

2021-02-02 12:02:04+00:00,35,"WASHINGTON — Democrats considering a maneuver to forgo bipartisan support to pass Covid-19 relief are confronting an unintended consequence: Doing so could automatically cut Medicare.

Many Democrats want to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief proposal, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks and aid to local governments. A group of Republican senators is pushing for a smaller plan that would provide $1,000 checks.

So Democratic leaders are preparing to use a process known as budget reconciliation, which would allow them to pass Biden's proposal without getting 60 votes in the Senate, which would require at least 10 Republicans.

But under the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, known as PAYGO, new laws that raise the national debt automatically trigger offsetting cuts in some safety net programs.

The cuts can be avoided, budget experts say, only with 60 Senate votes — leaving Democrats back where they started, because it's unclear whether Republicans would vote to prevent the cuts after having opposed a partisan relief package.

""It's Medicare. It's farm subsidies,"" said Marc Goldwein, a budget expert at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""It's a bunch of programs that would be cut.""

The size of the reductions in Medicare and other social safety net program would depend on the size of the package, but they'd be significant even if the price tag fell under $1 trillion. Social Security and low-income programs would be exempt.

""The cuts would be huge,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. ""It's a critical issue, which, at some point, is going to have to be dealt with.""

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who will shepherd the reconciliation process and has been a supporter of expanding safety net programs, will work to prevent the cuts, said his spokesman, Keane Bhatt.

Bhatt pointed to the last time budget reconciliation was used to make a big change — when Republicans passed a costly tax cut on a partisan vote, which triggered $25 billion in Medicare cuts. But Democrats joined Republicans to prevent the cuts from taking effect in a government funding measure that was passed subsequently.

""Trump and his Republican colleagues used deficit spending to pass $2 trillion in tax breaks overwhelmingly benefiting the wealthiest and large corporations and expanding a military budget with a Pentagon that has never been independently audited,"" Bhatt said. ""When it comes to feeding children who are hungry or treating people who are sick in the middle of a pandemic, funding cuts due to supposed concerns over the deficit would be unacceptable and immoral.""

There may be other ways to stop the cuts, but they'd be difficult in practice, Van de Water said.

Congress could declare the relief bill an emergency measure, which would exempt it from PAYGO — but adding such a provision would be likely to take 60 votes. Lawmakers could try to use a future reconciliation bill to shut off the automatic cuts, but that would create a cascading effect of, in essence, borrowing from the future, he said.

Congress would have until the end of 2021 to prevent the cuts, and it could do so in any bill under the regular process, said Bill Dauster, who was a policy aide when Harry Reid of Nevada was the to Senate Democratic leader.

""All of God's children should want to avoid a sequester in Medicare and other entitlements,"" he said. ""There are reasonable incentives to want to avoid it again this year.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a budget measure Monday that would lay the groundwork to use reconciliation. They said it doesn't preclude a bipartisan package.

""The only thing we cannot accept is a package that is too small or too narrow to pull our country out of this emergency,"" Schumer said. ""We cannot repeat the mistake of 2009.""

Alternatively, Democrats could negate the automatic cuts if they raise taxes to prevent adding to the debt or abolish the filibuster, another political can of worms.

Goldwein said forcing Congress to worry about the debt was the purpose of the 2010 law.

2021-02-02 04:17:03+00:00,14,"Chicago's public students will continue remote instruction as the mayor and the teachers union continue discussions about plans to resume in-person education amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the CEO of Chicago Public Schools called for a 48-hour ""cooling off period"" but said teachers who have worked remotely will retain access to their online teaching tool, Google Suite.

The Chicago Teachers Union said that means management is holding off on threats to lock out tens of thousands of teachers. The union president expressed a hopeful tone.

""We don’t want a strike. We want to keep working remotely as we bargain an agreement to return to our classrooms safely,"" union President Jesse Sharkey said in a statement. ""And we're one step closer to that goal today, because management has agreed to stay at the table rather than escalating conflict or locking out educators.""

Teachers in the nation's third-largest school district voted late last month to continue to work remotely, saying the district was insisting teachers return to unsafe buildings.

Roughly 62,000 students and about 10,000 teachers and staff in K-8 were expected to return to in-class learning Monday for the first time since last March, part of the district’s gradual reopening plans.

Testing, vaccinations and the adoption of Covid-19 health metrics have all been cited by the union as sticking points, among other issues.

The mayor and schools CEO said Monday that they had reached an ""important milestone"" and that students will continue learning virtually Tuesday and Wednesday.

""We have secured agreement on one other open issue and made substantial progress on a framework that we hope will address the remaining issues,"" Lightfoot and CEO Janice K. Jackson said in a joint statement. ""We are calling for a 48-hour cooling off period that will hopefully lead to a final resolution on all open issues.""

The union's statement did not appear to mention a cooling-off period, but Sharkey said they made ""real progress at the bargaining table today on a number of the most difficult issues of this negotiation.""

The union says it has nearly 25,000 teachers and educational support personnel. There are around 340,000 students in the school district.

The mayor and schools CEO said in a statement Saturday that tentative agreements had been reached on issues that include temperature checks and other health measures, ventilation of buildings and contact tracing.

Illinois recently rolled out its latest vaccine phase that includes residents ages 65 and older and teachers. But districtwide efforts to vaccinate teachers won’t begin until the middle of February. City officials say there are many priority groups and not enough doses.

Lightfoot said on MSNBC Monday morning that ""our schools are safe."" She said the city invested over $100 million in ventilation and other safety measures.

The union said Friday it needs ""real progress in critical areas,"" and among other issues has called for is a ""phased-in return tied to voluntary vaccination"" and accommodations for educators who have household members that are at a higher risk of illness and death from Covid-19.

The $230 million deal the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services struck with Ellume will allow the company ""to scale the manufacturing base and capacity of this easy-to-use test,"" Slavitt said. ""Thanks to this contract, they’ll be able to scale the production to manufacture over 19 million test kits per month by the end of this year, 8.5 million of which are guaranteed to the U.S. government.""

The test by Ellume, an Australian digital diagnostics company, does not require sending samples to a lab, is similar to how at-home pregnancy tests work, and is ""appropriate for people ages 2 and older,"" Slavitt said.

He said the test uses a ""mid-turbinate nasal swab,"" which is less invasive than the original deep nasal swabs used at the beginning of the outbreak.

The antigen test involves collecting a sample with a nasal swab that users then place into a Bluetooth-connected analyzer that syncs with a smartphone app.

""After you take the swab, you put the sample into a digital analyzer, which will send a result to your smartphone in about 15 minutes,"" Slavitt said.

He called the news ""exciting,"" and said he hoped the price would come down when there are more tests in production.

""Making easier to use tests available to every American is a high priority with obvious benefits,"" Slavitt said.

The at-home test correctly identified 96 percent of positive samples and 100 percent of negative samples in people with symptoms of Covid-19, the FDA said. In people who are not symptomatic, the test correctly identified 91 percent of positive samples and 96 percent of negative samples.

In a statement, the company said the deal ""includes funding to support the establishment of Ellume’s U.S.-based manufacturing facility,"" and that the factory would produce up to 500,000 tests a day. A spokeswoman for the company said the location is still being finalized.

The tests will be available over the counter in pharmacies, drug stores and online, the company told NBC News in an email last month.

Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital who has studied dozens of types of Covid-19 rapid tests, called the government's investment ""a step forward in giving Americans access to at-home rapid testing,"" but said more needs to be done to turn the tide.

""In order for us to stop the spread of the virus, we need to scale cheap and simple paper-strip antigen tests that a majority of Americans can afford to use frequently,"" Mina told NBC News.

The Ellume test is one of three at-home tests hitting the market soon.",MSNBC,"['strikes', 'test', 'covid19', 'tests', 'overthecounter', 'production', 'slavitt', 'deal', 'million', 'company', 'ellume', 'samples', 'athome', 'covid', '230']",0
2021-02-01 22:29:05+00:00,51,"As Democratic officials move forward with an ambitious COVID relief package, Senate Republicans have focused on two principal concerns. The first is that it would hurt their feelings if the Democratic majority passed a bill without them -- a complaint that no one should take seriously for all sorts of reasons.

But the second GOP talking point is that the existing proposal, presented weeks ago by President Joe Biden's White House, would do too much to help the economy and struggling Americans. What kind of proposal do Republicans have in mind? Over the weekend, their vision came into sharper focus.

The Republicans' proposed package is much smaller than Biden's $1.9 trillion proposal, and includes $160 billion for vaccines, $4 billion for health and substance abuse services, the continuation of current unemployment aid and unspecified ""targeted"" economic assistance and help for schools.

All told, the GOP blueprint would carry a roughly $600 billion price tag, which is less than a third of what the White House has said is necessary to deliver meaningful economic results. That said, the Republicans' proposal, presented to the White House in a written letter issued on Saturday, was signed by 10 GOP senators, which is a notable number: to overcome a Republican filibuster, a proposal would need at least 10 members of the Senate minority to vote for it. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who's helped spearhead this effort, has apparently lined up the 10 votes.

Alternatively, of course, Democrats could simply take advantage of the budget reconciliation process, pass their own bill, and move on to the next policy priority.

But Republicans hope to prevent such an outcome with their counter-offer that's difficult to take seriously. As a Washington Post analysis noted, this GOP contingent effectively took Biden's plan, scrapped aid to state and cities, eliminated the minimum wage increase, slashed the value of direct-aid checks, limited the number of middle-class households that could receive direct-aid checks, and cut supplemental unemployment benefits.

And why in the world would Democrats scrap their superior bill, on purpose, which they can pass on their own, to instead embrace a meager Republican alternative? Because, some GOP senators said yesterday, it would signify ""bipartisanship"" and ""unity.""

The game is insulting in its inanity: Republicans apparently expect people to believe legislation should be assessed, not on its merits, but in its capacity to make the GOP minority happy. Biden can sign a good bill or a bipartisan one, and Republicans want the new president to prioritize the latter over the former.

As foolish as this sounds, the 10 senators who presented the pitch requested a meeting with the president to discuss the matter in more detail. Late yesterday, the White House agreed to the meeting, which could happen as early as today.

What's less clear is what, exactly, this meeting is intended to do. Is the goal to persuade these Republicans to endorse the more ambitious bill? Does the president intend to defend use of the reconciliation process? Is there a plan to strike some kind of split-the-difference compromise between the two proposals?

For now, the answers are far from clear. At face value, it appears a group of senators requested time with the president, and Biden has agreed to hear them out. The next step remains uncertain.

In the meantime, on Capitol Hill, congressional Democrats are planning to approve reconciliation resolutions as early as this week, which would provide them with the legislative foundation needed to pass any COVID relief bill they want, whether Republicans like it or not.",MSNBC,"['bill', 'reconciliation', 'relief', 'package', 'president', 'house', 'offer', 'problem', 'white', 'presented', 'senators', 'republicans', 'proposal', 'covid', 'gop']",0

The Affordable Care Act, now over a decade old, was no panacea, but was a promising step.

The Affordable Care Act, over a decade old this year, was no panacea, but it was a promising step, albeit one that had been undermined significantly by the Republican Party and the Trump administration. But elections have consequences. And in this case, they can be great ones, such as the recent executive order to expand health care access to a potential 15 million Americans.

Maria (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy) is a 44-year-old Hispanic woman who lives in San Antonio. She has a full-time job as a manager at a local grocery store, where she supervises around 16 employees and makes about $42,000 a year. Maria loves to watch the San Antonio Spurs, enjoys a great margarita and works seven days a week.

She lives in the same neighborhood as the store where she works, and she often spends part of her paycheck on groceries for the growing number of her neighbors who have reported food insecurity. In Maria’s words, “That’s just life.”

Maria and I grew up and went to school together. In the early part of the pandemic, she would often call me and ask me what was happening and what advice I had for her to avoid getting sick. I told her that in addition to being careful at the store, wearing a mask and washing her hands, she needed to get health insurance. She is the sole provider for her two children and, like many Americans, works full time but has no health care benefits.

Texas is one of 12 states that did not expand their Medicaid programs

Texas is one of 12 states that did not expand their Medicaid programs despite the federal government initially fully subsidizing the costs of the expansion through the Affordable Care Act. Maria, like many others, found the website confusing, the choices complicated (what is the difference between a silver and gold plan, anyway?) and at the end of the process felt like there was no way she could afford the suggested premium payments.

So Maria, like millions of others, was left to try and figure out how to find low-cost health care on her own. She utilizes free clinics and tries to manage costs of medications for her son who has asthma. She ironically makes too much money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, so her family faces one of the highest risks possible: They are just one hospitalization away from becoming homeless.

In the past year, she has buried an aunt and an uncle from Covid-19 and watched her son get sick and recover after a long course of illness. As she says, she “has the blessing of God” to keep her healthy so she can earn a paycheck.

The Trump administration slashed the budget for a federal program that helps people like Maria navigate health insurance choices by 80% from 2016 to 2018. Adding insult to injury, in 2017, the Trump administration shut down the enrollment website for “maintenance” on Sundays, a day when many people might actually have the opportunity to sit down and enroll in a health insurance plan.

President Joe Biden recently signed several critical executive orders that might seem nominal but could have the most significant impact on so many Americans — including Maria.

First is an order to open a special enrollment period for people to purchase health care coverage from the health insurance marketplace. The enrollment period had been from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31 until it was shorted by President Donald Trump in 2017 in efforts to derail the Affordable Care Act, from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15. Due to the current public health emergency of the pandemic, there was a bit more flexibility with enrollment.

Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration actually used Sundays to shut down the enrollment website for “maintenance.”

The recent executive order will add three more months to enroll in health insurance. This will likely help approximately 15 million uninsured Americans find health care plans, likely in states that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, like Texas. Four million uninsured people would actually qualify for a free plan in the bronze category, with a $0 monthly premium payment.

It is hard to fathom that free health care is within reach and even harder to imagine that there are no gimmicks or strings attached. Opening the enrollment in and of itself is not enough, so we hope to see a restoration of the support services that used to be in place for Maria and many others to understand their options.

Health insurance navigators are incredibly effective, especially in Hispanic communities. The navigators often come from the same communities they serve and are crucial in helping bridge divides such as language, internet access and health literacy and alleviate confusion over cost and pricing.

It is only through augmenting open enrollment with actual navigation services that we can achieve any meaningful access. We know that uninsured patients often delay or avoid necessary care, even when there are assurances that their costs will be covered, such as if it is related to a Covid-19 diagnosis. But doctors don’t like to discuss cost, and people find it hard to ask questions when faced with medical issues.

Biden has made it clear that he will work to eliminate policies that prohibit access, whether they are work requirements in Medicaid (which require proof of work or attempts to find work and have not been shown to do anything other than cut access to people) or policies that actually undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

The Biden administration is starting to return us to the social compact made with our forefathers when the United States of America helped to stitch together a safety net for health, housing, education and food supply.

There’s a long way to go, but the recent actions by the Biden administration are a good start. We will still need ways to make health care affordable, control skyrocketing drug prices and help actually bring care back to health.

She has a full-time job as a manager at a local grocery store, where she supervises around 16 employees and makes about $42,000 a year. Maria loves to watch the San Antonio Spurs, enjoys a great margarita and works seven days a week.

She lives in the same neighborhood as the store where she works, and she often spends part of her paycheck on groceries for the growing number of her neighbors who have reported food insecurity. In Maria’s words, “That’s just life.”

Maria and I grew up and went to school together. In the early part of the pandemic, she would often call me and ask me what was happening and what advice I had for her to avoid getting sick. I told her that in addition to being careful at the store, wearing a mask and washing her hands, she needed to get health insurance. She is the sole provider for her two children and, like many Americans, works full time but has no health care benefits.

Texas is one of 12 states that did not expand their Medicaid programs

Texas is one of 12 states that did not expand their Medicaid programs despite the federal government initially fully subsidizing the costs of the expansion through the Affordable Care Act. Maria, like many others, found the website confusing, the choices complicated (what is the difference between a silver and gold plan, anyway?) and at the end of the process felt like there was no way she could afford the suggested premium payments.

So Maria, like millions of others, was left to try and figure out how to find low-cost health care on her own. She utilizes free clinics and tries to manage costs of medications for her son who has asthma. She ironically makes too much money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, so her family faces one of the highest risks possible: They are just one hospitalization away from becoming homeless.

In the past year, she has buried an aunt and an uncle from Covid-19 and watched her son get sick and recover after a long course of illness. As she says, she “has the blessing of God” to keep her healthy so she can earn a paycheck.

The Trump administration slashed the budget for a federal program that helps people like Maria navigate health insurance choices by 80% from 2016 to 2018. Adding insult to injury, in 2017, the Trump administration shut down the enrollment website for “maintenance” on Sundays, a day when many people might actually have the opportunity to sit down and enroll in a health insurance plan.

President Joe Biden recently signed several critical executive orders that might seem nominal but could have the most significant impact on so many Americans — including Maria.

First is an order to open a special enrollment period for people to purchase health care coverage from the health insurance marketplace. The enrollment period had been from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31 until it was shorted by President Donald Trump in 2017 in efforts to derail the Affordable Care Act, from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15. Due to the current public health emergency of the pandemic, there was a bit more flexibility with enrollment.

Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration actually used Sundays to shut down the enrollment website for “maintenance.”

The recent executive order will add three more months to enroll in health insurance. This will likely help approximately 15 million uninsured Americans find health care plans, likely in states that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, like Texas. Four million uninsured people would actually qualify for a free plan in the bronze category, with a $0 monthly premium payment.

It is hard to fathom that free health care is within reach and even harder to imagine that there are no gimmicks or strings attached. Opening the enrollment in and of itself is not enough, so we hope to see a restoration of the support services that used to be in place for Maria and many others to understand their options.

Health insurance navigators are incredibly effective, especially in Hispanic communities. The navigators often come from the same communities they serve and are crucial in helping bridge divides such as language, internet access and health literacy and alleviate confusion over cost and pricing.

It is only through augmenting open enrollment with actual navigation services that we can achieve any meaningful access. We know that uninsured patients often delay or avoid necessary care, even when there are assurances that their costs will be covered, such as if it is related to a Covid-19 diagnosis. But doctors don’t like to discuss cost, and people find it hard to ask questions when faced with medical issues.

Biden has made it clear that he will work to eliminate policies that prohibit access, whether they are work requirements in Medicaid (which require proof of work or attempts to find work and have not been shown to do anything other than cut access to people) or policies that actually undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

The Biden administration is starting to return us to the social compact made with our forefathers when the United States of America helped to stitch together a safety net for health, housing, education and food supply.

There’s a long way to go, but the recent actions by the Biden administration are a good start. We will still need ways to make health care affordable, control skyrocketing drug prices and help actually bring care back to health. Covid-19 has laid bare the great shortcomings of our health care system, and we will have to work together to create opportunities that will bridge the divide — starting with Maria.",MSNBC,"['enrollment', 'administration', 'health', 'insurance', 'maria', 'care', 'help', 'bidens', 'access', 'trump', 'affordable', 'changes', 'america', 'crushing', 'covid', 'work']",0
2021-02-01 12:32:03+00:00,36,"LOS ANGELES — Anti-vaccine protesters briefly forced officials to close the Covid-19 vaccination site at Dodger Stadium on Saturday as hundreds of people waited in their cars to receive doses, Los Angeles Fire Department officials said.

The fire department closed the stadium entrance for about an hour in the afternoon while protesters attempted to enter the parking lot, where vaccinations were being administered.

No one was arrested, but the Los Angeles Police Department deployed ""a sufficient amount of officers"" to the stadium, a spokesperson said. L.A. police also said that all vaccines would be administered despite the delay.

California ""is working around the clock to provide life-saving vaccines to those on the frontlines of this pandemic,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement posted to Twitter. ""We will not be deterred or threatened.""

Several of the demonstrators were seen not wearing masks and carrying signs suggesting the coronavirus pandemic is a ""scam,"" according to social media posts.

The anti-vaccine protest coincided with Los Angeles County public health officials detecting a second case of the coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, which was first found in the United Kingdom. The new strain is thought to be more contagious than the original coronavirus, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate that it will become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March.

More than 1.1 million Covid-19 cases and 16,647 deaths have been confirmed across Los Angeles County as of Saturday, according to the public health department.

Sir Tom Moore was being treated for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus last week, according to a statement from his daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore. He was admitted to the hospital Sunday for “additional help with his breathing.”

“The medical care he has received in the last few weeks has been remarkable and we know that the wonderful staff at Bedford Hospital will do all that they can to make him comfortable and hopefully return home as soon as possible,” his daughter’s statement said.

He is not in the intensive care unit, according to the statement.

Moore made international headlines last year when he began a fundraising campaign to support the NHS in April, thanks to an idea from his daughter to keep him active during the pandemic. He pledged to walk 100 laps around his 50-yard-long garden before his 100th birthday, and initially hoped to raise 1,000 pounds ($1,244).

His fundraiser ultimately raised 33 million pounds ($41 million) for the country's health service.

The campaign also earned Moore several honors, including a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. The queen, who turned 94 last year, met Moore in an outdoor ceremony in July at Windsor Castle to bestow the distinction. She thanked him for the ""amazing"" amount of money he raised.

2021-01-31 20:34:05+00:00,39,"WASHINGTON — The Covid-19 vaccines are slowly working their way into the U.S. population, promising to tamp down the health ravages of the pandemic. But even after that massive logistical task is complete, economic challenges and changes created by the virus look like they could linger for a long time.

Apart from the doctor appointments and ICU beds, the data show a string of flashing yellow caution lights marking the road to an economic recovery, from unemployment rates to retirement savings.

Let’s start with the number that has dominated the economic discussion around Covid-19: the unemployment rate. Much has been made of the resilience of the U.S. economy over the last year and its bounce back after the crash of last spring has been impressive.

Starting at 3.5 percent in February of 2020, the unemployment rate jumped to 14.8 percent in April before closing the year at 6.7 percent in December. The current unemployment rate is still higher than it was when the pandemic began. In fact, the last time the national number was this high was early 2014. But in context, the figure is still way down from where it was when the economy shut down in April, making it feel like a positive story.

Look under the surface, however, and there are a lot of concerns in the data that could have long-term effects.

A survey from Kiplinger's Personal Finance and Personal Capital released in January found that a third of Americans withdrew or borrowed money from their retirement accounts in 2020. The reason from most of those withdrawals? Simply making ends meet.

And about two-thirds of those redirected retirement money was used for ""living expenses."" In essence, those numbers mean that in 2020 people were pulling money out of their future to pay for their daily lives.

Those are the kinds of choices that change how people live or plan to live in the months and years ahead. They can change spending plans and retirement plans and college enrollment plans. It may take years to see what the real impacts are going to be, but there will be consequences.

On top of that, those relatively rosy unemployment numbers are not as clear as they seem to be at first blush. For many people, their personal situation depends greatly on their race.

That 6.7 percent number isn’t bad, but the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent for African Americans in December. For Hispanics it was 9.3 percent. Those figures are large enough to create high levels or hardship particularly in places with large minority populations. They probably mean employers have permanently shuttered in a lot of communities.

Education also plays big role in employment. For those whose highest level of educational attainment is a high school diploma, the December unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. For those a college degree the figure was only 3.8 percent.

And even before breaking down that 6.7 percent unemployment rate into demographic groups, there is reason to believe the figure is too low and is missing a lot of people who would like to be working.

Since the pandemic began, the number of Americans in the national labor force — that is, people working or actively looking for a job — has declined, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That decline, from 63.3 percent in February to 61.5 percent in December of the working age population “participating” in the labor force, probably doesn’t sound like much of a change. But that 61.5 percent figure is the lowest the labor force participation number has been since the mid 1970s, when women were still entering the workforce.

In real terms it means that there were 4 million fewer people in the labor force in December than there were in February. That's roughly the population of Los Angeles.

Some of those who’ve opted out are probably mothers and fathers who want or need to stay home with school-age children, but others are certainly not in that group. And when the virus is eventually tamed, former workers of many stripes will likely re-enter a labor force and an economy that has been restructured by the pandemic, one with fewer brick-and-mortar retailers, a shrunken hospitality industry and other remade sectors.

No one knows for certain what the post-Covid-19 economy will look like, how many changes were temporary and how many were structural. But regardless of what’s behind the changes, there will be an adjustment period, possibly a lengthy one.

Add it all up and the quest to vaccinate Americans is not just about putting an end to the pandemic in the United States. It's just a step — albeit a crucial one — on a what appears to be a long path ahead.",MSNBC,"['rollout', 'covids', 'force', 'figure', 'labor', 'unemployment', 'economic', 'economy', 'cost', 'pandemic', 'slow', 'americans', 'deepens', 'vaccine', 'rate', 'retirement', 'number']",0
2021-01-31 18:34:02+00:00,107,"WASHINGTON — Michael Osterholm, a top epidemiologist who advised President Joe Biden’s transition team on the coronavirus pandemic, said Sunday that the U.S. needs to “call an audible” with its vaccination program, prioritizing a rush to give a single dose to as many people as possible ahead of a likely surge of cases attributed to more contagious mutations of the virus.

Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told “Meet the Press” that he expects to see a new surge of infections “in the next six to 14 weeks,” thanks to the spread of new variants like the one first discovered in the United Kingdom. Looking at an increase in hospitalizations in the U.K. during the spread of this new variant, he predicted another surge in the U.S. will usher in “something like we have not seen yet in this country.”

“We still want to get two doses in everyone, but I think right now, in advance of this surge, we need to get as many one-doses in as many people over 65 as we possibly can, to reduce serious illness and death that is going to occur over the weeks ahead,” Osterholm said.

Right now, the two coronavirus vaccines approved for emergency use require two doses spaced out over a few weeks, but studies do show the vaccines provide significant protection after just one dose. A vaccine candidate from Johnson & Johnson, which could be authorized in the coming weeks, requires just one dose.

Olsterholm compared the current situation to tracking a hurricane.

“The hurricane is coming. Because of this surge, we have to call an audible,” he said.

“If we get a number of first doses in people, particularly 65-years-of-age and older, we can really do a lot to reduce the number of serious illnesses and deaths in this next big surge, which is coming.”

The number of daily coronavirus cases has dropped in recent days. After eclipsing 200,000 new cases in 15 of 16 days in early January, the U.S. has reported under 200,000 new cases each day since Jan. 18, according to an NBC News analysis. But new, daily deaths have been near highs in recent days, eclipsing 3,600 in four of the last five days.

Health care workers in America have administered over 30 million vaccinations so far, according to NBC News' vaccination tracker.

President Joe Biden, even before his inauguration, announced a goal to vaccinate 100 million people in 100 days. But America hit that pace in the final days of the Trump administration, and last week, Biden said he believes America can soon administer 1.5 million vaccinations each day, a pace that Bloomberg reports has been met three times in the past week.

Even so, the vaccine rollout has at times been chaotic, with states reporting shortages and many Americans expressing frustration with the availability in their communities. Public health officials are hopeful that new vaccines, like the one being developed by Johnson & Johnson, along with more production of currently available shots, could help speed up the distribution process.",MSNBC,"['focus', 'johnson', 'administration', 'coronavirus', 'doses', 'biden', 'needs', 'days', 'cases', 'weeks', 'vaccines', 'surge', 'million', 'vaccine', 'epidemiologist', 'number']",0
2021-01-31 16:03:03+00:00,86,"BUNKER HILL, W.Va. — Since December, Ken Reed and his wife Tally, the owners of a small chain of pharmacies in the eastern part of this state, have been waking at dawn to travel to rural counties to vaccinate as many long-term care residents as possible.

The Reeds say their familiarity with the people in counties like Jefferson, Berkeley, Morgan, and Pendleton makes all the difference in gaining their trust.

“These are your neighbors, your friends, your friend's parents, and you just treat them like you'd want to be treated,” Ken Reed said.

West Virginia, a small and mostly rural state with a large elderly population, was tagged early on as a place likely to struggle with Covid-19 and any vaccine rollout.

But the state is now being hailed as a vaccination success story, with 85 percent of its delivered doses already used, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting it second in the country behind North Dakota as of last week.

A key part of the strategy, health officials say, was the decision not to activate a federal partnership with the CVS and Walgreens pharmacy chains and instead rely on independent drugstores like those owned by the Reeds.

Ken and Tally Reed go through paperwork and vaccine data at their kitchen table. NBC News

“We are a scrappy state that's resilient,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia's coronavirus czar and vice president and executive dean of health services at West Virginia University.

“But we absolutely rely on the creativity and the innovation of all of our people. Because we don't want to rely on external resource requirements for us to be able to do what we need to do.”

West Virginia's early success is all the more striking given that a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2020 ranked it as the state with the greatest share of adults at risk of serious illness if infected with Covid.

In an Appalachian state known for country roads, mountains and a dying coal industry, the population has long suffered from high rates of co-morbidities, including smoking and chronic conditions that drive its low overall health ranking.

But the state's unique characteristics have in many ways aided its Covid-19 response.

The relatively small and homogenous population has contributed to its success, said Dr. Gabor Kelen, director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. And the state actually outperforms the nation in some aspects of health care, including access to primary care physicians and percentage of insured patients. Only 6 percent are uninsured, compared to 9 percent nationally, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics.

“Access to primary care physicians for the population at least allows people to have trust … in the public health system,” said Kelen.

Much of that population lives more than a 45-minute drive from any outlet of the pharmacy chains that dominate most other states. Health officials say that leaves local independent pharmacists, like the Reeds, best situated to provide operational and medical expertise.

Ken Reed said there was no red tape involved in joining the state's vaccination effort when he got a call from a health official.

“Because we're the boss,” he said, as he and wife Tally laughed. “There is no middle management. … She asked if we could do it, and there was no decision-making chain. She hit the top of the decision-making chain.”

West Virginia was actually ahead of much of the nation in its Covid-19 response from the start of the pandemic, due to careful planning and its closeknit, small-town culture. A serendipitous encounter at a football game gave the state an edge in Covid-19 testing last spring, they said.

Two months before the White House required testing of all nursing home residents in mid-May, West Virginia was already negotiating with an executive of Labcorp, a national chain of blood and medical test sites.

Dr. Marsh, the state Covid-19 czar, had met the executive, a West Virginia University graduate, at a college football game in Morgantown. Marsh got in touch and the two men were soon hatching a plan for state-wide testing, which they rolled out on March 5. Their public-private partnership tested all 28,000 of West Virginia's nursing home residents in just two weeks.

The state also created a “team of teams,"" leveraging the National Guard early on to come up with and run an operations command center that focused on inter-agency communications and work with the Department of Health and Human Resources, the governor's office, and the state's health officers.

The National Guard has been involved with the state's response since November, running distribution from the state's five hubs. That includes logistical support for the receipt and transport of vaccines, helping to repackage vials and appropriate refrigerated containers to sites where stability can be maintained.

Through a partnership with another company, Everbridge, the consortium has now created a pre-registry system so that each person can be assigned a place in line and notified when and where they can be vaccinated. In the first four days after launching the system, Marsh says over 100,000 people signed up.

After initially experimenting with first come, first served clinics unsuccessfully, he says it was trial and error that led his team to the registry platform. Without the ability to predict the precise dose allotments it will receive each week, it was a challenge to meet demand, something the pre-registry system is now intended to address.

According to the CDC, as of Saturday West Virginia had given out more second doses per capita than any other state, with more than 3 percent of the population fully vaccinated.

Or, as Ken Reed puts it, “We crushed it.”

The Reeds spend their nights and early mornings plowing through the paperwork on their kitchen table and inputting data so the state can track the doses it has administered. Ken says he's also taken to dispelling misinformation about the vaccine — what he calls “garbage"" — on social media.

In line with the state's progress, the Reeds finished administering their share of second doses at long-term care centers last week and are set to take up work at schools.

“There's nothing like being able to help your neighbor,” said Tally.

As case rates have started to decline across the country, and are down about 35 percent in West Virginia as of last week, according to CDC data, Marsh points to the vaccine rollout.

“We've seen a great diminution of the rate of transmission, hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, ventilator use … I'm ascribing that to the vaccine,"" Marsh said, adding that it's too early to take a victory lap.

Supply remains the critical issue. Marsh's team says it's currently positioned to vaccinate as many as 23,600 people each week and has the ability to scale up to 100,000, but not the necessary supply of vaccines.

“We need more,” he said. While allotment is currently based on population, conversations with the federal government have led to the promise of additional doses of the Moderna vaccine. “We are very optimistic. But right now the supply chain doesn't seem to be able to fulfill the opportunity.”

West Virginia's remotest rural communities also remain a challenge. About 40 percent of residents don't have access to broadband internet, in part because of topography that makes connectivity a challenge.

To address that, Marsh's team is creating mobile vaccination vans and engaging with local health departments and faith-based organizations with a special focus on vulnerable groups and communities of color.

“When it comes to an opportunity to come together, to help each other, to lift each other, that's what West Virginia does best,” Marsh said. “And we're seeing that now.”

For a native West Virginian like Marsh, success in the face of so much adversity has also meant burnishing the image of his state.

“Right now we're changing the narrative externally,” he said. “And we're not doing it to do that. But that's a really, really great side effect.”

2021-01-31 04:02:05+00:00,68,"A single shot of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine is effective at keeping people out of the hospital and dying from the illness, the company reported Friday.

Johnson & Johnson, which made the vaccine in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is poised to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization as early as next week. If ultimately authorized, it would be the third Covid-19 vaccine available in the U.S., along with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Johnson & Johnson's phase 3 trial results found that in the U.S., the vaccine was 72 percent effective in preventing moderate to severe disease. Moderate illness included symptoms such as low oxygen levels, shortness of breath or deep vein thrombosis, while more severe outcomes include hospitalization and death.

When researchers looked just at the shot's effect on severe disease, it was shown to be 85 percent effective.

This interim analysis focused on 468 cases of symptomatic Covid-19, though the overall research included more than 44,000 participants in the U.S., South Africa, and several Latin American countries.

Efficacy for both moderate and severe illness varied widely by region. While the U.S. data showed 72 percent effectiveness, that percentage fell to 66 percent globally. And in South Africa, where a worrisome variant is the predominant strain, the effectiveness fell to 57 percent.

Still, ""not a single person who got vaccinated, and had illness after four weeks, ended up in the hospital,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of pharmaceutical research and development at Johnson & Johnson, told NBC News. This ""leads me to believe that this vaccine will stop this pandemic.""

In other words, adding the Johnson & Johnson product to the vaccine toolbox may serve to transform Covid-19 into more of an outpatient illness.

""We have a vaccine that does this critical function of really keeping people out of the hospital,"" said Dr. Matt Hepburn, Operation Warp Speed's Covid-19 response vaccine lead, during a call with reporters Friday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.

""The most important thing,"" Fauci said on the media call, ""is to keep people out of the hospital and prevent them from getting severe illness.""

""If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress,"" on the health care system, Fauci said.

No major side effects from the vaccine were reported, including severe allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, Mammen said.

""What this study showed was superb efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization and death,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota. Poland was not involved in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trials.

Still, the vaccine's lower efficacy against the South Africa variant, known as B.1.351, is concerning. The strain appears to pose more of a threat to current Covid-19 vaccines than other variants, such as the U.K. variant.

However, Mammen said during the Friday briefing that 28 days after receiving the Janssen shot, no participants in South Africa were hospitalized and none who had been vaccinated died.

""That to us is one of the most exciting results in the test today,"" Mammen said.

Those results could be significant for the U.S., as well. The first cases of the South African variant were reported in South Carolina Thursday. On Friday, the director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told TODAY that the B.1.351 variant — which is thought to be more contagious but doesn’t cause more severe illness — has likely already reached the point of community spread in the U.S.

Moderna said this week that its vaccine appears to be less effective against the South Africa variant, and a Pfizer study also suggested a less robust response. Thursday, biotech company Novavax said that early results from its trials in South Africa also showed a lower effectiveness against the strain.

""With one of the more worrisome variants on the planet, we were still able to show that more often than not, we were able to prevent moderate to severe infection,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease expert, as well as a principal investigator of one of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine trials at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

People with underlying health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure are at higher risk for severe Covid-19 complications.

""To be able to take that high risk group, and be able to see that none of them ended up in the hospital if they got Covid — that's impressive,"" Creech said.

Overall, Johnson & Johnson’s results are not as strong as those from Pfizer and Moderna, which each had exceptionally high levels of efficacy. Those vaccines have been shown to be about 95 percent effective against symptomatic Covid-19, when given in two shots about a month apart.

""Anytime we know we're going to see results from our clinical trials, we hold our breath,"" Creech said. ""If you were to tell me nine months ago that we were going to have a vaccine with over 60 percent efficacy, I would have thought, goodness, that's better than influenza most years."" Indeed, the flu shot that was administered during the 2019-2020 flu season turned out to be just 45 percent effective.

Unlike Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines — which require two doses about a month apart — the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be administered fully in one dose and only requires basic refrigeration for storage. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both work using messenger RNA, or mRNA, to teach the immune system how to recognize and fight off the coronavirus. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine uses a different approach, transporting these instructions into the body using an inactivated adenovirus, a type of virus that causes the common cold.

Two questions remain unanswered: Can the shot stop transmission of Covid-19 from person to person? And would adding a booster further boost overall efficacy?

Research into both of those questions is ongoing at Johnson & Johnson. The company said it should be able to provide data on transmission in the coming months.

The FDA could act on an emergency use authorization by the end of February. Johnson & Johnson expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June.

2021-01-31 02:17:06+00:00,63,"LOS ANGELES — Anti-vaccine protesters briefly forced officials to close the Covid-19 vaccination site at Dodger Stadium on Saturday as hundreds of people waited in their cars to receive doses, Los Angeles Fire Department officials said.

The fire department closed the stadium entrance for about an hour in the afternoon while protesters attempted to enter the parking lot, where vaccinations were being administered.

No one was arrested, but the Los Angeles Police Department deployed ""a sufficient amount of officers"" to the stadium, a spokesperson said. L.A. police also said that all vaccines would be administered despite the delay.

California ""is working around the clock to provide life-saving vaccines to those on the frontlines of this pandemic,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement posted to Twitter. ""We will not be deterred or threatened.""

Several of the demonstrators were seen not wearing masks and carrying signs suggesting the coronavirus pandemic is a ""scam,"" according to social media posts.

The anti-vaccine protest coincided with Los Angeles County public health officials detecting a second case of the coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, which was first found in the United Kingdom. The new strain is thought to be more contagious than the original coronavirus, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate that it will become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March.

More than 1.1 million Covid-19 cases and 16,647 deaths have been confirmed across Los Angeles County as of Saturday, according to the public health department.

2021-01-31 00:03:09+00:00,104,"Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine appeared to lose only a small bit of effectiveness against an engineered virus with three key mutations from the new coronavirus variant found in South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker.

The study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showed a less than two-fold reduction in antibody titer levels, indicating the vaccine would likely be effective in neutralizing a virus with the so-called E484K and N501Y mutations found in the South African variant.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had received the vaccine. Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in the new South African variant.

While these findings don’t indicate the need for a new vaccine to address the emerging variants, Pfizer and BioNTech are prepared to respond if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 shows evidence of escaping immunity by the Covid-19 vaccine, the companies said.

The scientists are currently engineering a virus with the full set of mutations and expect to have results from that in around two weeks, according to Pei-Yong Shi, an author of the study and a professor at UTMB.

The results are more encouraging than another non-peer-reviewed study from scientists at Columbia University earlier on Wednesday, which used a slightly different method and showed antibodies generated by the shots were significantly less effective against the South Africa variant.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

One possible reason for the difference could be that the Pfizer findings are based on an engineered coronavirus, and the Columbia study used a pseudovirus based on the vesicular stomatitis virus, a different type of virus, UTMB’s Shi said. He said he believes that finding in pseudoviruses should be validated using the real virus.

The study also showed even better results against several key mutations from the highly transmissible U.K. variant of the virus. Shi said they were also working on an engineered virus with the full set of mutations from that variant as well.

2021-01-30 13:32:05+00:00,83,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top immunologist, said Friday a third coronavirus vaccine will add a necessary tool to the nation's arsenal against the pandemic, despite its lower rate of effectiveness in research trials.

The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases spoke about the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, expected to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization as early as next week, during an interview on ""Nightly News with Lester Holt"" Friday.

""The protection against severe disease is very high,"" he said.

The vaccine has a 72 percent effective rate in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, Johnson & Johnson said earlier in the day. That compares to 95 percent for the Pfizer vaccine and 94 percent for Moderna's version.

The J&J vaccine doesn't require the unusually cold storage needed by the others and needs only basic refrigeration, the company said. The other two also require a second shot.

""From a practical standpoint,"" Fauci said, "" … to keep people out of the hospital and prevent death—this is value added.""

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA to teach the immune system how to fight off the coronavirus. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine uses an inactivated adenovirus, a type of virus that causes the common cold, to do so.

Fauci isn't reading a lot into the lower effective rate. In an earlier interview with the New York Press Club he said, ""Seventy-two percent efficacious would have been, 'Wow'"" if the J&J vaccine was presented to the world before the others.

In fact, he said on ""Nightly News with Lester Holt,"" the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which he said produced no hospitalizations during trials, has its advantages.

""You can just keep it in a refrigerator,"" he said. ""It's relatively cheap. And the company can make billions of doses.""

He said the addition of a third vaccine to the American arsenal can't come soon enough, as inoculation will be the nation's most effective weapon against mutations, including the U.K.-affiliated B.1.1.7 version and a South African variant.

The J&J vaccine, however, was found to be only 57 percent affective agains the latter. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can be modified to attack new variants, Fauci said.

Until the pandemic is under control, the virus will continue to mutate in an attempt to survive and thrive, Fauci said. A majority of Americans need to be vaccinated for normal life to return by fall, he said.

About 12 sailors aboard the USS Chafee have tested positive for Covid-19 About a dozen sailors aboard the USS Chafee have tested positive for Covid-19 and have been removed from the ship, the Navy confirmed Friday. “Individuals who were in close contact with those sailors are also off the ship and are in quarantine while they monitor for any symptoms,” Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Third Fleet spokesperson, said in a statement. Robertson said the warship, which is docked in San Diego, “remains able to meet its mission.” “No Chafee sailors have been hospitalized,” the commander said. Robertson’s statement came on the heels of a Navy Times report that 41 sailors out of a crew of 350 had either tested positive or had “been in close contact with infected shipmates,” including several of the ship’s cooks. And because of equipment shortages, some sailors on trip over from Hawaii have had to “wear dirty N95 mask for five days,” Navy Times reported. Share this -

Washington hospital apologizes after offering donors vaccine signup A hospital in Washington apologized after offering 100 donors an invitation to register for a Covid-19 vaccination appointment. Last Friday, the Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue said in an email to benefactors that the hospital was “pleased to share that we have 500 new open appointments in the Overlake COVID-19 vaccine clinic,” The Seattle Times first reported. The facility provided donors with an access code to register for appointments “by invite” only, according to the newspaper. Hospital officials told NBC News in a statement Friday that it did not exclusively offer the vaccine signup to the 100 donors. The hospital also extended an invite to 4,000 other community members, which included board members, volunteers, retired medical personnel, and current employees, the hospital said. All who registered had to be eligible under the state’s Covid-19 vaccine policy, according to the hospital. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

Fauci says kids could start getting vaccine by late spring Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top epidemiologist, said Friday the Biden Administration hopes to start administering Covid-19 vaccines to children by late spring. “We’ve already started on age de-escalation testing,” Fauci said during the White House Covid Response Team briefing. That appears to be a slightly faster time table than Dr. Jose Romero, who chairs the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Committee for Immunization Practices, forecast last month. Romero said he hoped to see trials testing Covid-19 vaccines in young children starting in the second quarter of this year and that, if the they were proven to be safe and effective, kids under the age of 18 would start getting their shots after that.

New Zealand Covid quarantine flaw exposed by tryst WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The woman who took a flight back to New Zealand was supposed to avoid all physical contact with others for 14 days as she went into mandatory quarantine. The man working at the quarantine hotel was supposed to be the last line of defense. But the two started passing notes to each other, including one written on the back of a face mask. Then she ordered a bottle of wine, which he delivered to her room. When he didn't return 20 minutes later, a security manager sent to investigate found the pair together in what authorities are describing as an inappropriate encounter, one in which physical distancing wasn't maintained. The incident earlier this month, which came to light Friday, has highlighted a very human weak point in New Zealand's coronavirus elimination procedures, in a country which has stamped out community spread of the virus. It is similar to lapses in Australia that may have contributed to a major outbreak last year in Melbourne. Read the full story here. Share this -

Brits are watching TV and gaming more in their third national lockdown People in the U.K. are spending more time streaming movies and gaming, exercising less and are more unhappy in Britain's current lockdown compared to the first one back in the spring, according to a large social study. The University of College London found that the most prevalent activity in January's lockdown has been watching TV, streaming content and playing video games. Other popular activities included communicating with friends and family digitally, following Covid-19 related news and listening to music. In comparison to the U.K.'s first lockdown in March, two-fifths of people are doing less exercise and a third of respondents said they were working more and devoting less time to hobbies and volunteering. More than 70,000 people have been questioned weekly over the past 44 weeks as the U.K. claimed the world's highest death toll per capita. Scientists suggest people have found this period tougher and are more focused on coping with their lives. The pandemic continues to affect mental health, with depression and anxiety levels reported at the highest they've been since June. Despite eroding positivity among respondents, the study found compliance to the U.K.'s current lockdown has improved to 97 percent. Share this -

European regulator says no new vaccine side effects detected AMSTERDAM — The European Medicines Agency says no new side effects linked to the coronavirus vaccine made by BioNTech and Pfizer were identified in the regulator’s first safety update on Covid-19 vaccines. In a statement published Friday, the European regulator said its expert committee assessed reports of people who died after getting the vaccine and said their review “did not suggest a safety concern.” Earlier this month, Norwegian officials amended their vaccination advice to say that doctors should assess frail and severely ill elderly people to decide if they should be immunized. The EMA concluded that safety data collected on the Pfizer vaccine are “consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine” and noted that severe allergic reactions are a known, rare side effect. It said the frequency of such allergic reactions was about 11 cases per million doses in the U.S. but that there was no comparable European estimate yet. Share this -

The most ambitious public health undertaking in recent history is sputtering.

But when? We're at yet another crossroad in American history as the pendulum swings from the tumultuous Trump era to the Biden-Harris administration, and this country can't afford to fail.

It's clear that the inequities crystallized by the Covid-19 crisis demand seismic change. And yet, with the coronavirus pandemic still raging — the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has projected 500,000 American deaths by mid-February — the most ambitious public health undertaking in recent history is sputtering.

Covid-19 vaccine distribution from state to state was uneven during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's administration recently released a new national Covid-19 strategy, but there's another barrier: When it comes to the willingness to be vaccinated, people are still catching up.

Recent polls show some cause for hope as far as Americans' willingness to get vaccinated. In December, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 71 percent of Americans said they would definitely or probably get vaccinated if a vaccine were available, which was a rise from 63 percent in September.

But the survey also showed that Black people, workers who identified themselves as essential and those who worked in health care settings answered that ""they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated"" at comparable rates, 35 percent, 33 percent and 29 percent. (Of note, this survey was completed just before Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines got emergency approval and nearly 17.3 million people in the U.S. were administered doses as of this week.)

That skepticism is at least in part reflected in the data from states that have released vaccination breakdowns by race and ethnicity, in which we can see Black people are on the lower end of the participation scale. The gap is for a host of reasons, not least of which is the epic levels of broken trust between Black communities and the health care system and clinical research more broadly.

A more massive public reckoning is needed if we are to beat back the pandemic.

But this isn't an excuse for health care and public institutions not to transform. It's an opportunity to demonstrate accountability and trustworthiness if trust is ever to be gained. These daunting truths are rooted in historical injustices and present-day disparities.

Still, the full-court press by the country's Black and brown physicians, public health officials and community leaders has yielded some progress. This improvement is due in part to the open and honest dialogue around issues related to medical apartheid and education to dispel the misinformation and lies peddled throughout the pandemic. But dialogue can be patronizing if words don't give way to credible action to solve pressing health inequities. It's the legacy of not just our current pandemic, but one that's centuries old.

Though the medical community hasn't solved the trustworthiness equation, we are beginning to speak with more social and cultural fluency, therefore registering more in historically excluded communities. The Biden-Harris plan to tackle this crisis, for example, hits many of the right notes and represents a much-needed departure from the inertia and reckless apathy of the previous administration.

I and many others in the field have welcomed these strategies. But I'll remain vigilant. We need to achieve equity with a vigor and pace adequate to protect the most vulnerable. We need to speed the distribution and administration of vaccines in those neighborhoods and communities that the pandemic has devastated the most.

A more massive public reckoning is needed if we are to beat back the pandemic. The federal government, in partnership with state and local communities, must deploy neighborhood resources, block by block, to engage, inform and encourage residents. We must build up health literacy.

We need to decode the process and the science behind the vaccine.

The goal here is not to convince. The goal is to catalyze understanding in plainspoken terms. We need to decode the process and the science behind the vaccine. We need to explain how the arrival of the current vaccines, though miraculous, wasn't purely magical; it demonstrates what happens when scientific breakthroughs across decades culminate and the federal government invests smartly and wisely in the public good. Those conversations also need to include what people should expect from the Biden presidency and how it will drive equity and urgency in this process and beyond.

Coronavirus relief must be a twin priority alongside coronavirus vaccination. People need to know how the administration will tackle other upstream issues, like food insecurity, access to safe and thriving communities, equitable opportunities in education and jobs, and high-quality, affordable housing — all the factors that made outcomes associated with Covid-19 worse for certain groups. All of this is part of the ecosystem upon which public trust, and thus public health, is nurtured or eroded.

The decision to vaccinate must be presented as the balance of scales between the risks of exposure, infection, hospitalization, lingering morbidity and death versus the comparatively lesser risks of adverse outcomes associated with vaccination. It must be said clearly what is known about routine side effects and what remains to be answered, like how long immunity lasts.

And in Black and brown groups where the burden of Covid-19 has been shouldered disproportionately, the conversation must not veer toward public shaming.

We must seize on the same intention of the heroic and outsize roles Black voters and social justice movements by people of color have played in rescuing the American republic and giving the country a double-fisted chance to rise from the ashes of the Capitol riots and the wholesale devastation caused by the pandemic.

By invoking our collective power, we will be crucial to forging a road map and tying our destinies to one another. This is true whether you're talking about universal masking or mass vaccinations. This will require patience and some pain but urgency and moral courage, nonetheless.

It's easy to feel powerless in the face of this health crisis. I recognized my power in volunteering for a coronavirus vaccine trial and in the public health advocacy I do daily. Our power is not only in demanding answers to our questions and fears, but also in demanding access to the tools to save our families and neighborhoods, to being partners in finding a solution and to everyone's respecting and valuing our humanity.

Then, and only then, can America call itself a resilient nation. Only then can the change that Sam Cooke prophesied in his legendary anthem finally come.

The pendulum is in motion. But the forward momentum we hope and pray for can easily swing back again. Now is a time when racial equity and health justice call for dismantling the pendulum altogether. In its place, the U.S. needs to erect new axes of power and enduring fairness. We cannot afford to miss out on that change.",MSNBC,"['communities', 'power', 'administration', 'brown', 'health', 'problem', 'black', 'pandemic', 'vaccinated', 'vaccine', 'skepticism', 'public', 'need', 'covid']",0

2021-01-29 13:05:07+00:00,105,"A single shot of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine is effective at keeping people out of the hospital and dying from the illness, the company reported Friday.

Johnson & Johnson, which made the vaccine in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is poised to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization as early as next week. If ultimately authorized, it would be the third Covid-19 vaccine available in the U.S., along with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Johnson & Johnson's phase 3 trial results found that in the U.S., the vaccine was 72 percent effective in preventing moderate to severe disease. Moderate illness included symptoms such as low oxygen levels, shortness of breath or deep vein thrombosis, while more severe outcomes include hospitalization and death.

When researchers looked just at the shot's effect on severe disease, it was shown to be 85 percent effective.

This interim analysis focused on 468 cases of symptomatic Covid-19, though the overall research included more than 44,000 participants in the U.S., South Africa, and several Latin American countries.

Efficacy for both moderate and severe illness varied widely by region. While the U.S. data showed 72 percent effectiveness, that percentage fell to 66 percent globally. And in South Africa, where a worrisome variant is the predominant strain, the effectiveness fell to 57 percent.

Still, ""not a single person who got vaccinated, and had illness after four weeks, ended up in the hospital,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of pharmaceutical research and development at Johnson & Johnson, told NBC News. This ""leads me to believe that this vaccine will stop this pandemic.""

In other words, adding the Johnson & Johnson product to the vaccine toolbox may serve to transform Covid-19 into more of an outpatient illness.

""We have a vaccine that does this critical function of really keeping people out of the hospital,"" said Dr. Matt Hepburn, Operation Warp Speed's Covid-19 response vaccine lead, during a call with reporters Friday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.

""The most important thing,"" Fauci said on the media call, ""is to keep people out of the hospital and prevent them from getting severe illness.""

""If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress,"" on the health care system, Fauci said.

No major side effects from the vaccine were reported, including severe allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, Mammen said.

""What this study showed was superb efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization and death,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota. Poland was not involved in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trials.

Still, the vaccine's lower efficacy against the South Africa variant, known as B.1.351, is concerning. The strain appears to pose more of a threat to current Covid-19 vaccines than other variants, such as the U.K. variant.

However, Mammen said during the Friday briefing that 28 days after receiving the Janssen shot, no participants in South Africa were hospitalized and none who had been vaccinated died.

""That to us is one of the most exciting results in the test today,"" Mammen said.

Those results could be significant for the U.S., as well. The first cases of the South African variant were reported in South Carolina Thursday. On Friday, the director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told TODAY that the B.1.351 variant — which is thought to be more contagious but doesn’t cause more severe illness — has likely already reached the point of community spread in the U.S.

Moderna said this week that its vaccine appears to be less effective against the South Africa variant, and a Pfizer study also suggested a less robust response. Thursday, biotech company Novavax said that early results from its trials in South Africa also showed a lower effectiveness against the strain.

""With one of the more worrisome variants on the planet, we were still able to show that more often than not, we were able to prevent moderate to severe infection,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease expert, as well as a principal investigator of one of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine trials at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

People with underlying health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure are at higher risk for severe Covid-19 complications.

""To be able to take that high risk group, and be able to see that none of them ended up in the hospital if they got Covid — that's impressive,"" Creech said.

Overall, Johnson & Johnson’s results are not as strong as those from Pfizer and Moderna, which each had exceptionally high levels of efficacy. Those vaccines have been shown to be about 95 percent effective against symptomatic Covid-19, when given in two shots about a month apart.

""Anytime we know we're going to see results from our clinical trials, we hold our breath,"" Creech said. ""If you were to tell me nine months ago that we were going to have a vaccine with over 60 percent efficacy, I would have thought, goodness, that's better than influenza most years."" Indeed, the flu shot that was administered during the 2019-2020 flu season turned out to be just 45 percent effective.

Unlike Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines — which require two doses about a month apart — the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be administered fully in one dose and only requires basic refrigeration for storage. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both work using messenger RNA, or mRNA, to teach the immune system how to recognize and fight off the coronavirus. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine uses a different approach, transporting these instructions into the body using an inactivated adenovirus, a type of virus that causes the common cold.

Two questions remain unanswered: Can the shot stop transmission of Covid-19 from person to person? And would adding a booster further boost overall efficacy?

Research into both of those questions is ongoing at Johnson & Johnson. The company said it should be able to provide data on transmission in the coming months.

The FDA could act on an emergency use authorization by the end of February. Johnson & Johnson expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June.

Russia snubs U.N. court hearings in case brought by Ukraine Ukraine pleaded with the United Nations' top court Monday to order Russia to halt its devastating invasion, saying Moscow is already committing widespread war crimes and “resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare” in its 12-day-old military onslaught. Russia snubbed the International Court of Justice hearings and its seats in the Great Hall of Justice remained empty. On a lawn outside the court's headquarters, the Peace Palace in The Hague, a protester placed colored candles spelling out the words: “Putin Come out.” Ukrainian representative Anton Korynevych told judges at the International Court of Justice: “Russia must be stopped and the court has a role to play in stopping it.” Ukraine has asked the court to order Russia to “immediately suspend the military operations” launched Feb. 24 “that have as their stated purpose and objective the prevention and punishment of a claimed genocide” in the separatist eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. A decision on Ukraine’s request is expected within days. Share this -

Arizona reports first cases of U.K. variant Arizona on Friday joined 30 other states that have detected a Covid-19 variant first seen in the United Kingdom and which is believed to be more transmissible. The Arizona Department of Health Services said the variant, B.1.1.7, has been confirmed in three test samples. It's the first detected cases in the state. That variant has been now found in 31 states, including Arizona, according to the state health department announcement and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is tracking detected cases on its website. There have been more than 400 cases of that variant reported in the nation. The U.K. variant is believed to be more transmissible. UK scientists earlier this month reported evidence that it could be associated with an increased risk of death, but more studies are needed to confirm if that is the case, the CDC says. Public health officials have stressed that there is much uncertainty around the conclusion it could be more deadly. Share this -

West Virginia governor claims nursing homes vaccination victory West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Friday the state is the nation's first to complete vaccinations at long-term care facilities, which had been an early source of Covid-19 outbreaks and deaths. He said 17,763 residents and 19,836 staff members at the state's nursing homes and assisted living facilities have received second doses of coronavirus vaccines. ""We’re already starting to see some positive impacts,” Justice said at a news conference. “We have cut the number of active outbreaks in nursing homes by 50 percent since the beginning of January."" The largely rural state has become a national leader in getting people inoculated, a crucial step in returning American life and commerce to normal. The state's elementary and middle schools were reopened Jan. 19. Justice said West Virginia teachers and school staffers 50 and older who have requested the vaccine have received at least a first of two shots.

Coachella 2021 canceled by health officials Health officials in California on Friday ordered the Coachella music festival and its sister event, the country music Stagecoach festival, canceled this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2021 event had not been canceled by its promoter, Goldenvoice, but the talent lineup was not announced despite a history of rolling out the roster around the first of year. The festivals also didn't take place last year because of the pandemic. ""This order is intended to reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19,"" the Riverside County health officer said in a public notice to organizers. ""If COVID-19 were detected at these festivals, the scope and number of attendees and the nature of the venue would make it infeasible, if not impossible, to track those who may be placed at risk."" The Coachella event, which started as an indie rock and dance music-showcase in 1999 but has morphed into a pop showcase, attracts more than 100,000 people to the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Share this -

About 12 sailors aboard the USS Chafee have tested positive for Covid-19 About a dozen sailors aboard the USS Chafee have tested positive for Covid-19 and have been removed from the ship, the Navy confirmed Friday. “Individuals who were in close contact with those sailors are also off the ship and are in quarantine while they monitor for any symptoms,” Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Third Fleet spokesperson, said in a statement. Robertson said the warship, which is docked in San Diego, “remains able to meet its mission.” “No Chafee sailors have been hospitalized,” the commander said. Robertson’s statement came on the heels of a Navy Times report that 41 sailors out of a crew of 350 had either tested positive or had “been in close contact with infected shipmates,” including several of the ship’s cooks. And because of equipment shortages, some sailors on trip over from Hawaii have had to “wear dirty N95 mask for five days,” Navy Times reported. Share this -

Washington hospital apologizes after offering donors vaccine signup A hospital in Washington apologized after offering 100 donors an invitation to register for a Covid-19 vaccination appointment. Last Friday, the Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue said in an email to benefactors that the hospital was “pleased to share that we have 500 new open appointments in the Overlake COVID-19 vaccine clinic,” The Seattle Times first reported. The facility provided donors with an access code to register for appointments “by invite” only, according to the newspaper. Hospital officials told NBC News in a statement Friday that it did not exclusively offer the vaccine signup to the 100 donors. The hospital also extended an invite to 4,000 other community members, which included board members, volunteers, retired medical personnel, and current employees, the hospital said. All who registered had to be eligible under the state’s Covid-19 vaccine policy, according to the hospital. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

New Zealand Covid quarantine flaw exposed by tryst WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The woman who took a flight back to New Zealand was supposed to avoid all physical contact with others for 14 days as she went into mandatory quarantine. The man working at the quarantine hotel was supposed to be the last line of defense. But the two started passing notes to each other, including one written on the back of a face mask. Then she ordered a bottle of wine, which he delivered to her room. When he didn't return 20 minutes later, a security manager sent to investigate found the pair together in what authorities are describing as an inappropriate encounter, one in which physical distancing wasn't maintained. The incident earlier this month, which came to light Friday, has highlighted a very human weak point in New Zealand's coronavirus elimination procedures, in a country which has stamped out community spread of the virus. It is similar to lapses in Australia that may have contributed to a major outbreak last year in Melbourne. Read the full story here. Share this -

Brits are watching TV and gaming more in their third national lockdown People in the U.K. are spending more time streaming movies and gaming, exercising less and are more unhappy in Britain's current lockdown compared to the first one back in the spring, according to a large social study. The University of College London found that the most prevalent activity in January's lockdown has been watching TV, streaming content and playing video games. Other popular activities included communicating with friends and family digitally, following Covid-19 related news and listening to music. In comparison to the U.K.'s first lockdown in March, two-fifths of people are doing less exercise and a third of respondents said they were working more and devoting less time to hobbies and volunteering. More than 70,000 people have been questioned weekly over the past 44 weeks as the U.K. claimed the world's highest death toll per capita. Scientists suggest people have found this period tougher and are more focused on coping with their lives. The pandemic continues to affect mental health, with depression and anxiety levels reported at the highest they've been since June. Despite eroding positivity among respondents, the study found compliance to the U.K.'s current lockdown has improved to 97 percent. Share this -

European regulator says no new vaccine side effects detected AMSTERDAM — The European Medicines Agency says no new side effects linked to the coronavirus vaccine made by BioNTech and Pfizer were identified in the regulator’s first safety update on Covid-19 vaccines. In a statement published Friday, the European regulator said its expert committee assessed reports of people who died after getting the vaccine and said their review “did not suggest a safety concern.” Earlier this month, Norwegian officials amended their vaccination advice to say that doctors should assess frail and severely ill elderly people to decide if they should be immunized. The EMA concluded that safety data collected on the Pfizer vaccine are “consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine” and noted that severe allergic reactions are a known, rare side effect. It said the frequency of such allergic reactions was about 11 cases per million doses in the U.S. but that there was no comparable European estimate yet. Share this -

Novavax, which received funding last year as part of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, is conducting vaccine trials in the United States, the U.K., Mexico and South Africa.

An interim analysis of the company's trial in the U.K., which included more than 15,000 participants ages 18 to 84, found that the vaccine was 95.6 percent effective against the virus and 85.6 percent effective against the more contagious U.K. variant.

The findings were based on 62 infections among trial participants, who received either a two-dose vaccination or a placebo. Six of the observed infections occurred in the group that got the vaccine.

In the Phase 2 South Africa trial, however, efficacy was 49.4 percent. The study was carried out on a much smaller group of 4,400 people, many of whom were HIV-positive. In trial participants who were HIV-negative, the vaccine was 60 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, Novavax said.

The most ambitious public health undertaking in recent history is sputtering.

But when? We're at yet another crossroad in American history as the pendulum swings from the tumultuous Trump era to the Biden-Harris administration, and this country can't afford to fail.

It's clear that the inequities crystallized by the Covid-19 crisis demand seismic change. And yet, with the coronavirus pandemic still raging — the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has projected 500,000 American deaths by mid-February — the most ambitious public health undertaking in recent history is sputtering.

Covid-19 vaccine distribution from state to state was uneven during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's administration recently released a new national Covid-19 strategy, but there's another barrier: When it comes to the willingness to be vaccinated, people are still catching up.

Recent polls show some cause for hope as far as Americans' willingness to get vaccinated. In December, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 71 percent of Americans said they would definitely or probably get vaccinated if a vaccine were available, which was a rise from 63 percent in September.

But the survey also showed that Black people, workers who identified themselves as essential and those who worked in health care settings answered that ""they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated"" at comparable rates, 35 percent, 33 percent and 29 percent. (Of note, this survey was completed just before Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines got emergency approval and nearly 17.3 million people in the U.S. were administered doses as of this week.)

That skepticism is at least in part reflected in the data from states that have released vaccination breakdowns by race and ethnicity, in which we can see Black people are on the lower end of the participation scale. The gap is for a host of reasons, not least of which is the epic levels of broken trust between Black communities and the health care system and clinical research more broadly.

A more massive public reckoning is needed if we are to beat back the pandemic.

But this isn't an excuse for health care and public institutions not to transform. It's an opportunity to demonstrate accountability and trustworthiness if trust is ever to be gained. These daunting truths are rooted in historical injustices and present-day disparities.

Still, the full-court press by the country's Black and brown physicians, public health officials and community leaders has yielded some progress. This improvement is due in part to the open and honest dialogue around issues related to medical apartheid and education to dispel the misinformation and lies peddled throughout the pandemic. But dialogue can be patronizing if words don't give way to credible action to solve pressing health inequities. It's the legacy of not just our current pandemic, but one that's centuries old.

Though the medical community hasn't solved the trustworthiness equation, we are beginning to speak with more social and cultural fluency, therefore registering more in historically excluded communities. The Biden-Harris plan to tackle this crisis, for example, hits many of the right notes and represents a much-needed departure from the inertia and reckless apathy of the previous administration.

I and many others in the field have welcomed these strategies. But I'll remain vigilant. We need to achieve equity with a vigor and pace adequate to protect the most vulnerable. We need to speed the distribution and administration of vaccines in those neighborhoods and communities that the pandemic has devastated the most.

A more massive public reckoning is needed if we are to beat back the pandemic. The federal government, in partnership with state and local communities, must deploy neighborhood resources, block by block, to engage, inform and encourage residents. We must build up health literacy.

We need to decode the process and the science behind the vaccine.

The most ambitious public health undertaking in recent history is sputtering.

But when? We're at yet another crossroad in American history as the pendulum swings from the tumultuous Trump era to the Biden-Harris administration, and this country can't afford to fail.

It's clear that the inequities crystallized by the Covid-19 crisis demand seismic change. And yet, with the coronavirus pandemic still raging — the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has projected 500,000 American deaths by mid-February — the most ambitious public health undertaking in recent history is sputtering.

Covid-19 vaccine distribution from state to state was uneven during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's administration recently released a new national Covid-19 strategy, but there's another barrier: When it comes to the willingness to be vaccinated, people are still catching up.

Recent polls show some cause for hope as far as Americans' willingness to get vaccinated. In December, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 71 percent of Americans said they would definitely or probably get vaccinated if a vaccine were available, which was a rise from 63 percent in September.

But the survey also showed that Black people, workers who identified themselves as essential and those who worked in health care settings answered that ""they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated"" at comparable rates, 35 percent, 33 percent and 29 percent. (Of note, this survey was completed just before Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines got emergency approval and nearly 17.3 million people in the U.S. were administered doses as of this week.)

That skepticism is at least in part reflected in the data from states that have released vaccination breakdowns by race and ethnicity, in which we can see Black people are on the lower end of the participation scale. The gap is for a host of reasons, not least of which is the epic levels of broken trust between Black communities and the health care system and clinical research more broadly.

A more massive public reckoning is needed if we are to beat back the pandemic.

But this isn't an excuse for health care and public institutions not to transform. It's an opportunity to demonstrate accountability and trustworthiness if trust is ever to be gained. These daunting truths are rooted in historical injustices and present-day disparities.

Still, the full-court press by the country's Black and brown physicians, public health officials and community leaders has yielded some progress. This improvement is due in part to the open and honest dialogue around issues related to medical apartheid and education to dispel the misinformation and lies peddled throughout the pandemic. But dialogue can be patronizing if words don't give way to credible action to solve pressing health inequities. It's the legacy of not just our current pandemic, but one that's centuries old.

Though the medical community hasn't solved the trustworthiness equation, we are beginning to speak with more social and cultural fluency, therefore registering more in historically excluded communities. The Biden-Harris plan to tackle this crisis, for example, hits many of the right notes and represents a much-needed departure from the inertia and reckless apathy of the previous administration.

I and many others in the field have welcomed these strategies. But I'll remain vigilant. We need to achieve equity with a vigor and pace adequate to protect the most vulnerable. We need to speed the distribution and administration of vaccines in those neighborhoods and communities that the pandemic has devastated the most.

A more massive public reckoning is needed if we are to beat back the pandemic. The federal government, in partnership with state and local communities, must deploy neighborhood resources, block by block, to engage, inform and encourage residents. We must build up health literacy.

More nursing home residents died from the coronavirus than the Health Department’s ""published nursing home data reflected and may have been undercounted by as much as 50 percent,” Attorney General Letitia James' investigators concluded in 76-page report.

“As the pandemic and our investigations continue, it is imperative that we understand why the residents of nursing homes in New York unnecessarily suffered at such an alarming rate,” James said in a statement.

New York leads the country in the number of Covid-19 deaths with 43,734, according to the latest NBC News tally, most of which occurred in the early days of the pandemic, when public health officials were trying figure out how the disease was spreading.

There was no immediate response from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat whose pandemic response has been widely praised but who has also been criticized for waiting until May to reverse a state policy that required long-term care facilities to accept recovering patients who may still test positive for Covid-19.

Cuomo has insisted that it was up to the nursing homes to alert state health officials if they were not equipped to take care of infected residents. And a report issued by the state in July laid the blame for the more than 8,500 deaths of seniors on staffers who unwittingly infected residents.

Dr. Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, insisted in a statement that there was no ""undercount.""

""The word 'undercount' implies there are more total fatalities than have been reported; this is factually wrong,"" Zucker said. ""The OAG's report is only referring to the count of people who were in nursing homes but transferred to hospitals and later died. The OAG suggests that all should be counted as nursing home deaths and not hospital deaths even though they died in hospitals.""

Cuomo's office said Thursday the state followed federal guidance when issuing its order on nursing homes.

Zucker added that ""the report's findings that nursing home operators failed to comply with the State's infection control protocols are consistent with DOH's own investigation.""

Asked at a previously scheduled news conference about the attorney general's report, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said, ""We have to get the full truth, and we have to make sure it never ever happens again, nothing like this happens again, and we have to be honest about the numbers.""

De Blasio and James are also Democrats.

State Rep. Elise Stefanik, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, joined other Republicans in calling for the resignations of Cuomo and Zucker.

""This is now more than a nursing home scandal, this is a massive corruption and coverup scandal at the highest level of New York State Government implicating the Governor, the Secretary to the Governor, the New York State Health Commissioner and the Governor’s staff,"" Stefanik said in a statement.

The attorney general’s office launched an investigation last spring after whistleblowers reported that residents who tested positive for Covid-19 were being “intermingled” with healthy residents and that the nursing homes were failing to adequately test workers for the coronavirus and making “sick employees continue to work and care for residents or face retaliation or termination.”

Soon, investigators began noticing discrepancies between the numbers of Covid-19 nursing home deaths they were seeing and the numbers being reported by the Health Department.

“Preliminary data obtained by O.A.G. suggests that many nursing home residents died from Covid-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which is not reflected in D.O.H.’s published total nursing home death data,” a summary of the report reads.

Investigators, in their survey of 62 nursing homes (about 10 percent of the total statewide), also noticed another pattern.

“The investigations also revealed that nursing homes’ lack of compliance with infection control protocols put residents at increased risk of harm, and facilities that had lower pre-pandemic staffing ratings had higher COVID-19 fatality rates,” the report states.

As a result of the report, the attorney general’s office said it will investigate more than 20 nursing homes whose conduct during the first wave of the pandemic “presented particular concern.”

The New York State Nurses Association did not weigh in on the alleged death toll undercounting in a statement issued Thursday, but it did applaud James for probing other issues, like the shortages of personal protection equipment that were rife early on in the pandemic.

""The report confirms what we have heard from members since the Spring of 2020: Many long-term care facilities lacked adequate PPE, basic infection control procedures, safe staffing, and quarantine protocols to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within facilities,"" the NYSNA said in a statement. ""A key finding of the report is that poor staffing increased mortality rates, adding to the large body of evidence that shows safe staffing saves lives.""",MSNBC,"['ny', 'york', 'nursing', 'covid19', 'deaths', 'toll', 'health', 'higher', 'residents', 'death', 'attorney', 'state', 'reported', 'homes', 'ag', 'covid', 'report']",0

The study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showed a less than two-fold reduction in antibody titer levels, indicating the vaccine would likely be effective in neutralizing a virus with the so-called E484K and N501Y mutations found in the South African variant.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had received the vaccine. Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in the new South African variant.

While these findings don’t indicate the need for a new vaccine to address the emerging variants, Pfizer and BioNTech are prepared to respond if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 shows evidence of escaping immunity by the Covid-19 vaccine, the companies said.

The scientists are currently engineering a virus with the full set of mutations and expect to have results from that in around two weeks, according to Pei-Yong Shi, an author of the study and a professor at UTMB.

The results are more encouraging than another non-peer-reviewed study from scientists at Columbia University earlier on Wednesday, which used a slightly different method and showed antibodies generated by the shots were significantly less effective against the South Africa variant.

One possible reason for the difference could be that the Pfizer findings are based on an engineered coronavirus, and the Columbia study used a pseudovirus based on the vesicular stomatitis virus, a different type of virus, UTMB’s Shi said. He said he believes that finding in pseudoviruses should be validated using the real virus.

The study also showed even better results against several key mutations from the highly transmissible U.K. variant of the virus. Shi said they were also working on an engineered virus with the full set of mutations from that variant as well.

WHO team in Wuhan visits hospital that treated early Covid-19 cases WUHAN, China — A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 on Friday visited a hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was one of the first to treat patients in the early days of the outbreak. After meeting with Chinese scientists earlier in the day, the team went to the Hebei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine. Zhang Jixian, director of the hospital's department of respiratory and critical care, has been cited by state media as the first to report the novel coronavirus, after treating an elderly couple in late 2019 whose CT scans showed differences from typical pneumonia.

Novavax says its vaccine 89.3 percent effective An experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by the biotech company Novavax is 89.3 percent effective at preventing Covid-19, the company announced Thursday. Results from Novavax's Phase 3 trial in the United Kingdom demonstrated the vaccine candidate's efficacy and showed that it protected against the U.K. variant of the virus. Results from another trial, in South Africa, showed that it was also effective against the variant that emerged there, although efficacy was lower. Stanley Erck, president and CEO of Novavax, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said the trial results show that the vaccine ""has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis.""

L.A. mayor vaccinated though he's not in priority group LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti made clear in December that he would wait his turn to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, echoing county policy that nursing home residents, people 65 and older and medical workers will be first in line. “I’m not jumping any queue,” he said. But the 49-year-old Democrat was quietly vaccinated last week at the recommendation of medical personnel, after spending several days assisting health care workers at a large coronavirus vaccination center at Dodger Stadium. His office said Wednesday he received the first dose of the vaccine Jan. 21, his fifth day working at the site where he was “interacting with hundreds of Angelenos each day.” Share this -

Over 1,000 Columbia students on tuition strike, demanding pandemic concessions More than 1,000 Columbia University students are withholding this semester's tuition as they demand that the Ivy League school in New York City lower its cost amid financial burdens and the move to online classes prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Students initiated the tuition strike last Friday, when payments for the semester were due. In a sweeping list of demands, students accused the school of demonstrating a ""flagrant disregard for initiatives democratically supported within the community."" The striking students are asking the school to lower tuition by at least 10 percent and to increase financial aid. The letter also asks the school to end its expansion into and gentrification of West Harlem, defund its university police force and bargain in good faith with campus unions. Read the full story.

Fauci backs CDC's recommendations on reopening schools Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that he supports re-opening schools amid the coronavirus pandemic under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines. “I would back the CDC recommendations because that is really based on data… we need to try and get the children back to school and that's the goal of President Biden that in the next one hundred days to get the K to eights back in school,” Fauci said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" The CDC said in a recent study that schools should bring back in-person learning as soon as possible if social distancing and masks are mandated. The research, published online in the journal JAMA, offered guidance for local officials, school administrators, and parents on how to open schools safely while limiting the spread of Covid-19.

California lawmakers vote to extend eviction moratorium as Covid continues to stifle economy California lawmakers voted to extend the state's eviction moratorium through June 30 as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic continues to create economic uncertainty for millions of renters. Under the proposed legislation, $2.6 billion in federal funds would be used as rental subsidies and would reimburse landlords 80 percent of unpaid back rent that occurred between April 2020 and March 2021 if the landlords agree to forgive the remaining 20 percent. Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously said he will sign the legislation. “These bills aren’t perfect and will not solve the problem in the long run, but we had to take action now to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from falling into homelessness in the next couple of months,"" said Assemblymember Richard Bloom, a Democrat who represents Santa Monica and surrounding communities.

Democrats prepare to go it alone on Covid relief if Republicans don't cooperate WASHINGTON — Democrats are discussing a path to bypass Republicans and approve an aggressive Covid-19 relief package on a party-line basis as prospects for bipartisan support for President Joe Biden's top priority diminish. White House economic adviser Brian Deese and Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zientz held a call Thursday with Senate Democrats as they grapple with whether to cut a slimmed-down deal or use a process known as reconciliation to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote rule to avoid a filibuster. ""The sentiment is this: We would like Republicans to work with us to be part of the solution to deliver emergency help, but we can’t wait, it’s urgent, and we need to double-track this process,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who was on the call, told reporters. “So we will continue to reach out to Republicans, but I’m a big supporter of having an insurance policy in place through reconciliation.” Click here to read the full story.

In Florida, with its large Brazilian community, worries over Covid variant MIAMI — Even though Teresa Frade was infected with Covid-19 over the summer and already got both doses of the vaccination, she is still apprehensive about visiting her family in Brazil. The last time she was there was in late February last year, and she returned just before Florida went into lockdown. Frade, 54, a health care worker in South Florida is not sure if she has can get reinfected with the Brazilian variant that has ravaged parts of the South American country and worries whether it can spread here. Florida leads the country with the highest number of cases caused by the more transmissible and possibly more deadly Covid-19 variant from the United Kingdom, but new concerns are emerging over the potential spread of the Brazilian variant, also more contagious.

Peru mourns its 'pandemic soldiers,' doctors who died treating Covid LIMA, Peru — Black-and-white pictures of dozens of men and women, some in their 30s and others much older, line the perimeter of a bright yellow building overlooking the Pacific, a two-story-tall black ribbon covering part of the facade and a Peruvian flag at a half-staff near the door. The makeshift memorial is for fallen “pandemic soldiers” — doctors who have died since the coronavirus struck this South American nation last year and unraveled the public health care system. “Our country, like the other countries in the world, is not prepared for this pandemic. Even more so, the most affected are developing countries like ours,” said Dr. Gerardo Campos, a spokesman for the Medical College of Peru. The college represents physicians and its headquarters is the site of the memorial, where a cleaning worker wearing a face mask recently dusted off each photo and placed flowers in front of them.

First U.S. cases of South African Covid-19 variant found in South Carolina South Carolina health officials announced on Thursday the detection of two cases associated with the Covid-19 variant discovered in South Africa — the first recorded cases of this variant in the United States. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control said experts agreed that existing vaccines would work against this variant. While this variant does appear to spread easier and quicker, the department said there was ""no evidence to suggest that the B.1.351 variant causes more severe illness."" The DHEC added that there was no known travel history or connection between the two adults who tested positive for the variant — one was from the Lowcountry region of South Carolina and the other from the Pee Dee region. Late Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified state health officials that one sample contained the Covid-19 variant first found in South Africa, according to NBC affiliate WIS. The other case was discovered at the DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory, the station reported. The variant has been detected in 30 other countries, according to the station. The CDC said in a statement on Thursday that the agency would continue to monitor the Covid-19 variant and recommended that people avoid travel at this time. Dr. Brannon Traxler, DHEC's interim public health director, said in a statement that the variant was an ""important reminder to all South Carolinians that the fight against this deadly virus is far from over."" “While more COVID-19 vaccines are on the way, supplies are still limited. Every one of us must recommit to the fight by recognizing that we are all on the front lines now. We are all in this together,” she said. Share this -

Can the U.S. keep Covid variants in check? Here's what it takes. The Covid-19 variants that have emerged in the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and now Southern California are eliciting two notably distinct responses from U.S. public health officials. First, broad concern. A variant that wreaked havoc in the U.K., leading to a spike in case numbers and hospitalizations, is surfacing in more places in the U.S. This week, another worrisome variant seen in Brazil surfaced in Minnesota. If these or other strains significantly change the way the virus transmits and attacks the body, as scientists fear they might, they could cause yet another prolonged surge in illnesses and deaths in the U.S., even as case numbers have begun to plateau and vaccines are rolling out. On the other hand, variants aren't novel or even uncommon in viral illnesses. The viruses that trigger common colds and flus regularly evolve. Even if a mutated strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, makes it more contagious or makes people sicker, the basic public health response stays the same: monitor the virus and any mutations as they move across communities. Use masking, testing, physical distancing and quarantine to contain the spread. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

WHO team in Wuhan for Covid origins study leaves quarantine WUHAN, China — A World Health Organization team emerged from quarantine in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday, to begin field work in a fact-finding mission on the origins of the Covid-19 virus. The researchers, who were required to complete 14 days in quarantine after arriving in China, left their hotel and boarded a bus in the midafternoon. The mission has become politically charged as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. A major question is where the Chinese side will allow the researchers to go and whom they will be able to talk to. Yellow barriers blocked the entrance to the hotel, keeping the media at a distance. Before the researchers boarded, workers in full protective gear could be seen loading their luggage onto the bus. The driver wore a full-body white protective suit and the researchers wore masks.

U.S. is in a 'race against time' with new coronavirus variants, scientists warn The United States is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible before other potentially more worrisome variants of the coronavirus emerge, according to experts. Vaccination efforts in the U.S. have been hamstrung by delivery issues, insufficient supply and hesitancy to get the shots. But to avert another surge of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, scientists say it may be necessary to rethink how the vaccines are rolled out to ramp up the number of shots administered and to protect against new strains of the virus. ""We really are in a race against new variants,"" said Wan Yang, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. ""We need to prepare as much as possible before things increase to a level that puts more strain on our health care systems."" Click here to read the full story. Share this -

South Dakota has successful vaccination program but high infection rate South Dakota has one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the country, but it’s also got one of the most successful vaccination programs in the land. So far, health workers have been able to administer 82,823 doses, a rate of 9,362 per 100,000 people, that is seventh best in the country, according to the latest federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. And the reason it’s been so successful is because South Dakota already has a well-established vaccination program in place, said Victor Huber, a biomedical sciences professor at the University of South Dakota. “Since South Dakota has an excellent infrastructure in place for delivering vaccines, this is an example of our state benefitting from those efforts being applied to the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,” Huber said in an email to NBC News. “This is a good sign for our state moving forward.” South Dakota, which has a population of just 885,000, has a Covid-19 infection rate of 27.18 percent, which is the sixth worst in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University. The state has recorded 107,608 cases and 1,739 deaths due to Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to NBC News data. Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, has been harshly criticized for her hands-off approach to the pandemic by the public health establishment but remains popular with voters in the conservative state.

Miami Heat to welcome back fans with help of Covid-sniffing dogs The Miami Heat will have fans in the stands Thursday night for the first time in months with the help of some particularly fast and accurate Covid-19 detectors — virus-sniffing dogs. Ticket holders will be screened by Covid-19 detection dogs when they arrive at America Airlines Arena for the 8 p.m. game against the Los Angeles Clippers, officials said on the team's website. The dogs will walk past each fan upon arrival, according to a video posted to the site. If a dog sits down, the dog is indicating that it has detected the virus, and the person and their party will not be allowed in the arena. The Heat website specifies that the Covid-sniffing dogs have been specifically trained to identify the virus and won't sit down in the presence of someone who has simply been vaccinated.

Fauci: Covid-19 vaccine rollout must prioritize people of color The U.S. Covid-19 vaccine rollout must account for the virus' disproportionate impact on people of color, Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with the New England Journal of Medicine. ""I think that's the one thing we really got to be careful of,"" Fauci, who is the president's chief medical advisor as well as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. ""We don't want in the beginning that most of the people who are getting it are otherwise, well, middle-class white people."" Fauci's comments come amid a reported distrust in the medical community among racial minorities in the U.S. Triggered by a dark history of medical experimentation and less access to care, people in Black and Latino communities struggling with high Covid-19 rates are among those least likely to get vaccinated, according to health advocates. ""You absolutely have to respect the hesitancy of the minority population. They keep coming back and saying the history of Tuskegee,"" Fauci added, referring to the infamous 1932 experiment, in which the U.S. government denied African-American men treatment for syphilis and documented how the disease destroyed their bodies for nearly four decades in Alabama.

Peru sees second Covid wave, orders total lockdown of capital and 9 other regions LIMA, Peru - President Francisco Sagasti of Peru on Tuesday night announced a total lockdown of the capital and nine other regions following a significant increase in Covid-19 cases, which he said had pushed hospitals close to collapse. Sagasti said the new measures covering central Peru would remain in effect until at least Feb. 14. They include instructions to work from home, the closure of all nonessential shops, the suspension of interregional land and air travel, and the extension of a ban on flights coming from Europe to flights from Brazil in a bid to curb new, more contagious strains of the virus. On Tuesday, Peru reported 4,444 new cases of the coronavirus, taking its total to 1,107,239, and 40,107 deaths.

Biden to sit out Covid briefing as part of a new plan to talk to Americans WASHINGTON — When the Biden administration holds its first coronavirus briefing Wednesday, there will be no cameo from the president, no speakers behind the White House podium jousting with reporters, and no data coming from outside the federal agencies involved in the pandemic response. And in a sign of the awareness of the risks of putting people in a room together, the briefing won't even be held in person. It will be a different scene from the coronavirus news briefings of the Trump administration, which often became freewheeling televised spectacles with the president jockeying with journalists. It's one of the clearest signs yet of how President Joe Biden is taking a vastly different approach when it comes to talking to the American people. From the start of the pandemic, public health officials have been making the case that combating the virus requires a communal effort. Biden and his pandemic advisers argue that changing the way information gets to the public will be one of the primary ways to turn around the trajectory of the pandemic.

At-home Covid tests offer promises — and challenges Three new completely at-home Covid-19 tests are hitting the market soon, promising to deliver results within minutes. The BinaxNow, Lucira and Ellume tests all offer slight variations on a similar approach: swab, insert and get results without even leaving your kitchen table, in 30 minutes or less. The tests offer promising accessibility: No visits to a doctor or clinic, or scheduling a drive-through at a pharmacy. And, since patients don’t have to leave home, it's easier for them to take the test, decreasing the risk they might infect others. “If millions of Americans tested themselves at home twice a week we would start to see dramatic reductions in cases within a month or two,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

China administered more than 22M vaccine doses so far BEIJING — China has given more than 22 million coronavirus vaccine shots to date as it carries out a drive ahead of next month’s Lunar New Year holiday, health authorities said Wednesday. The effort, which began six weeks ago, targets key groups such as medical and transport workers and has accelerated vaccinations in China. About 1.6 million doses had been given over several months before the campaign began. “The carrying out of vaccination has been ongoing in a steady and orderly manner,” Zeng Yixin, vice chairman of the National Health Commission Said at a news conference. He said that 22.76 million doses had been administered as of Tuesday. It’s not clear how many people that represents since the vaccine is given in two doses, and some may have received their second shot. China, which largely stopped the spread of the virus last spring, has seen fresh outbreaks this winter in four northern provinces. About 1,800 new cases have been reported since mid-December, including two deaths. Authorities are strongly discouraging people from traveling during the Lunar New Year holiday, a time when Chinese traditionally return to their hometowns for family gatherings. Share this -

Poorer countries will lag 6 to 8 months behind richer nations in vaccine rollout Poorer countries face a best-case scenario of a 6 to 8 month lag behind richer nations in getting access to Covid-19 vaccines to protect their populations against the pandemic disease, the philanthropist Bill Gates said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters, Gates called the rollout of the first Covid-19 shots a ""super hard allocation problem"" that was putting pressure on global institutions, governments and drugmakers. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has so far committed some $1.75 billion to the global response to the pandemic, including via funds for the COVAX vaccine-sharing initiative co-led by the World Health Organization, and via direct support for some vaccine makers. It hopes to start some deliveries next month. ""The total number of doses that GAVI (and COVAX) will have in the first half of the year is still very modest,"" he said. ""Yes, they will get some doses out, but if you compare when they will reach the same percentage of coverage as the rich countries — that's where I'd say it's six to eight months, best case.""

2021-01-28 01:02:03+00:00,11,"CARACAS, Venezuela—Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro appears to be counting on yet another “miracle” to save his citizens from Covid-19, promoting a secretive solution with no published scientific evidence he claims will conquer the new coronavirus.

“Ten drops under the tongue every four hours and the miracle is done,” Maduro said in a televised appearance on Sunday. “It’s a powerful antiviral, very powerful, that neutralizes the coronavirus.”

But his government has released no evidence. He even kept secret the name of the “brilliant Venezuelan mind” behind it, saying he needed to protect them. Scientists at home and abroad remained skeptical. The local National Academy of Medicine said it appeared be derived from the common herb thyme.

It’s not the first time the Venezuelan leader has promoted a cure. In October, he notified the Pan American Health Organization that Venezuelan scientists discovered a molecule that nullifies the replication capacity of the new coronavirus. He hasn’t spoken of that development since. He’s also promoted a special herbal tea he claims can fend off the virus and other ailments.

Other leaders too have embraced solutions dismissed by scientific studies. Former U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro both stubbornly touted an antimalarial drug despite repeated studies finding it ineffective and possibly dangerous.

The new coronavirus hasn’t hit Venezuela as hard as other South American countries such as Brazil, Ecuador and Peru, though many experts say that’s likely because sanctions against Maduro’s government have sharply limited travel there.

Maduro said the treatment, which he called carvativir, has been under testing for nine months among Venezuelans ill with the coronavirus. He said he plans to distribute it nationwide and to other nations as well.

Dr. David Boulware, professor of medicine and an infectious diseases physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School, noted the lack of scientific evidence.

“This is, just as with other things, people trying to sell, you know, some magic beans as the solution to a complex problem,” Boulware told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “This would be great if it worked, but I would like to see the data.”

Venezuela’s National Academy of Medicine said “it’s prudent ... to wait for more data from the carvativir tests according to international protocols.”

Since October, Venezuela has been part of trials for the Sputnik V vaccine from Russia, a staunch ally of Maduro’s government. Venezuela signed a contract in December with Russia to buy the vaccine, but inoculations aren’t scheduled to start until April.

Rosa Colina, 58, said authorities should do more to get Venezuelans vaccinated sooner. She said colleagues at a local health center and some neighbors have died from Covid-19.

“I’m of the mind that we need the vaccine, not these droplets,” she said. “I think that won’t have any effect.”

2021-01-27 21:01:05+00:00,57,"WASHINGTON — The government is working to buy 200 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines, a move that could provide enough doses to fully inoculate nearly every American by the end of the summer, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.

The government is seeking 100 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million from Moderna, an order that would be made available over the summer. They would be in addition to the 400 million combined doses the companies had already committed to provide the U.S., Biden said. He said he expects to be able to confirm the purchase soon.

""It will be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans to beat the pandemic,"" Biden said.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The agreement would lessen the country's reliance on getting additional doses on the market from other manufacturers. The Trump administration had passed on buying more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna and was instead betting that additional vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca would come to market. Johnson & Johnson said it will release data for its single-dose vaccine in the coming days.

""We can't speak to the Trump administration, but what we can say is it is our philosophy, given the nature of this emergency and the speed with which the virus needs to be addressed, to procure enough supply as we need to vaccinate Americans and to give Americans the confidence we can do that,"" a senior administration official said.

In the near term, the supplies being shipped to states are set to increase by about 20 percent, to 10 million doses a week, for the next three weeks, the official said. The federal government will also begin letting states know how many doses they will be getting at least three weeks in advance — addressing complaints by governors that they aren't able to plan and schedule appointments.

The Biden administration has begun using the Defense Production Act to buy more of a special syringe that can extract more doses per vaccine vial, and it plans to use the wartime law for other raw materials, like lipid nanoparticles and bioreactor bags, if necessary, the official said.

But the supply chain for those relatively rare materials is ""somewhat fragile,"" and there is a risk of disrupting production of other health care products, the official said. The U.S. also has to compete with other countries for the same resources.

The official said the administration isn't holding back doses aside from a small emergency reserve, but states have been holding back the doses they receive at different levels to ensure that enough is available for people to get their second shots.

State and local officials have been complaining in recent weeks that while they can give more shots and that demand from the public is high, they lack the supply of vaccines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that as of Tuesday, 23.5 million doses were administered and that more than 3.4 million people were fully vaccinated. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday on MSNBC that the city has the capacity to administer 500,000 doses a week but that it hasn't been able to do so because it is waiting on more vaccine supplies from the federal government.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'johnson', 'administration', 'supply', 'states', 'doses', 'biden', 'orders', 'official', 'weeks', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'million', '200']",0

2021-01-27 17:01:06+00:00,361,"A Georgia state lawmaker said his refusal to take a Covid-19 test got him kicked out of the House chambers on Tuesday.

But Georgia House Speaker David Ralston said the lawmaker, Rep. David Clark, has repeatedly refused to follow House policy which states that all members and staff be tested for the coronavirus twice a week.

""The member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session,"" Ralston's office said in a statement on Twitter.

""The member refused to leave of his/her own accord. As such, under the authority granted to the Speaker by House Rules, the member was escorted out of the Chamber by a member of the Georgia Department of Public Safety.""

Clark, a Republican, said in an emailed statement Tuesday that he arrived at the chamber ready to follow the required protocols by wearing a mask, social distancing and having his temperature taken.

But ""what I will not do is be forced to have a Covid test, or any unnecessary medical test, done without a basis for doing so,"" he said.

""The seat that I hold for District 98 is not my seat, but the people’s seat. I work for you, and I cannot in good conscience watch expensive tests that should be given to Georgia citizens who desperately need them be wasted for nothing more than political optics at the Capitol.""

State Rep. David Clark, R-Buford, speaks during a press conference on April 17, 2019, in Atlanta. Bob Andres / Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP file

During an interview with a WXIA reporter, a maskless Clark said that when he walked into the chamber this morning, he was told he was not allowed to be in there. He said he doesn't agree with the twice-a-week testing policy because there are essential workers who are not able to get tested.

""I check my temperature when I come in. When I go in the chambers, I wear my mask. I follow the protocols they want in the chamber but two tests a week is wrong on my conscience when teachers can't get it and first responders can't get it,"" he told the reporter. ""We get two tests but nobody else gets the same thing out there. My grandma doesn't get two tests.""

In a December memo, Ralston said that all members and House staff are required to be tested for the coronavirus twice a week during the 2021 Session. Masks must be worn while on Capitol grounds and may only be taken off when a member is addressing the House.

Ralston said in his statement that Clark will be allowed to return to the chamber after he complies with the policy.

""This is about preventing the spread of a disease that has killed more than 12,000 Georgians,"" he said.

2021-01-27 16:02:04+00:00,23,"Contrary to some lies we've heard in the last year, we didn't suddenly stop talking about the coronavirus after Election Day. It hasn't magically gone away. If anything, the situation has become far more dire than even the worst we'd imagined: More than 4,100 people died of Covid-19 in the U.S. on Inauguration Day, in what has become a steady pace of record-breaking days. President Joe Biden warned that we should expect deaths to climb to 500,000.

So you can see why it feels strange for me to say I'm ready to feel hopeful when thinking about Covid-19 again. Even stranger is that my hope springs from the new administration's being willing to look the American people squarely in the eye and say, as Biden did Thursday: ""Let me be very clear — things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.""

""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one,"" Biden said before signing 10 executive orders addressing the Covid-19 response. They included orders to speed testing, get new rules about safety out to workplaces and use the Defense Production Act to increase the supplies needed for tests and vaccine distribution. He also promised that his administration ""will always be honest and transparent with you about the good news and the bad. We will level with you when we make a mistake.""

That's exactly what Biden promised standing on the Capitol steps during his inaugural address. When the last administration took its cues from the president, his dishonesty seeped into every corner of the federal response; Biden's blunt confrontation with reality has an opposite effect. And the relief that is inspiring in me is almost overwhelming.

Take the vaccine rollout: Public health experts have convinced me that there should be more screaming about how amazingly effective the vaccines the U.S. has approved so far really are, which the Biden team hopes to correct. His administration wants to administer 100 million vaccination shots in 100 days, supercharging the Trump administration's effort, which a source told CNN was basically nonexistent. ""There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,"" the source said.

Biden's new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, didn't sugarcoat how far behind the line of scrimmage they're starting from. She went on ""TODAY"" on Thursday and countered former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's claim that vaccinations will be available for the masses in their local pharmacies next month.

Mandating that people traveling on trains and planes wear masks? Groundbreaking.

""We are going to, as part of our plan, put the vaccine in pharmacies. Will it be in every pharmacy in this country by that timeline? I don't think so,"" Walensky said. ""I don't think late February we're going to have vaccine in every pharmacy in this country.""

White House chief of staff Ron Klain, promoting the Biden team's national Covid-19 strategy, said on Twitter: ""This isn't going to be easy, and it isn't going to be fast — sadly many more losses ahead. But we're going to have a plan and we're going to take this on full bore.""

It's not like the new national strategy is a work of staggering genius. Some of the stuff in there is so commonsensical that it hurts. Frequent briefings from experts on the latest in the pandemic? Novel. The federal government's reimbursing states for the cost of emergency protective gear for schools? Amazing. Mandating that people traveling on trains and planes wear masks? Groundbreaking.

""That it is possible for Joe Biden and his team to release a plan this straightforward is the most damning indictment of the Trump administration's coronavirus response imaginable,"" The New York Times' Ezra Klein wrote ahead of Biden's inauguration.

In the few months that I've been writing this column, I haven't been subtle about how bleak the Covid-19 situation is in this country. When the first vaccines were on the edge of approval, I warned against thinking we were home free. ""We haven't come to grips with any of what has happened to us so far in this forever year, meaning we can't possibly be braced for what's still to come,"" I wrote as winter approached.

It wasn't out of a need to be a pessimist or a hatred of the former president but because the truth of the calamity wasn't being reflected in our government's response. It was maddening and heartbreaking, and it left me feeling hollowed out. The climbing death toll was met with thoughts and prayers that faded into the ether while the virus remained firmly tethered to the Earth.

So why the change of heart? The short answer is that what the Biden administration has done in the last 48 hours is the equivalent of sitting down with a friend after a toxic breakup, one who readily confirmed, ""Yes, you were gaslit. None of what you experienced was in your imagination. It's real and scary, and I'm sorry.""

Yes, we're still living through an ongoing disaster that hasn't reached its apex. But the idea that the federal government is not only actually taking this pandemic seriously, it wants to help the millions of Americans suffering through it has forced a crack into the callous that had formed around any hope I still possess. We've got a long way to go still, clearly. There's no guarantee of success, especially without cooperation from Congress. But at least now the path no longer stretches into infinity in the darkness — we can see the next steps. And right now, that's what I need.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'going', 'administration', 'national', 'president', 'feel', 'biden', 'response', 'plan', 'pandemic', 'bidens', 'daring', 'vaccine', 'hopeful', 'far']",0

In addition, anyone who arrived from Brazil to Colombia between Jan. 18 and Wednesday will have to quarantine for 14 days. The Brazil P.1 variant was first identified in four travelers who were tested at an airport outside Tokyo. It contains a set of mutations that may affect its ability to be recognized by antibodies, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Alabama, Alaska announce first cases of U.K. variant Race to stop spread of highly-contagious Covid variant Jan. 27, 2021 01:23 Alabama and Alaska have joined a growing list of states where a Covid-19 variant first detected in the United Kingdom — and which is believed to be more transmissible — has been found. Health officials in Alabama said Wednesday that the variant, B.1.1.7., has been identified in three Alabamians, two of whom are children under 19 and one of whom is an adult. On Tuesday the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said testing had identified the state's first case of B.1.1.7., in an Anchorage resident who tested positive for Covid-19 in December. They and another person they lived with who also got sick recovered, and both isolated while sick, it said. The U.K. variant has been detected in more than two dozen states. It is believed to be more transmissible but it doesn't appear to be more likely to make someone seriously ill or to kill someone, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last week.

Virginia enacts Covid-19 workplace safety standards Virginia has enacted permanent Covid-19 workplace health and safety standards to protect workers. The standards ""mandate personal protective equipment, sanitation, social distancing, infectious disease preparedness and response plans, record-keeping, training, and hazard communications in workplaces,"" according to a statement from the office of Virginia's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam. “No Virginia worker should have to weigh their family’s economic security against their physical safety,” the governor's chief workforce development adviser, Megan Healy, said in the statement. “These permanent standards provide workers with essential recourse if faced with this untenable decision while giving businesses a clear understanding of the steps they must take to maintain a safe working environment.” The standards require all employees who interact with the public to wear masks. Employers must make hand sanitizer readily available. The new rules also lay out guidelines for returning to work after testing positive for Covid-19. In July, Virginia became what Northam said was the first state in the nation to adopt emergency temporary workplace safety and health requirements in response to the pandemic in the absence of federal regulations. Since then, at least six other states have adopted Covid-19 workplace standards, Northam's office said. The Virginia Department of Labor and Industry will enforce the permanent requirements. So far, the department has received more than 13,000 complaints concerning Covid-19 workplace safety, with 100 needing a full investigation due to serious concerns and 27 employers being cited, the governor's office statement said.

Long Beach vaccine distributing outpacing the rest of California The port city of Long Beach, in Los Angeles County, is outpacing the rest of California when it comes to vaccine distribution, Mayor Robert Garcia said during an Instagram Live discussion with Gov. Gavin Newsom. The city, which has its own health department, is ""pretty much done"" vaccinating its medical workers with more than 50 percent having received second doses as of this week. Long Beach is now vaccinating people 65 years and older, teachers and food workers. ""We've been planning for six months,"" Garcia said. ""I would argue we have one of the best vaccine rollouts in the state of California."" California and Los Angeles County, in particular, continues to experience rollout difficulties amid confusion, frustration and short supplies. As of last week, L.A. has received roughly 850,000 doses but requires 4 million to complete shots for health care workers and seniors over the age of 65 who are eligible to receive the vaccine, according to public health officials. Both California and county public health officials have blamed dwindling supplies at the federal level for vaccine distributions problems at the local level. Share this -

Oklahoma seeking to return $2 million worth of hydroxychloroquine OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma attorney general’s office is attempting to return $2 million worth of a malaria drug once touted by former President Donald Trump as an effective treatment for COVID-19, a spokesman said Wednesday. Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter, said Hunter is attempting to negotiate a return of the 1.2 million hydroxychloroquine pills Oklahoma acquired in April from a California-based supplier, FFF Enterprises. He said the office was acting on a request from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which authorized the purchase. A spokeswoman for FFF Enterprises didn’t immediately return a message Wednesday seeking comment. The attempt by Oklahoma to return the hydroxychloroquine was first reported by the online news publication The Frontier. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt defended the purchase last year, saying the drug was showing some promise as a treatment in early March and he didn’t want to miss an opportunity to acquire it. “I was being proactive to try and protect Oklahomans,” Stitt said at the time. The drug has since been shown to have little or no effect on severe cases of Covid-19, and a former state health official chalked up Oklahoma’s purchase to something that happens in “the fog of war.” While governments in at least 20 other states obtained more than 30 million doses of the drug through donations from the federal reserve or private companies, Oklahoma and Utah bought them from private pharmaceutical companies. Then-Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, initially defended the state’s $800,000 purchase of 20,000 packets of hydroxychloroquine compounded with zinc, but later canceled an additional plan to spend $8 million more to buy 200,000 more treatments. The state then managed to secure a refund on the $800,000 no-bid contract it signed with a local pharmacy company that had been promoting the drugs. The CEO of the pharmacy company has since pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor for mislabeling the drug imported from China. Dan Richards, the operator of Meds In Motion, acknowledged receiving large amounts of the drug from an unregistered manufacturer in China incorrectly labeled as an herbal supplement. His lawyer has said he trying to help procure as much of the product as possible because at the time it seemed like a promising treatment for the coronavirus. Share this -

Auschwitz survivors mark liberation anniversary online amid pandemic WARSAW, Poland — A Jewish prayer for the souls of the people murdered in the Holocaust echoed Wednesday over where the Warsaw ghetto stood during World War II as a world paused by the coronavirus pandemic observed the 76th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Most International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorations were being held online this year due to the virus, including the annual ceremony at the site of the former Auschwitz death camp, where Nazi German forces killed 1.1 million people in occupied Poland. The memorial site is closed to visitors because of the pandemic. In one of the few live events, mourners gathered in Poland's capital to pay their respects at a memorial in the former Warsaw ghetto, the largest of all the ghettos where European Jews were held in cruel and deadly conditions before being sent to die in mass extermination camps.

Cuomo: If supply weren't an issue, all of New York state could be vaccinated in a month With an adequate supply of Covid-19 vaccines, everyone in New York state could be vaccinated within one month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. ""That's the real shame,"" Cuomo told MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. ""One month, we could get the state done. We have 3,000 providers who are now online. We have mass distribution sites that could do hundreds of thousands [of doses]. This is purely a supply issue."" Speaking a day after President Joe Biden announced his administration is working to buy 200 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines — enough to inoculate nearly everyone in the United States by the end of the summer — Cuomo slammed the Trump administration for not buying more earlier. Cuomo: If supply weren't an issue New York could be vaccinated in a month Jan. 27, 2021 00:58 ""What was shocking about President Biden's announcement yesterday was that the United States government hadn't even ordered enough medicine. How do you treat a pandemic? First, order the medicine necessary,"" he said. The purchase from the Biden administration comes in addition to the 400 million doses pharmaceutical companies have already promised to the U.S., for a total of 600 million doses — enough for 2 doses for 300 million Americans. ""The president said honestly, which is always refreshing, it's going to take six months to get that number of doses,"" Cuomo said. ""I wish the previous administration had done that.""

White House task force introduces plan to increase number of vaccinators White House officials announced on Wednesday a plan to speed up the administration of vaccines and avoid bottlenecks from resource constraints. Jeff Zients, head of the President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 task force, said the Department of Health and Human Services will introduce changes to the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) to allow retired doctors and nurses to administer shots and to enable licensed doctors and nurses to help out with vaccinations across state lines. The PREP Act is designed to provide immunity from liability, but amendments are often introduced to address public health emergencies and enforce countermeasures to fight infectious diseases.

Peru sees second Covid wave, orders total lockdown of capital and 9 other regions LIMA, Peru - President Francisco Sagasti of Peru on Tuesday night announced a total lockdown of the capital and nine other regions following a significant increase in Covid-19 cases, which he said had pushed hospitals close to collapse. Sagasti said the new measures covering central Peru would remain in effect until at least Feb. 14. They include instructions to work from home, the closure of all nonessential shops, the suspension of interregional land and air travel, and the extension of a ban on flights coming from Europe to flights from Brazil in a bid to curb new, more contagious strains of the virus. On Tuesday, Peru reported 4,444 new cases of the coronavirus, taking its total to 1,107,239, and 40,107 deaths. According to Reuters data here, Peru's cases are at 57 percent of an Aug. 22 peak, when more than 9,000 new cases were confirmed. Sagasti said Covid-19 vaccines were the way out of the crisis and pledged to be among the first to receive the shot. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

Moderna confirms talks with federal government to deliver another 100 million doses Moderna confirmed Wednesday it was in discussions with the federal government to deliver another 100 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine later this year. “To date, the U.S. government has agreed to purchase 200 million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine,” the drugmaker said in a statement. “This new purchase would bring the U.S. government’s confirmed order commitment to 300 million doses.” President Joe Biden revealed Tuesday the government was working to buy 200 million more vaccine doses, which would be enough to inoculate every American by the end of the summer.

Biden to sit out Covid briefing as part of a new plan to talk to Americans WASHINGTON — When the Biden administration holds its first coronavirus briefing Wednesday, there will be no cameo from the president, no speakers behind the White House podium jousting with reporters, and no data coming from outside the federal agencies involved in the pandemic response. And in a sign of the awareness of the risks of putting people in a room together, the briefing won't even be held in person. It will be a different scene from the coronavirus news briefings of the Trump administration, which often became freewheeling televised spectacles with the president jockeying with journalists. It's one of the clearest signs yet of how President Joe Biden is taking a vastly different approach when it comes to talking to the American people. From the start of the pandemic, public health officials have been making the case that combating the virus requires a communal effort. Biden and his pandemic advisers argue that changing the way information gets to the public will be one of the primary ways to turn around the trajectory of the pandemic.

Japan's PM apologizes after politicians break rules and visit nightclubs Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologized Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited nightclubs, despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to stop the spread of Covid-19. ""I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8 p.m. and to avoid nonessential, nonurgent outings,"" Suga told Parliament. Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo to curb a sharp rise in cases. Japanese people vented on Twitter at the double standards of politicians. ""I want them to quit!

Sanofi to lend rival Pfizer-BioNTech a hand with vaccines in Europe French drugmaker Sanofi will help rivals Pfizer and BioNTech manufacture 125 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine for the European Union, the company announced Wednesday. The news comes as the E.U. struggles with the rollout of coronavirus vaccines, falling behind other parts of the world, including the U.S. and the neighboring U.K. Sanofi will manufacture the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in its Frankfurt facility this summer. “We are very conscious that the earlier vaccine doses are available, the more lives can potentially be saved,” Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson said. “We have made the decision to support BioNTech and Pfizer in manufacturing their Covid-19 vaccine in order to help address global needs, given that we have the technology and facilities to do so.” Share this -

January now the deadliest month of the pandemic The U.S. has counted 80,677 reported Covid-19 deaths in January as of Wednesday morning, more than December's 77,124 dead and the the most in any month of pandemic, according to an NBC News tally. On Tuesday, the country counted 169,687 cases and 3,718 reported deaths, bringing the totals to 25.5 million cases and 426,586 deaths as of Wednesday morning. The U.S. has averaged 3,367 deaths and 169,687 cases per day in the last week. Four weeks ago, that number was 2,615 deaths and 224,938 cases. These states set single-day records: Alabama, 234 dead

At-home Covid tests offer promises — and challenges Three new completely at-home Covid-19 tests are hitting the market soon, promising to deliver results within minutes. The BinaxNow, Lucira and Ellume tests all offer slight variations on a similar approach: swab, insert and get results without even leaving your kitchen table, in 30 minutes or less. The tests offer promising accessibility: No visits to a doctor or clinic, or scheduling a drive-through at a pharmacy. And, since patients don’t have to leave home, it's easier for them to take the test, decreasing the risk they might infect others. “If millions of Americans tested themselves at home twice a week we would start to see dramatic reductions in cases within a month or two,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

China administered more than 22M vaccine doses so far BEIJING — China has given more than 22 million coronavirus vaccine shots to date as it carries out a drive ahead of next month’s Lunar New Year holiday, health authorities said Wednesday. The effort, which began six weeks ago, targets key groups such as medical and transport workers and has accelerated vaccinations in China. About 1.6 million doses had been given over several months before the campaign began. “The carrying out of vaccination has been ongoing in a steady and orderly manner,” Zeng Yixin, vice chairman of the National Health Commission Said at a news conference. He said that 22.76 million doses had been administered as of Tuesday. It’s not clear how many people that represents since the vaccine is given in two doses, and some may have received their second shot. China, which largely stopped the spread of the virus last spring, has seen fresh outbreaks this winter in four northern provinces. About 1,800 new cases have been reported since mid-December, including two deaths. Authorities are strongly discouraging people from traveling during the Lunar New Year holiday, a time when Chinese traditionally return to their hometowns for family gatherings. Share this -

Poorer countries will lag 6 to 8 months behind richer nations in vaccine rollout Poorer countries face a best-case scenario of a 6 to 8 month lag behind richer nations in getting access to Covid-19 vaccines to protect their populations against the pandemic disease, the philanthropist Bill Gates said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters, Gates called the rollout of the first Covid-19 shots a ""super hard allocation problem"" that was putting pressure on global institutions, governments and drugmakers. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has so far committed some $1.75 billion to the global response to the pandemic, including via funds for the COVAX vaccine-sharing initiative co-led by the World Health Organization, and via direct support for some vaccine makers. It hopes to start some deliveries next month. ""The total number of doses that GAVI (and COVAX) will have in the first half of the year is still very modest,"" he said. ""Yes, they will get some doses out, but if you compare when they will reach the same percentage of coverage as the rich countries — that's where I'd say it's six to eight months, best case.""

900 Holocaust survivors have died of Covid-19, Israel says Around 900 people who survived the Holocaust died from Covid-19 in Israel during the pandemic, according to the country’s Central Bureau of Statistics. The figures were released Tuesday, a day ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day, an international day of remembrance to honor the millions of European Jews and other groups killed during the Holocaust between 1941 and 1945. Some 5,300 Holocaust survivors contracted the virus last year, Israel reported. All Holocaust survivors are over the age of 75 — World War II ended 75 years ago — and approximately 17 percent are over 90. There are around 179,600 survivors living in Israel. Share this -

2021-01-27 11:02:04+00:00,80,"WASHINGTON — The government is working to buy 200 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines, a move that could provide enough doses to fully inoculate nearly every American by the end of the summer, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.

The government is seeking 100 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million from Moderna, an order that would be made available over the summer. They would be in addition to the 400 million combined doses the companies had already committed to provide the U.S., Biden said. He said he expects to be able to confirm the purchase soon.

""It will be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans to beat the pandemic,"" Biden said.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The agreement would lessen the country's reliance on getting additional doses on the market from other manufacturers. The Trump administration had passed on buying more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna and was instead betting that additional vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca would come to market. Johnson & Johnson said it will release data for its single-dose vaccine in the coming days.

""We can't speak to the Trump administration, but what we can say is it is our philosophy, given the nature of this emergency and the speed with which the virus needs to be addressed, to procure enough supply as we need to vaccinate Americans and to give Americans the confidence we can do that,"" a senior administration official said.

In the near term, the supplies being shipped to states are set to increase by about 20 percent, to 10 million doses a week, for the next three weeks, the official said. The federal government will also begin letting states know how many doses they will be getting at least three weeks in advance — addressing complaints by governors that they aren't able to plan and schedule appointments.

The Biden administration has begun using the Defense Production Act to buy more of a special syringe that can extract more doses per vaccine vial, and it plans to use the wartime law for other raw materials, like lipid nanoparticles and bioreactor bags, if necessary, the official said.

But the supply chain for those relatively rare materials is ""somewhat fragile,"" and there is a risk of disrupting production of other health care products, the official said. The U.S. also has to compete with other countries for the same resources.

The official said the administration isn't holding back doses aside from a small emergency reserve, but states have been holding back the doses they receive at different levels to ensure that enough is available for people to get their second shots.

State and local officials have been complaining in recent weeks that while they can give more shots and that demand from the public is high, they lack the supply of vaccines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that as of Tuesday, 23.5 million doses were administered and that more than 3.4 million people were fully vaccinated.

But Georgia House Speaker David Ralston said the lawmaker, Rep. David Clark, has repeatedly refused to follow House policy which states that all members and staff be tested for the coronavirus twice a week.

""The member in question had been advised numerous times about the requirements and had refused to be tested at any point during this session,"" Ralston's office said in a statement on Twitter.

""The member refused to leave of his/her own accord. As such, under the authority granted to the Speaker by House Rules, the member was escorted out of the Chamber by a member of the Georgia Department of Public Safety.""

Clark, a Republican, said in an emailed statement Tuesday that he arrived at the chamber ready to follow the required protocols by wearing a mask, social distancing and having his temperature taken.

But ""what I will not do is be forced to have a Covid test, or any unnecessary medical test, done without a basis for doing so,"" he said.

""The seat that I hold for District 98 is not my seat, but the people’s seat. I work for you, and I cannot in good conscience watch expensive tests that should be given to Georgia citizens who desperately need them be wasted for nothing more than political optics at the Capitol.""

During an interview with a WXIA reporter, a maskless Clark said that when he walked into the chamber this morning, he was told he was not allowed to be in there. He said he doesn't agree with the twice-a-week testing policy because there are essential workers who are not able to get tested.

""I check my temperature when I come in. When I go in the chambers, I wear my mask. I follow the protocols they want in the chamber but two tests a week is wrong on my conscience when teachers can't get it and first responders can't get it,"" he told the reporter. ""We get two tests but nobody else gets the same thing out there. My grandma doesn't get two tests.""

In a December memo, Ralston said that all members and House staff are required to be tested for the coronavirus twice a week during the 2021 Session. Masks must be worn while on Capitol grounds and may only be taken off when a member is addressing the House.

Ralston said in his statement that Clark will be allowed to return to the chamber after he complies with the policy.

""This is about preventing the spread of a disease that has killed more than 12,000 Georgians,"" he said.

2021-01-27 03:35:01+00:00,34,"Contrary to some lies we've heard in the last year, we didn't suddenly stop talking about the coronavirus after Election Day. It hasn't magically gone away. If anything, the situation has become far more dire than even the worst we'd imagined: More than 4,100 people died of Covid-19 in the U.S. on Inauguration Day, in what has become a steady pace of record-breaking days. President Joe Biden warned that we should expect deaths to climb to 500,000.

So you can see why it feels strange for me to say I'm ready to feel hopeful when thinking about Covid-19 again. Even stranger is that my hope springs from the new administration's being willing to look the American people squarely in the eye and say, as Biden did Thursday: ""Let me be very clear — things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.""

""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one,"" Biden said before signing 10 executive orders addressing the Covid-19 response. They included orders to speed testing, get new rules about safety out to workplaces and use the Defense Production Act to increase the supplies needed for tests and vaccine distribution. He also promised that his administration ""will always be honest and transparent with you about the good news and the bad. We will level with you when we make a mistake.""

That's exactly what Biden promised standing on the Capitol steps during his inaugural address. When the last administration took its cues from the president, his dishonesty seeped into every corner of the federal response; Biden's blunt confrontation with reality has an opposite effect. And the relief that is inspiring in me is almost overwhelming.

Take the vaccine rollout: Public health experts have convinced me that there should be more screaming about how amazingly effective the vaccines the U.S. has approved so far really are, which the Biden team hopes to correct. His administration wants to administer 100 million vaccination shots in 100 days, supercharging the Trump administration's effort, which a source told CNN was basically nonexistent. ""There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,"" the source said.

Biden's new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, didn't sugarcoat how far behind the line of scrimmage they're starting from. She went on ""TODAY"" on Thursday and countered former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's claim that vaccinations will be available for the masses in their local pharmacies next month.

Mandating that people traveling on trains and planes wear masks? Groundbreaking.

""We are going to, as part of our plan, put the vaccine in pharmacies. Will it be in every pharmacy in this country by that timeline? I don't think so,"" Walensky said. ""I don't think late February we're going to have vaccine in every pharmacy in this country.""

White House chief of staff Ron Klain, promoting the Biden team's national Covid-19 strategy, said on Twitter: ""This isn't going to be easy, and it isn't going to be fast — sadly many more losses ahead. But we're going to have a plan and we're going to take this on full bore.""

It's not like the new national strategy is a work of staggering genius. Some of the stuff in there is so commonsensical that it hurts. Frequent briefings from experts on the latest in the pandemic? Novel. The federal government's reimbursing states for the cost of emergency protective gear for schools? Amazing. Mandating that people traveling on trains and planes wear masks? Groundbreaking.

""That it is possible for Joe Biden and his team to release a plan this straightforward is the most damning indictment of the Trump administration's coronavirus response imaginable,"" The New York Times' Ezra Klein wrote ahead of Biden's inauguration.

In the few months that I've been writing this column, I haven't been subtle about how bleak the Covid-19 situation is in this country. When the first vaccines were on the edge of approval, I warned against thinking we were home free. ""We haven't come to grips with any of what has happened to us so far in this forever year, meaning we can't possibly be braced for what's still to come,"" I wrote as winter approached.

It wasn't out of a need to be a pessimist or a hatred of the former president but because the truth of the calamity wasn't being reflected in our government's response. It was maddening and heartbreaking, and it left me feeling hollowed out. The climbing death toll was met with thoughts and prayers that faded into the ether while the virus remained firmly tethered to the Earth.

So why the change of heart? The short answer is that what the Biden administration has done in the last 48 hours is the equivalent of sitting down with a friend after a toxic breakup, one who readily confirmed, ""Yes, you were gaslit. None of what you experienced was in your imagination. It's real and scary, and I'm sorry.""

Yes, we're still living through an ongoing disaster that hasn't reached its apex. But the idea that the federal government is not only actually taking this pandemic seriously, it wants to help the millions of Americans suffering through it has forced a crack into the callous that had formed around any hope I still possess. We've got a long way to go still, clearly. There's no guarantee of success, especially without cooperation from Congress. But at least now the path no longer stretches into infinity in the darkness — we can see the next steps. And right now, that's what I need.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'going', 'administration', 'national', 'president', 'feel', 'biden', 'response', 'plan', 'pandemic', 'bidens', 'daring', 'vaccine', 'hopeful', 'far']",0
2021-01-27 03:12:03+00:00,20,"MEXICO CITY—Mexicans hope President Andrés Manuel López Obrador makes a speedy recovery from Covid-19, though many believe he could have avoided infection if he had more strictly followed the government’s own health advice - and worn a face mask.

López Obrador's diagnosis on Sunday capped the deadliest week of the coronavirus pandemic in the country with the world's fourth-highest death toll.

“He wasn’t looking after himself, always walking around without a mask, and not respecting social distancing,” said Mexico City rubbish collector Luis Enrique Flores, wheeling his cart past a wall plastered with government posters urging people to wear masks.

López Obrador, who quit smoking after a heart attack in 2013, insists he is careful, and has deferred to the recommendations of his coronavirus czar, deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell, when asked why he does not wear a mask.

Opinion polls show most Mexicans approve of his management of the health crisis, and his popularity has, if anything, improved in the pandemic, during which he has maintained a busy schedule and continued touring Mexico.

However, his aversion to wearing a mask is out of step with public opinion, polls suggest.

A July survey by newspaper El Financiero showed 86% of Mexicans felt masks helped prevent Covid-19 spread, while nearly nine in ten said they always wore one when leaving home, a study by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky showed on Monday.

“He should take better care of himself, he should wear a mask because he never wears one in his news conferences,” said Noe Méndez, a street vendor in Mexico City.

Only when flying is the president really ever seen in a mask. But his decision to board a plane on Sunday a few hours before he revealed he had Covid-19 prompted criticism that he was undermining the government’s own message.

Marisol González, who runs a food stall in the capital, said many ordinary Mexicans had to go to far greater lengths to keep themselves safe and their businesses afloat.

Mexicans are fretting increasingly about access to healthcare as the pandemic stretches hospitals, but Reina Luisa Hernández, a massage therapist whose livelihood has been shattered by the pandemic, said the president would get the sort of attention “not available to the vast majority of Mexicans.”

Others hope the president learns from his experience.

“It’s good that he knows how it feels, how people are suffering,” said Teresa López, a digital magazine editor. “Now he should adopt a stricter approach.”

Steven Brandenburg was fired from the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, Wisconsin, in December after the hospital said he admitted he ""intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration.” Brandenburg, a pharmacist, agreed to plead guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard, the Department of Justice said.

The charges carry with them a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count.

“According to the plea agreement, Brandenburg stated that he was skeptical of vaccines in general and the Moderna vaccine specifically,” the department said Tuesday. “Brandenburg had communicated his beliefs about vaccines to his co-workers for at least the past two years.”

Prosecutors said that Brandenburg intentionally removed doses of the Moderna vaccine from its refrigeration during two successive overnight shifts last month, possibly rendering them ineffective because the vaccine vials must be stored at specific temperatures.

Brandenburg then returned the vaccines to the refrigerator after knowing that they had been left out, leading to 57 people being injected with the potentially spoiled inoculations, the Department of Justice said.

Grafton police said Brandenburg is an ""admitted conspiracy theorist"" and he ""told investigators that he believed that Covid-19 vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their DNA.""

The Wisconsin Pharmacy Examining Board suspended Brandenburg’s license earlier this month which would not allow him to practice at a pharmacy in the state.

Anyone who tampers with doses of Covid-19 doses will face justice, U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger said Tuesday.

“Distributing the COVID-19 vaccine is critical to overcoming this pandemic, which continues to end lives and upend our economy,” Krueger said.

Moderna and Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccines, currently approved for emergency use in the U.S., are not yet widely available. States have struggled to meet demand as supply chains for the inoculations, competing for a scarce resource against each other and the rest of the world.

I follow the protocols they want in the chamber but two tests a week is wrong on my conscience when teachers can't get it and first responders can't get it,"" he told the reporter. ""We get two tests but nobody else gets the same thing out there. My grandma doesn't get two tests.""

In a December memo, Ralston said that all members and House staff are required to be tested for the coronavirus twice a week during the 2021 Session. Masks must be worn while on Capitol grounds and may only be taken off when a member is addressing the House.

Ralston said in his statement that Clark will be allowed to return to the chamber after he complies with the policy.

""This is about preventing the spread of a disease that has killed more than 12,000 Georgians,"" he said.

In addition to being removed, Ralston said that Clark will no longer be assigned office space in the legislative building over his refusal to follow protocols.",MSNBC,"['test', 'lawmaker', 'tests', 'chamber', 'house', 'clark', 'removed', 'refusing', 'member', 'tested', 'statement', 'state', 'follow', 'georgia', 'covid']",0

2021-01-26 21:43:53+00:00,189,"WASHINGTON — The government is working to buy 200 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines, a move that could provide enough doses to fully inoculate nearly every American by the end of the summer, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.

The government is seeking 100 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million from Moderna, an order that would be made available over the summer. They would be in addition to the 400 million combined doses the companies had already committed to provide the U.S., Biden said. He said he expects to be able to confirm the purchase soon.

""It will be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans to beat the pandemic,"" Biden said.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The agreement would lessen the country's reliance on getting additional doses on the market from other manufacturers. The Trump administration had passed on buying more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna and was instead betting that additional vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca would come to market. Johnson & Johnson said it will release data for its single-dose vaccine in the coming days.

""We can't speak to the Trump administration, but what we can say is it is our philosophy, given the nature of this emergency and the speed with which the virus needs to be addressed, to procure enough supply as we need to vaccinate Americans and to give Americans the confidence we can do that,"" a senior administration official said.

In the near term, the supplies being shipped to states are set to increase by about 20 percent, to 10 million doses a week, for the next three weeks, the official said. The federal government will also begin letting states know how many doses they will be getting at least three weeks in advance — addressing complaints by governors that they aren't able to plan and schedule appointments.

The Biden administration has begun using the Defense Production Act to buy more of a special syringe that can extract more doses per vaccine vial, and it plans to use the wartime law for other raw materials, like lipid nanoparticles and bioreactor bags, if necessary, the official said.

But the supply chain for those relatively rare materials is ""somewhat fragile,"" and there is a risk of disrupting production of other health care products, the official said. The U.S. also has to compete with other countries for the same resources.

The official said the administration isn't holding back doses aside from a small emergency reserve, but states have been holding back the doses they receive at different levels to ensure that enough is available for people to get their second shots.

State and local officials have been complaining in recent weeks that while they can give more shots and that demand from the public is high, they lack the supply of vaccines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that as of Tuesday, 23.5 million doses were administered and that more than 3.4 million people were fully vaccinated. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday on MSNBC that the city has the capacity to administer 500,000 doses a week but that it hasn't been able to do so because it is waiting on more vaccine supplies from the federal government.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'johnson', 'administration', 'supply', 'states', 'doses', 'biden', 'orders', 'official', 'weeks', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'million', '200']",0

2021-01-26 19:43:06+00:00,19,"I imagine January has been a relatively good month for Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Covid-19 pandemic appears to be largely under control in his country, and China's is the only major economy in the world expected to report growth for 2020. Meanwhile, several thousand people a day are dying from the virus in Xi's archrival across the Pacific, the United States. The resurgence of infections keeps sending shock waves through the U.S. economy.

When you peel back the layers, there's a distinct price that has come with the normalcy, mostly in the form of human rights violations.

And on Jan. 7, Xi would have awakened to see images from the previous day of lawmakers crouching under desks or fleeing in fear when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol.

The glee of China's state media was palpable: ""History has not ended. What has ended is the myth of America."" On Jan. 11, Xi told a gathering of government officials that ""the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, but time and the situation are in our favor.""

The contrast between the tumult in the U.S. and the apparent normalcy in China is making some people in China more supportive of their government. But when you peel back the layers, there's a distinct price that has come with the normalcy, mostly in the form of human rights violations.

It's an unexpected turn of fate; a little more than a year ago, China was in a state of emergency as Covid-19 was raging through the country, infuriating millions of people over the government's cover-up of the virus. Some people at the time asked me whether the virus would bring down the ruling Chinese Communist Party.

On Jan. 23, 2020, in a frantic attempt to limit the virus from spreading, Chinese authorities abruptly imposed draconian measures to restrict movement in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. Officials were seen sealing apartment doors to prevent people from leaving their homes. Videos circulated online showing residents yelling from their homes in despair.

By April, the official number of daily new cases stayed in the single digits, and no new deaths were reported.

Many agonizing stories emerged, despite stringent censorship: A man with kidney disease jumped to his death from his apartment balcony after he couldn't get access to health care facilities for dialysis. And a boy with cerebral palsy died at home alone after his dad, who was his sole caretaker, was taken away to be quarantined.

It was brutal. But by April, the official number of daily new cases stayed in the single digits, and no new deaths were reported.

To people in Wuhan and other places subjected to restrictions, the memory of losing loved ones to the virus and living under harsh lockdowns might still be fresh and painful. But to many people in the rest of the country, the sacrifices seemed necessary, thanks to censorship that prevents victims from speaking about the abuses they endured, as well as propaganda that glorified suffering.

""Tens of thousands of people ... in the context of the national population of 1.4 billion ... aren't a big deal,"" a Weibo user wrote. ""We do not avoid speaking about sacrifices, because sacrifices have led to the glorious victory of our nation,"" the state news agency Xinhua stated in April. ""Wuhan must win, Hubei must win, because China must win.""

Meanwhile, in ""free"" America, 23 million people have been infected and more than 400,000 have died from complications of Covid-19. Some people contend that there is a ""constitutional right not to wear masks"" and insist that ""vaccines cause autism,"" while Chinese state media inundate their Chinese audience with images, statistics and stories of people hospitalized and dying in the U.S., prompting the many messages from my friends and relatives in China asking: ""Are you OK? What's going on in America?""

Beijing has imprisoned many human rights activists, lawyers, journalists and religious personnel for advocating for ideas unsanctioned by the Communist Party.

Beijing's purported ""victory"" in containing the virus compared to the U.S. has prompted some ruling elites and ordinary people in China to express support for public order and security over individual freedoms. ""Only by safeguarding public interest can individual rights be protected,"" wrote a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research center. ""The individual should give way to the collective. This is what harmony is about,"" said a Weibo post calling for Wuhan people not to leave the city.

Such views aren't the result of the pandemic and the short period of heightened censorship and propaganda. They're the result of decades of continuous suppression of liberal ideas and activism, which has increased since Xi ascended to power in late 2012.

In the past decade, authorities have tightened control over almost every aspect of Chinese society, including the internet, academia, the media and civil society groups, in which ideas of human rights and democracy enjoyed some room for debate after China opened up its economy and international exchanges soared.

Beijing has imprisoned many human rights activists, lawyers, journalists and religious personnel for advocating for ideas unsanctioned by the Communist Party. Many people in the younger generation have grown up never having heard of or used Twitter and Google. They have come to believe that the government's stringent internet censorship has protected them from false information and the country from the turmoil the U.S. is experiencing now.

The same censorship has persisted in the Covid-19 crisis. Authorities scrubbed social media posts that criticized the government from the internet, sentenced citizen journalist Zhang Zhan to four years in prison, kicked out over a dozen foreign journalists and stonewalled the World Health Organization's investigation into the origin of the virus.

Despite the hypervigilance — and perhaps giving credence to those who question its Covid-19 track record — Beijing still struggles to keep the country virus-free. This month, new, small outbreaks in Hebei and Jilin provinces again prompted authorities to put tens of million people under strict lockdown.

But whether the virus has been contained — and whether people will continue to cheer an approach based on repression — may mean a future less rosy for Xi than he'd be willing to admit.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'virus', 'xi', 'success', 'china', 'censorship', 'chinas', 'chinese', 'wuhan', 'country', 'tragedy', 'rights', 'human', 'covid']",0

Dov Forman, 17, shared a picture of Ebert's first post-Covid walk and called it a ""miraculous recovery.""

Forman said he and his father contracted the virus last April, yet Ebert was able to stay healthy. But a few weeks after receiving her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Dec. 17, she said she began to feel ill.

""I was very tired, very sleepy. I really don't know what it is, but I felt very down. You could not do anything. It is terrible,"" Ebert said.

Forman said Ebert tested positive for Covid-19 in January and spent three weeks at home while recovering. He said doctors would make daily visits to the London home in order to make sure she was taking all the necessary medication.

Forman recalls the family not wanting Ebert to end up in a hospital, out of fear of never seeing her again. The teen recalls his entire family being worried on days when they saw her in a critical stage, but they had hope she would recover.

""But we knew, she's a fighter, she's obviously a survivor of Auschwitz and many other things in her life and she never gives up, and she's, as I said to my tweet, a true survivor, a true fighter, and we knew she'd get through it, and she didn't give up, and that's how, thank God, she recovered,"" Forman said.

The global lockdowns from Covid-19 have allowed Forman and his great grandmother to bond as they work on conserving and sharing the memories of Ebert's days in Auschwitz and the importance of sharing that history, he said.

Forman's first viral tweet this past July allowed his great grandmother to reunite with the family of the U.S. soldier who left her a note when she was liberated.

Ebert said she arrived to Auschwitz on the last transport from Hungary on July 9, 1944. She spent four months in the camp as a teen and was forced to work in a factory as a slave.

And it was there that she lost her mother, brother and sister.

""More or less, 100 other people from the family, aunties, uncles, nephews, everybody. They killed,"" Ebert said.

Despite all that Ebert has gone through in her life, she expressed the same sentiment for surviving both the Holocaust and Covid-19.

""It is fantastic when you can say for everything, 'I managed, I am here. I went through it, and I am here,'"" Ebert said. ""I think the only thing what you can do, never, ever give up because it is always hope.""

As long as you have hope, ""everything can happen,"" she said. ""So never give up hope.""

Ebert and her great grandson have enjoyed sharing her story with the world so much that they are writing a memoir of her life and expect it to release in September.

""I just realized she isn't going to live forever and there's not much time left with camp survivors and it's so important to use your platform to share testimony because that's the way forward,"" Forman said.

Forman hopes that his great grandmother's story will inspire others to do the same in sharing and preserving the history of those who experienced the Holocaust camps.

In a one-line order, the court said it would not hear an appeal from Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley, a church in western Nevada that has been battling pandemic restrictions imposed by Gov. Steve Sisolak. The rules originally allowed casinos, restaurants and other businesses to operate at 50 percent capacity while limiting churches to no more than 50 people, regardless of a facility's size.

The state has since imposed a 25 percent capacity limit on most public gathering places, including movie theaters, casinos, restaurants, bars and religious constitutions. It therefore is not engaged in religious discrimination, lawyers for the state told the Supreme Court.

But the church said the state still treats some places more favorably, such as retail businesses, professional offices and manufacturing plants, which are either allowed a higher capacity or face no limit other than a requirement for social distancing.

Since the pandemic began, the Supreme Court has shifted ground on deferring to state restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus. During the spring and summer, the court rejected efforts to lift limits on church attendance in California, Nevada and Illinois.

But the arrival of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who succeeded liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, led to a change in direction. In October the court blocked an order from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo limiting attendance to 10 people in areas where the disease was rapidly spreading. Those regulations ""single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment,"" the decision said.

The court then ordered lower courts to reconsider their rulings upholding capacity limits in California, Colorado and New Jersey.

And in early January, the court allowed the Trump administration to enforce a rule requiring women to appear in person at clinics to receive two pills for a medication abortion. A lower court had put the rule on hold citing health risks caused by the pandemic.",MSNBC,"['allowed', 'court', 'capacity', 'religious', 'worship', 'restrictions', 'declines', 'pandemic', 'attendance', 'church', 'state', 'supreme', 'services']",0

2021-01-25 13:02:04+00:00,81,"The newly appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Sunday that the federal government remains in the dark about just how much vaccine is currently available and warned that states like New York won't be able to quickly replenish its limited supply.

“One of the biggest problems right now is I can't tell you how much vaccine we have, and if I can't tell it to you then I can't tell it to the governors and I can't tell it to the state health officials,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Walensky added the government does not ""have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York [or] for other states that are claiming to have run out of vaccine.""

As President Joe Biden pledges to distribute 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in his first 100 days, Walensky said ""the supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on.""

""We're really hoping that after that first 100 days we'll have much more production,"" she added.

The Biden administration last week released its comprehensive plan for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, including an increase in the number of vaccination sites and ramped-up vaccine production. The virus has claimed more than 418,000 American lives and infected upwards of 25 million across the U.S., according to an NBC News tracker.

According to Bloomberg’s vaccine distribution tracker, the U.S. recently hit a pace of 1 million vaccinations per day. The CDC reports that more than 20.5 million doses have been administered across the country as of Saturday— about half of what states have on hand. The vast majority of those who have been vaccinated have only received their first of the two necessary doses.

An NBC News poll found that just 11 percent of registered voters say the vaccination process has been going ""very well,"" with 31 percent saying it is going ""fairly well."" Of those who say the rollout has not gone well, 64 percent place blame primarily on the federal government.

In an interview with CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that aired Sunday, Dr. Deborah Birx — who coordinated the Trump White House's Covid-19 response — said the former president had ""no team, full-time team in the White House working on coronavirus.""

Xavier Becerra, Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, was asked in an interview Sunday with CNN's ""State of the Union"" whether the Biden team was seeking to lower expectations on vaccine distribution so that success would be viewed as a major achievement.

“Well, if the plane is diving like this, you're certainly not going to see it appear like this overnight,"" he said. ""What you're trying to do is get the plane from being like this to getting straightened out, and then going like this. In three — in 100 days, getting 100 shots out there on vaccines, 100 million shots out there in vaccines, is incredibly important. It's ambitious, it's bold, it's doable. We have to do it. But we have to recognize that we're doing it while the plane is in a dive like this.”

And in an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the goal of 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of Biden's administration was ""bold"" and ""ambitious"" but ""we need to keep going after that.""

""That is our first goal, it’s not our final goal, it’s not the endpoint, it’s just a metric the American people can watch and measure how we are doing,"" he said.",MSNBC,"['going', 'struggling', 'administration', 'states', 'vaccinations', 'biden', '100', 'cant', 'data', 'days', 'lack', 'tell', 'director', 'million', 'white', 'vaccine', 'cdc']",0
2021-01-25 12:23:04+00:00,58,"Pharmaceutical giant Merck said Monday that it was discontinuing the development of its two Covid-19 vaccine candidates after early clinical trial data showed an ""inferior"" immune response.

Merck said in a statement posted on its website the decision to scrap the two vaccine candidates followed its review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies. The studies showed that both candidates were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection with Covid-19 and those reported for other Covid-19 vaccines.

Merck was late to join the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the virus, which has so far killed more than 2 million people worldwide and infected nearly 100 million.

U.S. regulators authorized Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna, and Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, in December, and tens of millions of doses of both have so far been administered globally as governments around the world rush to vaccinate as many people as possible to lift damaging lockdowns.

Rivals Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc and others are also working to develop vaccines to protect against the virus.

Merck still plans to submit the results of the Phase 1 studies for the two scrapped vaccine candidates for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, its statement said.

The company will now focus on two Covid-19 investigational medicines and other Covid-19 research, the statement added.

Minnesota reports first known case of Brazil coronavirus variant in the U.S. Minnesota public health officials announced what appears to be the first known case of the coronavirus' Brazil P.1 variant in the nation. The patient with variant is a resident of Minneapolis/St. Paul who became ill after traveling to Brazil, the Minnesota Department of Health said. The strain was found among the 50 random samples analyzed every week as part of the state's variant surveillance program, according to the health department. The Brazil variant is a distinct variation from those seen in Britain and South Africa and thought to be more transmissible than the coronavirus strain that was prevalent at the beginning of the pandemic. ""The good news is that we can slow the spread of this variant and all COVID-19 variants by using the tried-and-true prevention methods of wearing masks, keeping social distance, staying home when sick, and getting tested when appropriate,"" Minnesota Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm said Monday.

Biden ups vaccine goal to 1.5 million shots a day, says vaccine to be widely available by spring WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said he expects anyone who wants a vaccine to be able to get one by the spring and he upped his vaccination goal for his first 100 days in office. Biden said Monday he now thinks the country can administer 1.5 million shots a day in the coming weeks and give 150 million vaccinations over the next 100 days, “with the grace of god.” In December, Biden set a goal of 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days and at the time, no vaccine had been cleared for use. But with states ramping up their vaccination efforts in recent weeks, the country is already averaging Biden's goal of around 1 million shots a day. In order to reach his new goal, Biden said the federal government is going to have to set up more vaccination sites, hire more people to administer the vaccines, and ensure there are enough supplies of things like syringes. He is asking Congress for more than $400 billion to fund those efforts. “It is going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that,” Biden said. He said that by summer “we're gonna be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity” including making the vaccine available for children. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

California is ramping up its lagging vaccination effort, governor says California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that the nation’s most populous state was ramping up its lagging vaccination effort, tripling the number of doses given daily between the beginning of the month and Jan. 15. On Jan. 4, 43,000 doses were administered across the state, he said. Eleven days later, that number was 131,000. The state’s goal is to continue to substantially increase that number, he said. Experts have attributed the slow rollout to everything from the state’s size to limited federal funding, and California’s efficient health care system, with its lack of extra medical workers trained to administer the vaccinations. Newsom said Monday that California is “like a large ship. It takes a little to shift course.” He also announced the launch of a centralized vaccination scheduling system that can be accessed through a smartphone app. The platform is being tested in two of the state’s largest counties — San Diego and Los Angeles — and will be rolled out across the rest of California by early February, he said.

Google to put vaccination sites on its search and map apps Google said Monday that its search and map apps would soon display information about where to get Covid-19 vaccinations, beginning in four states. “In the coming weeks, Covid-19 vaccination locations will be available in Google Search and Maps, starting with Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, with more states and countries to come,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post. Information about vaccinations has been hard to come by in some places, and Pichai said searches for “vaccines near me” had increased fivefold since the beginning of the year. He said Google would rely on authoritative sources, such as government agencies and retail pharmacies, to gather the information. Google is contributing $150 million in advertising credits so that public health agencies and nonprofits can run announcements and information campaigns, Pichai said. He also said Google planned to make select buildings available as needed for vaccination sites. Share this -

Vaccine tourism on the rise as wealthy international tourists eye an opportunity in the U.S. Shortly before the Covid-19 vaccine made its debut last month in the United States, an Indian travel agency called Gem Tours & Travels announced it was registering customers for an exciting new package: four-day trip from Mumbai to New York City with a coronavirus shot thrown in for about $2,000. ""Vaccine tourism,"" Nimesh Shah, the company's business development specialist, called it. “We are only taking registrations of Indians with a valid 10-year U.S. visa,” Shah told ThePrint. “We are not taking any money but just collecting data for the moment. We are proud to have coined the term ‘vaccine tourism’.” Soon, competitors like the Kolkata-based Zenith Holidays were registering customers for vaccination packages. Pronab Sarkar, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, condemned the companies for peddling these junkets. But Zenith Holidays, which generally does not offer travel packages to the U.S., still has on its website a ""Vaccine Tourism"" tab where customers can fill out a registration form, click send, and within minutes an email from the company pops up in their inbox promising more information soon. “Thank you for showing interest in our Holiday,” the email states. Just how many Indians signed up for such a vaccination junket to the U.S. was not immediately clear because neither Shah nor anyone from Zenith Holidays responded to several emails from NBC News or an inquiry posed via the registration form. But the very idea that somebody with money but no immediate access to the scarce Covid-19 vaccine could fly to another country to get a shot was raising both outrage and ethical questions.

California lifts regional coronavirus stay-at-home orders California lifted its stay-at-home orders for all regions statewide Monday, citing improving coronavirus conditions, health officials announced. The order had been in place for large swaths of the state, covering the San Joaquin Valley, the Bay Area and Southern California. “Californians heard the urgent message to stay home as much as possible and accepted that challenge to slow the surge and save lives,” Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a statement Monday. “Together, we changed our activities knowing our short-term sacrifices would lead to longer-term gains. Covid-19 is still here and still deadly, so our work is not over, but it’s important to recognize our collective actions saved lives and we are turning a critical corner.” The move means outdoor dining and personal services could now resume. Statewide counties will return to a system of county-by-county restrictions that decide which activities and businesses are open, the statement said. The statement added four-week intensive care unit capacity projections for the three regions previously under the stay-at-home orders were above 15 percent, the threshold that allows regions to exit the order. With the order, California also ended a curfew limiting nonessential activities between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Share this -

Budweiser will sit out Super Bowl, funnel marketing dollars to boost vaccine awareness Budweiser will not be running a commercial during the Super Bowl for the first time in 37 years. Instead, the Anheuser-Busch InBev beer will use the marketing dollars to support Covid-19 vaccine awareness and access. Budweiser isn’t the only iconic brand sitting out the game. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have said they won’t be running in-game ads for their namesake sodas. Pepsi is instead focusing on its sponsorship of the halftime show, which stars The Weeknd. PepsiCo’s other brands, including Mountain Dew and Frito-Lay, are planning on airing commercials during the game. Last year’s Super Bowl drew about 100 million viewers, but attracting those eyeballs comes with a hefty price tag for advertisers. A 30-second commercial during the football game will set companies back about $5.5 million this year. Read the story here. Share this -

U.S. goal to squeeze more Covid shots from Pfizer vials hampered by syringe production The world’s largest syringe maker does not have the capacity to substantially increase U.S. supplies of specialty syringes needed to squeeze more doses from Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine vials in the coming weeks, an executive said in an interview. The vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, one of two authorized for U.S. emergency use, is shipped in vials initially indicated to hold five doses. Six doses can be drawn with special syringes, called low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use. Syringe maker Becton Dickinson has contracted with the U.S. government to provide 286 million syringes for use with Covid-19 vaccines, including around 40 million low dead space syringes, and is fully prepared to deliver on that agreement, said Troy Kirkpatrick, the company’s senior director of public relations. Low dead space syringes are a niche product and Becton Dickinson had not discussed plans with the U.S. government to substantially boost their output when they began preparing for the vaccine rollout last year, he said. “We are ready to support the U.S. government but we are trying to make sure everyone understands that those devices are not something we have infinite capacity to produce and bringing up new lines does take time,” Kirkpatrick said.

Merck discontinues two Covid-19 vaccine candidates Pharmaceutical giant Merck said Monday that it was discontinuing the development of two Covid-19 vaccine candidates after early clinical trial data showed an ""inferior"" immune response. Merck said in a statement posted on its website the decision to scrap the two vaccine candidates followed its review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies. The company said the studies showed that both candidates were generally well-tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other Covid-19 vaccines.

Israel bans international flights amid fears of new variants Israel is set to stop all international travel from Monday night as it seeks to prevent the spread of new coronavirus variants. The flight ban will come into effect at midnight and last until the end of the month, according to a statement released by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. ""Other than rare exceptions, we are closing the sky hermetically to prevent the entry of the virus variants and also to ensure that we progress quickly with our vaccination campaign,"" Netanyahu said in public remarks at the start of a Cabinet meeting. Exceptions for departures include emergency medical evacuations and attending a funeral overseas of a close relative. The country's borders have already largely been closed to foreigners during the pandemic, with only Israeli passport holders allowed entry. Share this -

2021-01-25 06:32:04+00:00,32,"Dr. Deborah Birx, who had been one of the White House's chief coronavirus response coordinators, said Friday she considered quitting under former President Donald Trump, whose cavalier attitude toward combatting the disease created consternation among public health officials.

Birx, in a clip of released by CBS News' ""Face The Nation,"" said she ""always"" considered quitting, particularly once colleagues began to view her differently after becoming one of the faces of the response to the coronavirus pandemic under Trump. The full interview will air on Sunday.

""I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that every day? Colleagues of mine that I've known for decades — decades — in that one experience, because I was in the White House, decided that I had become this political person, even though they've known me forever,"" she said in the interview.

""I had to ask myself every morning: is there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic? And it's something I asked myself every night,"" Birx said.

Birx, who came under some criticism for traveling and hosting Thanksgiving with her family as Covid-19 cases skyrocketed, was in the White House briefing room in April 2020 when Trump suggested that injecting bleach, or other disinfectants — as well as light — could kill the virus. She was noticeably uncomfortable as the president turned to her and asked whether she had ever heard about heat killing the virus in humans.

Her comments comes a day after Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the government’s other top public health experts, said he feels free to speak honestly about Covid-19 now that Trump is out of office. Fauci said that the new administration was committed to being ""completely transparent, open and honest,"" a sharp break from the Trump White House when Fauci said he often felt there would be repercussions for speaking honestly about the pandemic.

Birx, who said she never withheld information from the public, suggested in the interview that she felt stuck trying to effectively work with the Trump administration on combating Covid-19, prompting her to recraft public messaging.

""And, when it became a point where ... I wasn't getting anywhere, and that was right before the election, I wrote a very detailed communication plan — what needed to happen the day after the election, and how that needs to be executed,"" she said ""And, there was a lot of promises that would happen.""

This past December, Birx said in an interview with the news site Newsy that she plans to retire but did not give a timeframe for her exit. She said at the time she wants to first help President Joe Biden’s team ""in any role"" with its coronavirus response.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'considered', 'day', 'president', 'deborah', 'birx', 'dr', 'response', 'trumps', 'house', 'white', 'fauci', 'coordinator', 'public', 'trump', 'interview', 'quitting']",0
2021-01-25 02:24:58+00:00,43,"MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Sunday that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and that his symptoms were light and he was receiving medical treatment.

""As always, I am optimistic,"" said López Obrador, 67, who has resisted wearing a mask.

Mexico is in the grip of a second wave of the pandemic, and it has the fourth-highest death toll worldwide.

The Health Ministry on Sunday reported 10,872 new confirmed coronavirus cases and 530 deaths, bringing its totals to 1,763,219 infections and 149,614 deaths.

Hospitals are overwhelmed by the surge. The real number of infected people and deaths is likely to be significantly higher than the official count, the Health Ministry has said.

López Obrador said on Twitter that his interior minister would run his regular morning news conference in his absence.

""Fortunately, the president is stable at the moment, the symptoms are mild,"" José Luis Alomía Zegarra, said a Mexican health official, said during a regular news conference held shortly after López Obrador announced his diagnosis. ""A team of medical specialists is attending to the health of the president.""

López Obrador has maintained a busy public schedule during the pandemic and has said he enjoys good health, despite having suffered a serious heart attack at age 60 in 2013.

He said he would still hold a scheduled call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday and keep an eye on public affairs while receiving treatment.

Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter that the leaders would address ""the future of the bilateral relationship, as well as the supply of Russian vaccines to Mexico.""

The government said this month that it aims to acquire 12 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V, with the first potentially arriving as soon as this week.

Mexico aims to administer 7.4 million doses of Sputnik V by the end of March as the country scrambles to quickly secure as great a supply of vaccines as possible.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only vaccine being administered in Mexico. The government said Friday that the second round of doses could be delayed and that private companies will be allowed to purchase the drugs directly as the country struggles to keep rampant infections in check.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'symptoms', 'tests', 'president', 'positive', 'health', 'doses', 'twitter', 'mexican', 'vaccines', 'v', 'vaccine', 'obrador', 'lópez']",0
2021-01-24 23:02:06+00:00,179,"The newly appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Sunday that the federal government remains in the dark about just how much vaccine is currently available and warned that states like New York won't be able to quickly replenish its limited supply.

“One of the biggest problems right now is I can't tell you how much vaccine we have, and if I can't tell it to you then I can't tell it to the governors and I can't tell it to the state health officials,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Walensky added the government does not ""have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York [or] for other states that are claiming to have run out of vaccine.""

As President Joe Biden pledges to distribute 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in his first 100 days, Walensky said ""the supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on.""

""We're really hoping that after that first 100 days we'll have much more production,"" she added.

The Biden administration last week released its comprehensive plan for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, including an increase in the number of vaccination sites and ramped-up vaccine production. The virus has claimed more than 418,000 American lives and infected upwards of 25 million across the U.S., according to an NBC News tracker.

According to Bloomberg’s vaccine distribution tracker, the U.S. recently hit a pace of 1 million vaccinations per day. The CDC reports that more than 20.5 million doses have been administered across the country as of Saturday— about half of what states have on hand. The vast majority of those who have been vaccinated have only received their first of the two necessary doses.

An NBC News poll found that just 11 percent of registered voters say the vaccination process has been going ""very well,"" with 31 percent saying it is going ""fairly well."" Of those who say the rollout has not gone well, 64 percent place blame primarily on the federal government.

In an interview with CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that aired Sunday, Dr. Deborah Birx — who coordinated the Trump White House's Covid-19 response — said the former president had ""no team, full-time team in the White House working on coronavirus.""

Xavier Becerra, Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, was asked in an interview Sunday with CNN's ""State of the Union"" whether the Biden team was seeking to lower expectations on vaccine distribution so that success would be viewed as a major achievement.

“Well, if the plane is diving like this, you're certainly not going to see it appear like this overnight,"" he said. ""What you're trying to do is get the plane from being like this to getting straightened out, and then going like this. In three — in 100 days, getting 100 shots out there on vaccines, 100 million shots out there in vaccines, is incredibly important. It's ambitious, it's bold, it's doable. We have to do it. But we have to recognize that we're doing it while the plane is in a dive like this.”

And in an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the goal of 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of Biden's administration was ""bold"" and ""ambitious"" but ""we need to keep going after that.""

2021-01-24 19:01:10+00:00,97,"Charlee Roos had two screens propped up on her desk: an iPad and a laptop. On one, the 15-year-old was attending her remote high school classes. On the other, Charlee was glancing at a livestream of her dad set up by doctors in the Minnesota hospital where he was being treated for complications of Covid-19.

“I was kind of keeping my eye on both, and sometimes I would have to tune out school to hear what doctors were saying,” said Charlee, whose family lives in the St. Paul suburb of Little Canada. “I would say, ‘Hey, what’s his hemoglobin? What’s his blood pressure look like?’”

They were questions Charlee knew her father, Kyle Roos, a pharmacist, would be asking if he were not on a ventilator. Asking them for him, she hoped, would help him focus on getting better.

But on Dec. 23, doctors called Charlee’s mother, Jaclyn Roos, to tell her Kyle had just hours to live. Jaclyn, Charlee and Charlee’s 10-year-old sister, Layla, were permitted to come to Kyle’s bedside to say goodbye.

Holding her father’s frail hand, Charlee made a promise.

“Dad,” she said through tears, “I’m going to try my best to do everything I can to make you proud.”

As the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic increases, it is leaving a growing path of children who have lost parents in its wake. They are children for whom Covid-19 has stolen not just their mom or dad, but future memories, too: a father walking them down the aisle at their wedding, or a mother beaming at their graduation.

Some of these children say they wish they were in heaven with their parents. Some struggle to eat or concentrate in school. Some have started therapy at only 2 years old.

“She just felt like if she went to sleep, there was a chance that she would wake up, and Mommy wouldn’t be there or Mommy could die.”

In Waldwick, New Jersey, 5-year-old Mia Ordonez’s father, Juan Ordonez, went to the hospital on the night of March 21 while Mia was sleeping due to his worsening Covid-19 symptoms. He died April 11, five days before her birthday.

Afterward, Mia was terrified to go to sleep, said her mother, Diana Ordonez.

“She went to sleep one day, and Dad never came home,” she said. “She just felt like if she went to sleep, there was a chance that she would wake up, and Mommy wouldn’t be there or Mommy could die.”

A generation thrust into grief

There is limited data on how many children across the United States have had a parent die of Covid-19. But grief during childhood is not rare: Even prior to the pandemic, an estimated 1 in 14 children in the U.S. were projected to experience the death of a parent or sibling by age 18, according to Judi’s House/JAG Institute, a research-based nonprofit child and family bereavement center.

Experts say losing a loved one to Covid-19 brings a unique grief that can be particularly confusing for children.

Families may not be able to hold a funeral, potentially hindering the process of accepting the reality of the death. A child may be isolated due to schools not being open, meaning support systems are not physically present in their lives. A child may fear that other adults are going to die of Covid-19, too, a worry that can be difficult to assuage when there is no clear end to the pandemic.

And among some circles, children may encounter stigma or even denial about the seriousness of the virus.

“Nobody says cancer isn’t real,” said Jessica Moujouros, program director for Children’s Grief Connection, a nonprofit that provides camps and programs for bereaved children and families. “The complications on top of complications on top of complications are just tearing my heart.”

Children who have lost a parent to the pandemic may face extra difficulties not just with how they mourn, but with what are known as secondary losses, too.

“When someone close to you dies, you lose the person — that’s the primary loss — but you also lose everything that person did, could have done and might have done for you in the future,” said Dr. David Schonfeld, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician who is the director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “During the pandemic, those secondary losses have become more pressing.”

They include things like loss of income, which could result in food insecurity, or having to move and start at a new school.

But secondary losses are not always financial, Schonfeld said. Maybe that parent was the one who made sure a child got their homework done or monitored that they took their asthma medication.

In Detroit, Jeremiah Hill, 7, lost two people close to him in less than two months to Covid-19: his father and a cousin who used to babysit him, said his mother, Loretta Sailes. After his dad, Eugene Hill, died April 5, Jeremiah showed little emotion; in the months since, he has started bringing up the activities that he misses doing with him. Sailes is never sure how to respond.

“It’s really hard,” Sailes said. “I just am like, ‘Yes, Jeremiah, you’re correct,’ but there’s really nothing you can say.”

Therapy has helped Jeremiah start to process his feelings, Sailes said. Once the pandemic ends, Sailes plans to start taking him to church — something Jeremiah misses doing most with his father.

Meanwhile, in Phoenix, when Mayra Millan Angulo, a single mother, died Dec. 14, she left behind six children, ages 6 to 25. Her oldest, Vanessa Pérez, is now the caregiver for her younger siblings, helping with their remote school and figuring out how she will stay on top of the family’s expenses. At the same time, she is trying to soothe the grief of her sister and four brothers while also dealing with her own.

Her youngest sibling, Melanie, brings their mother up frequently, Pérez said.

“If we pass by somewhere, she’s like, ‘Oh, Mommy used to take me there.’ I put on a black sweater the other day and she said, ‘Oh, that’s like Mommy’s.’ She mentions her all the time. She says she misses her,” Pérez said.

“I try to be as cheerful as possible and say, ‘Hey, yeah, you’re right,’ or ‘Yeah, you and Mommy had lunch dates there,’” she said. “But it breaks my heart on the inside.”

How to help a child grieve, even at a distance

Even as the pandemic upends daily life, there are ways that parents, educators and other adults can help a child cope with loss. There are national and local bereavement groups, many of which are doing virtual support groups. And many schools have counselors, social workers or psychologists who can work with children or recommend outside resources.

Simply acknowledging the loss is an important first step — something that some educators or other adults may not do out of fear that they will say something that makes the child feel worse, Schonfeld, the pediatrician, said.

“Saying nothing is the worst thing to do in a crisis, because it suggests to kids that the adults are unaware or unwilling to help,” he said.

“Saying nothing is the worst thing to do in a crisis, because it suggests to kids that the adults are unaware or unwilling to help.”

Generally, reaching out to a child and their family, telling them you are sorry for their loss and offering to be there for them is well received.

Approaches that should be avoided, Schonfeld said, would be trying to cheer the child up; telling them they have to be strong; and anything that starts with “at least,” such as “At least he’s not in pain,” or “At least you got to spend the holidays together.”

The widows who spoke to NBC News for this story said practicing self-care was critical to helping themselves and their children, especially after suddenly becoming single parents.

For Ordonez, joining a Facebook group for young widows and widowers who lost their spouses to Covid-19 has helped. She has become friendly with the creator of the group, Pamela Addison, who happens to live in her New Jersey town.

Addison’s husband, Martin Addison, died of the coronavirus April 29, leaving Addison with their two young children, Elsie, 2, and Graeme, 14 months. After his death, Elsie wouldn’t really eat; sometimes, she would just sit and stare, Addison said.

Addison put Elsie in therapy and entered therapy herself as well, in part to learn how to help her children with their emotions. When Elsie gets agitated, Addison said she “validates it’s OK to be sad, it’s OK to be upset, it’s OK to feel this way.”

In Minnesota, 15-year-old Charlee Roos’ mother, Jaclyn Roos, has simple rules for herself and her two girls to help them from spiraling into depression.

Every day, everyone must shower; leave the house, even if it’s just to walk the dog; spend 10 minutes cleaning; and talk to someone outside their household. For the most part, they have been holding each other accountable.

The family is slowly adjusting to life without Kyle. They used to eat dinner around 9:15 p.m. when he got home from his shift at the pharmacy. Now, Roos said, they eat dinner at 6:30 or 7 p.m. — normal dinner time for other families, but a foreign time to theirs that makes their father’s absence more pronounced each evening.

“He was such an amazing person that I am so glad that I got to spend even 15 years of my life with.""

Charlee has channeled her grief into her studies. She is determined to get into a good college so she can get a job that would have made her dad proud.

Her biggest hope is that no other families go through what she is experiencing: the loss of a parent who can never be replaced.

“My dad was such a wonderful person and wonderful example of giving an abundance of love to everyone,” Charlee said.

“He was such an amazing person that I am so glad that I got to spend even 15 years of my life with,” she added. “I wouldn’t change it for the world.”

While Klain called the aim “bold,” he said it is just an opening benchmark to show the American people they are moving quickly to vaccinate the country.

“One-hundred million shots is a bold, ambitious goal, but we need to keep going after that. That is our first goal, it’s not our final goal, it’s not the endpoint, it’s just a metric the American people can watch and measure how we are doing.”

The U.S. has hit the pace of 1 million vaccinations per day at the outset of the Biden administration, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine distribution tracker, putting the nation on track to hit that goal even as some experts say the new administration’s goal should be higher.

There had been more than 20.5 million coronavirus vaccine doses administered by Saturday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there was still a significant gap, more than 20 million, between the number of vaccines distributed and administered.

When asked about the gap, Klain said that the “complex” problem required a host of fixes. And he said that while the Trump administration did make “progress we are building on” with developing the vaccines and beginning the initial wave of distribution, he doubled down on the Biden administration’s criticism of its predecessors and said that a wider distribution plan “did not really exist when we came into the White House.”

“We need more vaccine, we need more vaccinators, we need more vaccination sites. And in the Biden administration, we are tackling all three,” Klain said.

“We are going to set up these federal vaccination centers to make sure that in states that don’t have enough vaccination sites, we fill those gaps. We’re going to work closely with the manufacturers to ramp up production.”

“We’re going to use all the powers we have in the White House,"" Klain added. ""We are going to work with Congress to get more funding to also accelerate this, so we can improve the rate at which we are vaccinating people.”

Covid-19 cases in America hit new peaks both after the Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas, but have started to drop in recent days. After a 16-day stretch in which there were more than 200,000 cases reported in all but one day, there have been six consecutive days with new, daily caseloads below 200,000.

But deaths have not yet seen the same decline. On two separate days last week, the country lost more than 4,100 people to the virus.",MSNBC,"['going', 'vaccinations', 'need', 'hit', 'biden', '100', 'start', 'days', 'chief', 'white', 'million', 'klain', 'vaccine', 'goal', 'staff', 'vaccination']",0

For Ordonez, joining a Facebook group for young widows and widowers who lost their spouses to Covid-19 has helped. She has become friendly with the creator of the group, Pamela Addison, who happens to live in her New Jersey town.

Addison’s husband, Martin Addison, died of the coronavirus April 29, leaving Addison with their two young children, Elsie, 2, and Graeme, 14 months. After his death, Elsie wouldn’t really eat; sometimes, she would just sit and stare, Addison said.

Addison put Elsie in therapy and entered therapy herself as well, in part to learn how to help her children with their emotions. When Elsie gets agitated, Addison said she “validates it’s OK to be sad, it’s OK to be upset, it’s OK to feel this way.”

In Minnesota, 15-year-old Charlee Roos’ mother, Jaclyn Roos, has simple rules for herself and her two girls to help them from spiraling into depression.

Every day, everyone must shower; leave the house, even if it’s just to walk the dog; spend 10 minutes cleaning; and talk to someone outside their household. For the most part, they have been holding each other accountable.

The family is slowly adjusting to life without Kyle. They used to eat dinner around 9:15 p.m. when he got home from his shift at the pharmacy. Now, Roos said, they eat dinner at 6:30 or 7 p.m. — normal dinner time for other families, but a foreign time to theirs that makes their father’s absence more pronounced each evening.

“He was such an amazing person that I am so glad that I got to spend even 15 years of my life with.""

Charlee has channeled her grief into her studies. She is determined to get into a good college so she can get a job that would have made her dad proud.

Her biggest hope is that no other families go through what she is experiencing: the loss of a parent who can never be replaced.

“My dad was such a wonderful person and wonderful example of giving an abundance of love to everyone,” Charlee said.

“He was such an amazing person that I am so glad that I got to spend even 15 years of my life with,” she added. “I wouldn’t change it for the world.”

2021-01-24 03:02:04+00:00,35,"With Covid-19 vaccines now approved for use by the FDA, there’s a lot of talk — and confusion — about how this massive rollout will reach people across the country.

While it’s hopeful news, the timeline for most people receiving vaccines is weeks or months away. That’s because the process of vaccinating millions of people takes time, and the vaccine supply needs to catch up with the demand.

This happens by increasing production of approved vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, and continuing to develop other vaccine candidates. The good news is that the FDA is expecting to review two additional vaccines, produced by Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca in the coming weeks.

And even now, with more limited availability, it’s up to individual states (and sometimes counties) to decide who is eligible for the vaccine. Some processes are smoother than others. But one thing for sure is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the process, which leads to stress, and sometimes desperation. Sadly, scammers are already showing up with fake offers for “shortcuts” and are preying on people’s fears.

While it’s hard to wait, it’s also essential to recognize there’s no immediate access to a vaccine through an “alternate” route. When it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Remember, whatever the pitch you’re given, never answer personal questions, or provide information like your full Social Security number or banking information. Scammers are often looking for personal information for identity, insurance and financial theft.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, here are some scams to beware of:

Scam #1: Being asked to pay out of pocket to receive the vaccine.

The Covid-19 vaccine is free, although there can be a very small fee attached to administer the vaccine.

Scam #2: Being asked to pay to get your name on a list for a vaccine appointment, or to get early access.

There is no special list to “cut the line” to get early access. You cannot pay for immediate access to a vaccine.

Scam #3: Being asked to respond immediately for a vaccine through advertisements on social media, emails, telephone calls, or on-line access.

Avoid all solicitations through ads or personal calls for a reservation for a vaccine, whether they request money or not. Sometimes personal information is requested, which you should never provide.

Scam #4: Being called by someone saying they are from the “government” or someone from your “health plan” will be calling you about getting you on a vaccine list.

No one from the government will call you about getting on a vaccine appointment list. And your own health plan will notify you in a personal way, and have your key information.

Scam #5: Receiving an offer to buy a vaccine, and have it shipped to you directly.

There are no “secret” sources of a vaccine that can be purchased. If anything is shipped, it will not be an authentic vaccine.

If you think you’ve been a victim of a vaccine scam, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

“We are the guinea pigs,” one said.

Nearly a month later, there has still not been a single dose of a licensed Western vaccine administered on the continent of Africa — even as roughly 60 million doses have been given worldwide.

This drastic disparity represents an outcome long feared by public health experts. It also underscores the colossal challenge ahead for the global coalition, known as COVAX, scrambling to secure vaccine doses for the world’s poorest nations.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

“The price of not solving the vaccine distribution problem internationally will be measured in lives,” said Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Even before the arrival of vaccines, the spread of the coronavirus laid bare the advantages wealthy nations enjoy in securing such critical resources as hospital ventilators and personal protective equipment for medical workers.

The same dynamic has played out in the global race to amass vaccine doses.

A small group of rich countries — comprising just 16 percent of the world’s population — have locked up 60 percent of the global vaccine supply, according to Duke University’s Global Health Institute.

Canada has already preordered enough potential doses to vaccinate its entire population nearly six times, and the U.S. has enough purchase options to vaccinate every American nearly five times, according to the institute.

The hoarding of vaccine doses has left the rest of the world scrambling.

Australia, Canada and Japan account for 1 percent of the world’s coronavirus cases, Bollyky said, but they have amassed more doses than all of Latin America and the Caribbean, which have close to 20 percent of cases. The coronavirus mortality rate in Africa rose to 2.5 percent this week, officials said, dwarfing the U.S. rate of 1.7 percent.

“What has happened here is nations have decided to worry more about the reactions of their populations at home rather than what is needed to be done to bring this pandemic under control,” said Bollyky, author of the book “Plagues and the Paradox of Progress.”

This “vaccine nationalism” has severe consequences, according to public health experts like Dr. Larry Brilliant.

Brilliant, a leading epidemiologist who helped eradicate smallpox, said the hoarding of vaccines by rich nations could trigger a tragic boomerang effect.

“Being at the front of the line doesn't help you as much as making sure that everybody gets across the line,” said Brilliant, the founder and CEO of Pandefense Advisory, a group of experts working to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Until everybody in the world is safe, no one is safe,” Brilliant added. “This is a pandemic. If one country is left unvaccinated, this disease will bounce back and forth. And all of us will be constantly besieged by it.”

COVAX was formed precisely for that reason.

The initial goal of the coalition, which includes global health groups like the World Health Organization and over 190 nations, is to buy 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 in order to inoculate 20% of the population in the 100 or so poorest countries.

“It’s the greatest logistical challenge on a scale we’ve not seen before in global public health,” said Gian Gandhi, COVAX coordinator for UNICEF, which is leading the group’s efforts to buy and deliver vaccines.

The total cost is expected to reach up to $17 billion, Gandhi said, but the coalition has only $2 billion on hand and has yet to receive even a single dose of coronavirus vaccine despite having agreements in place to secure 1.97 million doses.

COVAX did, however, make additional strides this week.

The coalition on Friday announced the signing of an advance purchase agreement with Pfizer for up to 40 million doses of its vaccine. COVAX also said it will exercise an option to receive its first 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

And earlier in the week, newly elected President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. would reinstate ties with the WHO and join the COVAX coalition, in a reversal of Trump administration policy.

But the coalition is still several billions short of the money it needs to pull off its ambitious goal.

“It doesn’t have the funding and the resources that it needs,” Brilliant said.

The COVAX initiative was born in part from a history lesson: an attempt by the global community to prevent rich countries from monopolizing vaccines in bilateral deals, like they did with swine flu vaccines in 2009.

The concept resembles a funding pool, where members pay into a central fund in return for enough vaccines to immunize 20 percent of their population.

For rich countries that can afford to negotiate their own supplies, it’s insurance in the event that a vaccine candidate they have preordered does not get approved by regulators. But for the world’s poorest countries, COVAX is a lifeline — the only viable path to receiving vaccine doses.

COVAX’s distribution will run out of the largest humanitarian warehouse in the world, a donation to UNICEF from the Danish government. The space spans three football fields, stacked higher than a mid-rise building with commodities from syringes to therapeutic food, soccer balls to water drilling rigs.

A box of supplies can travel from the Copenhagen hub to anywhere in the world within 72 hours. The vaccines — once secured — will be shipped directly by the manufacturers.

With the world’s wealthy countries hoarding vaccines, COVAX has resorted to pleas for donations of viable doses from wealthy countries — the sooner, the better.

“If there are vaccines that are going unused and being saved for a rainy day, those should be donated, because more can be produced,” said Gandhi, UNICEF’s chief of market shaping and supplier financing.

Both Canada and the European Union have said they are willing to donate surplus vaccines, but nothing has been cemented. According to UNICEF, COVAX has not received any donated vaccines.

Meanwhile, some nations that are struggling to get access to vaccines are doing what Guinea did, turning to less regulated vaccines out of China and Russia.

The state-backed doses already have takers in over a dozen different middle-income countries, including Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil and Egypt.

“The challenge that we have with COVAX is that currently, it's a charitable enterprise,” Bollyky said. “At the end of the day, charity is going to seem to a lot of politicians and national leaders as a second-order issue.”

“Until we recognize that having this initiative succeed is in our self-interest ... we're not going to see the kinds of investment and the kinds of behaviors from national leaders that we need to see to make progress,” Bollyky added.

One such argument is purely economic. According tothe RAND Corp., global GDP would drop nearly $300 billion each year if only high-income countries can get vaccinated, with $30 billion in losses specifically for the U.S. But if high-income countries paid for the supply of vaccines, they would get back $4.80 for every $1 spent, the policy research nonprofit estimated.

There are also many secondary consequences if developing nations are left unprotected. If COVAX can’t vaccinate front-line health care workers in developing nations, it could disrupt long-standing vaccination programs, Gandhi said, leading to a resurgence of diseases like measles and polio, which the world is close to eradicating.

But the biggest consequence of unequal global vaccination is a prolonged pandemic. A failure to vaccinate in Mali or Mozambique could mean a resurgence of the virus in America, endangering large numbers of people who won’t or can’t get the vaccine, such as children and people who are immunocompromised.

On the other, Charlee was glancing at a livestream of her dad set up by doctors in the Minnesota hospital where he was being treated for complications of Covid-19.

“I was kind of keeping my eye on both, and sometimes I would have to tune out school to hear what doctors were saying,” said Charlee, whose family lives in the St. Paul suburb of Little Canada. “I would say, ‘Hey, what’s his hemoglobin? What’s his blood pressure look like?’”

They were questions Charlee knew her father, Kyle Roos, a pharmacist, would be asking if he were not on a ventilator. Asking them for him, she hoped, would help him focus on getting better.

But on Dec. 23, doctors called Charlee’s mother, Jaclyn Roos, to tell her Kyle had just hours to live. Jaclyn, Charlee and Charlee’s 10-year-old sister, Layla, were permitted to come to Kyle’s bedside to say goodbye.

Holding her father’s frail hand, Charlee made a promise.

“Dad,” she said through tears, “I’m going to try my best to do everything I can to make you proud.”

As the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic increases, it is leaving a growing path of children who have lost parents in its wake. They are children for whom Covid-19 has stolen not just their mom or dad, but future memories, too: a father walking them down the aisle at their wedding, or a mother beaming at their graduation.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Some of these children say they wish they were in heaven with their parents. Some struggle to eat or concentrate in school. Some have started therapy at only 2 years old.

“She just felt like if she went to sleep, there was a chance that she would wake up, and Mommy wouldn’t be there or Mommy could die.”

In Waldwick, New Jersey, 5-year-old Mia Ordonez’s father, Juan Ordonez, went to the hospital on the night of March 21 while Mia was sleeping due to his worsening Covid-19 symptoms. He died April 11, five days before her birthday.

Afterward, Mia was terrified to go to sleep, said her mother, Diana Ordonez.

“She went to sleep one day, and Dad never came home,” she said. “She just felt like if she went to sleep, there was a chance that she would wake up, and Mommy wouldn’t be there or Mommy could die.”

A generation thrust into grief

There is limited data on how many children across the United States have had a parent die of Covid-19. But grief during childhood is not rare: Even prior to the pandemic, an estimated 1 in 14 children in the U.S. were projected to experience the death of a parent or sibling by age 18, according to Judi’s House/JAG Institute, a research-based nonprofit child and family bereavement center.

Experts say losing a loved one to Covid-19 brings a unique grief that can be particularly confusing for children.

Families may not be able to hold a funeral, potentially hindering the process of accepting the reality of the death. A child may be isolated due to schools not being open, meaning support systems are not physically present in their lives. A child may fear that other adults are going to die of Covid-19, too, a worry that can be difficult to assuage when there is no clear end to the pandemic.

And among some circles, children may encounter stigma or even denial about the seriousness of the virus.

“Nobody says cancer isn’t real,” said Jessica Moujouros, program director for Children’s Grief Connection, a nonprofit that provides camps and programs for bereaved children and families. “The complications on top of complications on top of complications are just tearing my heart.”

Children who have lost a parent to the pandemic may face extra difficulties not just with how they mourn, but with what are known as secondary losses, too.

“When someone close to you dies, you lose the person — that’s the primary loss — but you also lose everything that person did, could have done and might have done for you in the future,” said Dr. David Schonfeld, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician who is the director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “During the pandemic, those secondary losses have become more pressing.”

They include things like loss of income, which could result in food insecurity, or having to move and start at a new school.

But secondary losses are not always financial, Schonfeld said. Maybe that parent was the one who made sure a child got their homework done or monitored that they took their asthma medication.

In Detroit, Jeremiah Hill, 7, lost two people close to him in less than two months to Covid-19: his father and a cousin who used to babysit him, said his mother, Loretta Sailes. After his dad, Eugene Hill, died April 5, Jeremiah showed little emotion; in the months since, he has started bringing up the activities that he misses doing with him. Sailes is never sure how to respond.

“It’s really hard,” Sailes said. “I just am like, ‘Yes, Jeremiah, you’re correct,’ but there’s really nothing you can say.”

Therapy has helped Jeremiah start to process his feelings, Sailes said. Once the pandemic ends, Sailes plans to start taking him to church — something Jeremiah misses doing most with his father.

Meanwhile, in Phoenix, when Mayra Millan Angulo, a single mother, died Dec. 14, she left behind six children, ages 6 to 25. Her oldest, Vanessa Pérez, is now the caregiver for her younger siblings, helping with their remote school and figuring out how she will stay on top of the family’s expenses. At the same time, she is trying to soothe the grief of her sister and four brothers while also dealing with her own.

Her youngest sibling, Melanie, brings their mother up frequently, Pérez said.

“If we pass by somewhere, she’s like, ‘Oh, Mommy used to take me there.’ I put on a black sweater the other day and she said, ‘Oh, that’s like Mommy’s.’ She mentions her all the time. She says she misses her,” Pérez said.

“I try to be as cheerful as possible and say, ‘Hey, yeah, you’re right,’ or ‘Yeah, you and Mommy had lunch dates there,’” she said. “But it breaks my heart on the inside.”

How to help a child grieve, even at a distance

Even as the pandemic upends daily life, there are ways that parents, educators and other adults can help a child cope with loss. There are national and local bereavement groups, many of which are doing virtual support groups. And many schools have counselors, social workers or psychologists who can work with children or recommend outside resources.

Simply acknowledging the loss is an important first step — something that some educators or other adults may not do out of fear that they will say something that makes the child feel worse, Schonfeld, the pediatrician, said.

“Saying nothing is the worst thing to do in a crisis, because it suggests to kids that the adults are unaware or unwilling to help,” he said.

“Saying nothing is the worst thing to do in a crisis, because it suggests to kids that the adults are unaware or unwilling to help.”

Generally, reaching out to a child and their family, telling them you are sorry for their loss and offering to be there for them is well received.

Birx, in a clip of released by CBS News' ""Face The Nation,"" said she ""always"" considered quitting, particularly once colleagues began to view her differently after becoming one of the faces of the response to the coronavirus pandemic under Trump. The full interview will air on Sunday.

""I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that every day? Colleagues of mine that I've known for decades — decades — in that one experience, because I was in the White House, decided that I had become this political person, even though they've known me forever,"" she said in the interview.

""I had to ask myself every morning: is there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic? And it's something I asked myself every night,"" Birx said.

Birx, who came under some criticism for traveling and hosting Thanksgiving with her family as Covid-19 cases skyrocketed, was in the White House briefing room in April 2020 when Trump suggested that injecting bleach, or other disinfectants — as well as light — could kill the virus. She was noticeably uncomfortable as the president turned to her and asked whether she had ever heard about heat killing the virus in humans.

Her comments comes a day after Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the government’s other top public health experts, said he feels free to speak honestly about Covid-19 now that Trump is out of office. Fauci said that the new administration was committed to being ""completely transparent, open and honest,"" a sharp break from the Trump White House when Fauci said he often felt there would be repercussions for speaking honestly about the pandemic.

Birx, who said she never withheld information from the public, suggested in the interview that she felt stuck trying to effectively work with the Trump administration on combating Covid-19, prompting her to recraft public messaging.

""And, when it became a point where ... I wasn't getting anywhere, and that was right before the election, I wrote a very detailed communication plan — what needed to happen the day after the election, and how that needs to be executed,"" she said ""And, there was a lot of promises that would happen.""

2021-01-22 21:13:04+00:00,48,"With Covid-19 vaccines now approved for use by the FDA, there’s a lot of talk — and confusion — about how this massive rollout will reach people across the country.

While it’s hopeful news, the timeline for most people receiving vaccines is weeks or months away. That’s because the process of vaccinating millions of people takes time, and the vaccine supply needs to catch up with the demand.

This happens by increasing production of approved vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, and continuing to develop other vaccine candidates. The good news is that the FDA is expecting to review two additional vaccines, produced by Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca in the coming weeks.

And even now, with more limited availability, it’s up to individual states (and sometimes counties) to decide who is eligible for the vaccine. Some processes are smoother than others. But one thing for sure is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the process, which leads to stress, and sometimes desperation. Sadly, scammers are already showing up with fake offers for “shortcuts” and are preying on people’s fears.

While it’s hard to wait, it’s also essential to recognize there’s no immediate access to a vaccine through an “alternate” route. When it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Remember, whatever the pitch you’re given, never answer personal questions, or provide information like your full Social Security number or banking information. Scammers are often looking for personal information for identity, insurance and financial theft.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, here are some scams to beware of:

Scam #1: Being asked to pay out of pocket to receive the vaccine.

The Covid-19 vaccine is free, although there can be a very small fee attached to administer the vaccine.

Scam #2: Being asked to pay to get your name on a list for a vaccine appointment, or to get early access.

There is no special list to “cut the line” to get early access. You cannot pay for immediate access to a vaccine.

Scam #3: Being asked to respond immediately for a vaccine through advertisements on social media, emails, telephone calls, or on-line access.

Avoid all solicitations through ads or personal calls for a reservation for a vaccine, whether they request money or not. Sometimes personal information is requested, which you should never provide.

Scam #4: Being called by someone saying they are from the “government” or someone from your “health plan” will be calling you about getting you on a vaccine list.

No one from the government will call you about getting on a vaccine appointment list. And your own health plan will notify you in a personal way, and have your key information.

Scam #5: Receiving an offer to buy a vaccine, and have it shipped to you directly.

There are no “secret” sources of a vaccine that can be purchased. If anything is shipped, it will not be an authentic vaccine.

If you think you’ve been a victim of a vaccine scam, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

2021-01-22 18:46:01+00:00,46,"Contrary to some lies we've heard in the last year, we didn't suddenly stop talking about the coronavirus after Election Day. It hasn't magically gone away. If anything, the situation has become far more dire than even the worst we'd imagined: More than 4,100 people died of Covid-19 in the U.S. on Inauguration Day, in what has become a steady pace of record-breaking days. President Joe Biden warned that we should expect deaths to climb to 500,000.

So you can see why it feels strange for me to say I'm ready to feel hopeful when thinking about Covid-19 again. Even stranger is that my hope springs from the new administration's being willing to look the American people squarely in the eye and say, as Biden did Thursday: ""Let me be very clear — things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.""

""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one,"" Biden said before signing 10 executive orders addressing the Covid-19 response. They included orders to speed testing, get new rules about safety out to workplaces and use the Defense Production Act to increase the supplies needed for tests and vaccine distribution. He also promised that his administration ""will always be honest and transparent with you about the good news and the bad. We will level with you when we make a mistake.""

That's exactly what Biden promised standing on the Capitol steps during his inaugural address. When the last administration took its cues from the president, his dishonesty seeped into every corner of the federal response; Biden's blunt confrontation with reality has an opposite effect. And the relief that is inspiring in me is almost overwhelming.

Take the vaccine rollout: Public health experts have convinced me that there should be more screaming about how amazingly effective the vaccines the U.S. has approved so far really are, which the Biden team hopes to correct. His administration wants to administer 100 million vaccination shots in 100 days, supercharging the Trump administration's effort, which a source told CNN was basically nonexistent. ""There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,"" the source said.

Biden's new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, didn't sugarcoat how far behind the line of scrimmage they're starting from. She went on ""TODAY"" on Thursday and countered former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's claim that vaccinations will be available for the masses in their local pharmacies next month.

Mandating that people traveling on trains and planes wear masks? Groundbreaking.

""We are going to, as part of our plan, put the vaccine in pharmacies. Will it be in every pharmacy in this country by that timeline? I don't think so,"" Walensky said. ""I don't think late February we're going to have vaccine in every pharmacy in this country.""

White House chief of staff Ron Klain, promoting the Biden team's national Covid-19 strategy, said on Twitter: ""This isn't going to be easy, and it isn't going to be fast — sadly many more losses ahead. But we're going to have a plan and we're going to take this on full bore.""

It's not like the new national strategy is a work of staggering genius. Some of the stuff in there is so commonsensical that it hurts. Frequent briefings from experts on the latest in the pandemic? Novel. The federal government's reimbursing states for the cost of emergency protective gear for schools? Amazing. Mandating that people traveling on trains and planes wear masks? Groundbreaking.

""That it is possible for Joe Biden and his team to release a plan this straightforward is the most damning indictment of the Trump administration's coronavirus response imaginable,"" The New York Times' Ezra Klein wrote ahead of Biden's inauguration.

In the few months that I've been writing this column, I haven't been subtle about how bleak the Covid-19 situation is in this country. When the first vaccines were on the edge of approval, I warned against thinking we were home free. ""We haven't come to grips with any of what has happened to us so far in this forever year, meaning we can't possibly be braced for what's still to come,"" I wrote as winter approached.

It wasn't out of a need to be a pessimist or a hatred of the former president but because the truth of the calamity wasn't being reflected in our government's response. It was maddening and heartbreaking, and it left me feeling hollowed out. The climbing death toll was met with thoughts and prayers that faded into the ether while the virus remained firmly tethered to the Earth.

So why the change of heart? The short answer is that what the Biden administration has done in the last 48 hours is the equivalent of sitting down with a friend after a toxic breakup, one who readily confirmed, ""Yes, you were gaslit. None of what you experienced was in your imagination. It's real and scary, and I'm sorry.""

Yes, we're still living through an ongoing disaster that hasn't reached its apex. But the idea that the federal government is not only actually taking this pandemic seriously, it wants to help the millions of Americans suffering through it has forced a crack into the callous that had formed around any hope I still possess. We've got a long way to go still, clearly. There's no guarantee of success, especially without cooperation from Congress.

2021-01-22 14:14:06+00:00,126,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed two executive orders Friday to address the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, including expanding food stamps and beginning the process to require that everyone working for the federal government get a minimum wage of $15 an hour.

""We’re in a national emergency. We need to act like we’re in a national emergency. So we’ve got to move with everything we got,"" Biden said in a speech ahead of signing the orders.

""If we act now, our economy will be stronger in both the short and long run. That’s what economists both left, right and center are telling us.""

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The first order, which the White House called an ""all-of-government"" effort, asks the Agriculture Department to increase by 15 percent a Covid-19 food assistance program that provides nutritional assistance to families with children who would normally receive free or reduced-price lunches when schools were in regular sessions.

The order also expands the emergency increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, commonly known as food stamps, authorized by Congress to include those at the lowest income levels. That could provide a family with three children with more than $100 in extra benefits every two months, administration officials said.

National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said the orders, which add to a slew Biden has already approved, are ""not a substitute"" for the massive $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill that Biden hopes Congress will pass, but rather a ""critical lifeline"" for millions of Americans who need assistance now.

""The American people can't afford to wait. So many are hanging on by a thread,"" he said.

The order signed Friday also asks the Treasury Department to update the process it uses to issue direct payments after a number of qualifying Americans reported issues and delays getting the first two rounds of stimulus checks last year. The order also establishes a coordination system across federal agencies to help people better navigate what relief benefits they qualify for.

Biden's order also allows for workers who turn down employment out of concerns about health risks amid the pandemic to qualify for unemployment benefits.

""No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health or the health of loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic,"" Biden said.

The second executive order Biden signed revoked orders put in place by former President Donald Trump in an effort to restore collective bargaining power for federal workers. The second order also asks federal agencies to pay a $15-an-hour minimum wage.

Biden also started the planning to require federal contractors to pay a $15 minimum wage and to provide emergency paid leave.

Deese told reporters on Friday that he did not have an estimate as to how many federal workers and contractors are currently paid less than $15 an hour.

Biden inherits a deeply damaged economy, with about 900,000 Americans having filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the first labor market data released under his presidency. Coronavirus deaths in the country have surpassed 400,000.

Biden has signed a number of executive orders since he took office Wednesday to swiftly roll back some Trump-era policies, as well as tackle the coronavirus.

On Thursday, Biden signed an executive order requiring people to wear masks in airports and on airplanes, trains and maritime vessels. He also directed agencies to use their powers, including the Defense Production Act, to accelerate production of items in short supply.

2021-01-22 12:02:06+00:00,37,"With Covid-19 vaccines now approved for use by the FDA, there’s a lot of talk — and confusion — about how this massive rollout will reach people across the country.

While it’s hopeful news, the timeline for most people receiving vaccines is weeks or months away. That’s because the process of vaccinating millions of people takes time, and the vaccine supply needs to catch up with the demand.

This happens by increasing production of approved vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, and continuing to develop other vaccine candidates. The good news is that the FDA is expecting to review two additional vaccines, produced by Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca in the coming weeks.

And even now, with more limited availability, it’s up to individual states (and sometimes counties) to decide who is eligible for the vaccine. Some processes are smoother than others. But one thing for sure is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the process, which leads to stress, and sometimes desperation. Sadly, scammers are already showing up with fake offers for “shortcuts” and are preying on people’s fears.

While it’s hard to wait, it’s also essential to recognize there’s no immediate access to a vaccine through an “alternate” route. When it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Remember, whatever the pitch you’re given, never answer personal questions, or provide information like your full Social Security number or banking information. Scammers are often looking for personal information for identity, insurance and financial theft.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, here are some scams to beware of:

Scam #1: Being asked to pay out of pocket to receive the vaccine.

The Covid-19 vaccine is free, although there can be a very small fee attached to administer the vaccine.

Scam #2: Being asked to pay to get your name on a list for a vaccine appointment, or to get early access.

There is no special list to “cut the line” to get early access. You cannot pay for immediate access to a vaccine.

Scam #3: Being asked to respond immediately for a vaccine through advertisements on social media, emails, telephone calls, or on-line access.

While it’s hopeful news, the timeline for most people receiving vaccines is weeks or months away. That’s because the process of vaccinating millions of people takes time, and the vaccine supply needs to catch up with the demand.

This happens by increasing production of approved vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, and continuing to develop other vaccine candidates. The good news is that the FDA is expecting to review two additional vaccines, produced by Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca in the coming weeks.

And even now, with more limited availability, it’s up to individual states (and sometimes counties) to decide who is eligible for the vaccine. Some processes are smoother than others. But one thing for sure is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the process, which leads to stress, and sometimes desperation. Sadly, scammers are already showing up with fake offers for “shortcuts” and are preying on people’s fears.

While it’s hard to wait, it’s also essential to recognize there’s no immediate access to a vaccine through an “alternate” route. When it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

2021-01-21 20:44:39+00:00,121,"WASHINGTON — On his second day in office, President Joe Biden signed 10 executive orders to ramp up Covid-19 vaccinations, expand testing and reopen schools as he outlined a detailed plan to tackle the pandemic.

Biden's team began warning weeks ago that they saw the outgoing administration's covid-19 vaccine plan as subpar, and since he took office on Wednesday, the new president has moved quickly to implement a new framework for getting vaccines into arms.

As part of the plan, the new administration will increase the number of vaccination sites by creating federal community vaccination centers in stadiums, gymnasiums and conference centers staffed with thousands of additional workers, some of them from federal agencies and the military, as well as first responders. Biden said there should be 100 of those centers next month.

""We didn't get into this mess overnight and it is going to take months to get it turned around,"" Biden said, warning the country will likely top 500,000 deaths next month. ""But let me be equally clear, we will get through this, we will defeat this pandemic.""

Biden's 198-page plan also looks for ways to speed vaccine production, including using the Defense Production Act, shoring up the supply chain and releasing more of the federal government's reserves. Biden encouraged all states to start vaccinating people 65 and older, along with certain essential workers, including teachers and grocery store employees.

Biden's team says the Trump administration focused solely on the distribution of the vaccine but failed to plan for actual administration, leaving the job of getting shots in arms up to state and local governments. Biden has set an ambitious goal of giving 100 million shots in 100 days — picking up the pace from the 17 million shots the Trump administration recorded in a little over a month

“What we’re inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined,” said Jeff Zients, Biden's Covid coordinator, on a call with reporters.

Administration officials think they have the supply and resources to meet the goal, but they said they will need funding from Congress to expand vaccinations to the wider population, increase testing and help schools reopen. Biden is asking for more than $400 million for the pandemic response as part of a $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

""While we will urgently execute the strategy, we do need Congress to act — and act quickly. Congress must provide the necessary funding in the Covid relief package, the American Rescue Plan, that the president will soon be sending them,"" said Zients.

Biden's new CDC director Rochelle Walensky warned that Americans shouldn't expect a vaccine timeline that was promised by the Trump administration.

In a TODAY Show interview Thursday, Walensky said the shots won't be available for the general public at retail pharmacies, like the flu vaccine is, by late February, as former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Guthrie last month.

""We are going to, as part of our plan, put the vaccine in pharmacies. Will it be in every pharmacy in this country by that timeline? I don't think so,"" Walensky said. ""I don't think late February, we're going to have vaccine in every pharmacy in this country.""

Biden also signed an executive order Thursday to require people to wear masks in airports and on airplanes, trains and maritime vessels and to mandate that international travelers have tested negative for Covid-19 before they depart for the U.S. and quarantine upon arrival.

Biden's coronavirus team said that because of a lack of information-sharing by the Trump administration during the transition, it is only beginning to get its arms around the state of the vaccination program. Officials have just begun to evaluate the supply and production schedule to figure out how much vaccine they can release while being able to ensure enough is left for people to get their second doses, Zients said.

Biden has said he wants the majority of K-8 schools to open in his first 100 days. To help make that happen, he signed a presidential memorandum Thursday reimbursing schools for additional cleaning, protective equipment and other costs associated with getting students back to the classroom using disaster relief funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It also direct his administration to develop new reopening guidelines.

Biden directed agencies to use their powers, including the Defense Production Act, to accelerate production of items in short supply, and he will direct FEMA to increase the federal reimbursement from 75 percent to 100 percent of the cost for National Guard, personnel and emergency supplies needed to create vaccination centers.

""This is a wartime undertaking,"" Biden said.

The administration said it will begin holding regular public briefings led by scientists and increase the amount of data being shared publicly, including metrics around race, the capacity of the health care system and vaccine supplies.

""The federal government should be the source of truth to the public to get clear, accessible and scientifically accurate information about Covid-19,"" Zients said. ""We will be honest, transparent and straightforward with the American people to rebuild that trust.""

Biden issued more than a dozen executive orders and memorandums in his first hours in office Wednesday, undoing many of the hallmarks of President Donald Trump's tenure and beginning to make his own mark on how the U.S. will respond to its multiple crises.

Eli Lilly: Monoclonal antibodies may prevent Covid-19 in nursing homes Drugmaker Eli Lilly announced Thursday that its monoclonal antibody therapy may lower the risk for Covid-19 by up to 80 percent in people living in nursing homes. The findings, from the clinical trial BLAZE-2, included nearly 1,000 nursing home residents and staff. Residents who received the treatment, called bamlanivimab, had up to an 80 percent lower risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 in the eight-week study period, compared with residents in the same facility who got a placebo drug, the company said. The company released few details, but said full results are forthcoming. Monoclonal antibodies, including the Lilly therapy, are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration for people with newly diagnosed Covid-19 who are at high risk for developing complications, such as those with underlying health conditions and anyone over age 65. The BLAZE-2 trial, however, aimed to look at whether monoclonal antibodies could be given prophylactically to high risk individuals to prevent disease. The trial — done in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Institutes of Health — is expected to enroll up to 5,000 people. Lilly's chief scientific officer Dr. Daniel Skovronsky said in a company press release that ""these data provide important additional clinical evidence regarding the use of bamlanivimab to fight Covid-19 and strengthen our conviction that monoclonal antibodies such as bamlanivimab can play a critical role in turning the tide of this pandemic."" Eleven people who received a placebo in the study died, four of them attributed to Covid-19. Five people who received bamlanivimab died, unrelated to the virus or the treatment. Share this -

First weekly initial jobless claims of Biden era fall to 900,000 Around 900,000 Americans filed for initial jobless claims last week, versus economists' projections of 925,000, according to the first labor market data released under President Joe Biden. First-time weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, have exceeded 750,000 a week since summer, and surged to a revised 926,000 for the week ended Jan. 9 as rising coronavirus cases continue to keep consumers home and businesses under restrictive measures. The elevated figures reflect the intensity of the damage that the virus has inflicted on the labor market — and the enormity of what Biden must now tackle.

The study said prevalence of the virus in England is “very high with no evidence of decline.” Researchers looked at 142,900 nose and throat swabs between Jan. 6 and Jan. 15. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed Britons from parts of the country to reunite with their families over Christmas. Viral spread was highest in London at 2.8 percent, more than double the figure in late November, according to the study. Share this -

First-time weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, have exceeded 750,000 a week since summer, and surged to a revised 926,000 for the week ended Jan. 9 as rising coronavirus cases continue to keep consumers home and businesses under restrictive measures.

The elevated figures reflect the intensity of the damage that the virus has inflicted on the labor market — and the enormity of what Biden must now tackle. Around 44 weeks into the pandemic, almost 16 million people continue to receive some form of unemployment assistance.

""Both the magnitude and direction of the total initial claims remain a problem, with no substantial improvement since late summer,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Millions are exhausting one unemployment program and rolling onto another in real time, underscoring that the coronavirus is still actively damaging large swaths of the economy.""

Biden last week outlined a $1.9 trillion emergency stimulus package that includes a fresh round of stimulus checks to help millions of struggling Americans pay for their home and put food on the table. His plan includes $1,400 per person in direct payments and a $400-a-week federal unemployment insurance program.

""There is real pain overwhelming the real economy,"" Biden said. ""There is no time to wait. We have to act, and act now.""

The extent of the nation's job losses ""underscores the need for an extension of aid,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.

""Many do need these funds to meet basic needs, to get caught up on bills, or to plug the gap on lost pay or hours worked while others will save the money. While inefficient to some degree, this has the ultimate benefit of boosting the broader economy and helping to lift employment or job security prospects for all,” Hamrick said.

Ultimately, bolstering the public health response ""is key to stopping the mounting labor market damage,"" Konkel said.

""Until people feel safe again, industries like hospitality and tourism cannot ramp back up. Right now, it’s a muted recovery at best. Controlling the virus is key to restoring the livelihoods of millions currently out of work,"" Konkel said.

A Covid-19 peak? Variants muddy forecasts for coming months Hospitalizations for Covid-19 in the United States are falling after having hit record levels this month — a welcome sign that the winter surge may finally be leveling off. But as new, potentially more contagious variants of the virus circulate, coronavirus modelers warn that the U.S. is by no means out of the woods yet. The emergence of new variants isn't altogether surprising, but experts say that without a better understanding of how these strains affect things like transmissibility and the effectiveness of existing vaccines, it's difficult to know how the pandemic may play out. ""There's so much up in the air, and the new variants have thrown a huge monkey wrench into our ability to model things,"" said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a professor of medicine and director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""All of those things make the crystal ball very cloudy."" Read the full story here. Share this -

As national death toll tops 50,000, Germany vows to vaccinate entire population by summer Germany passed 50,000 deaths from Covid-19 on Friday, according to the country’s disease control center. Despite infection beginning to decline in the country of 83 million people, 859 deaths in the last 24 hours were reported by the Robert Koch Institute, pushing the death toll to 50,642. This past week, the German government enforced stricter social distancing measures to tackle its second wave of the coronavirus. The government extended its national lockdown and mandated medical-grade masks in public. The new record in deaths comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised to vaccinate “every German” by the end of summer in a news conference on Thursday. Share this -

CDC: Some wiggle room in timing of second vaccination doses The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an update Thursday that people can get their second Covid-19 vaccination shots up to six weeks after they receive their first doses as the vaccines continue to be in short supply. ""The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible,"" the CDC said on its website. ""However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines may be scheduled for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose."" The slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccines — including delayed deliveries, states' receiving fewer doses than expected and difficulty scheduling appointments — has led to some consternation that people may not be able to get their second doses within the prescribed time frame of 21 or 28 days. While it's potentially worrisome, public health experts say that there's no cause for concern and that there is some wiggle room for the second dose. Read the full story. Share this -

Health experts blame rapid expansion for vaccine shortages Alarming Covid vaccine shortages across U.S. Jan. 21, 2021 01:57 Public health experts Thursday blamed Covid-19 vaccine shortages around the U.S. in part on the President Donald Trump administration’s push to get states to vastly expand their vaccination drives to reach the nation’s estimated 54 million people ages 65 and over. The push that began over a week ago has not been accompanied by enough doses to meet demand, according to state and local officials, leading to frustration and confusion and limiting states’ ability to attack the outbreak that has killed over 400,000 people in the U.S. Over the past few days, authorities in California, Ohio, West Virginia, Florida and Hawaii warned that their supplies were running out. New York City began canceling or postponing shots or stopped making new appointments because of the shortages, which President Joe Biden has vowed to turn around. Share this -

NYC first responder vaccinations suspended because of to supply concerns New York City's first responder agencies are suspending new Covid-19 vaccinations because of vaccine supply concerns, senior officials said. The New York Police Department, which vaccinated more than 12,000 members of its 54,000-member force in just nine days, suspended new first-dose vaccinations because of supply concerns Wednesday, a spokesperson said. The Fire Department of New York has vaccinated over 7,100 members of the more than 11,000-person department — which includes hard-hit emergency medical services workers. It also suspended new first-dose vaccinations Wednesday. The department said it has enough doses to cover the second doses for every member who has received a first shot to ensure that they get properly vaccinated. The supply challenge is hitting throughout the city and across the country. ""We've had to tell 23,000 New Yorkers who had an appointment this week that they will not be able to get that appointment for lack of supply,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.

1 in 4 hospitalized for Covid likely to die, L.A. county officials say One in 4 people hospitalized with Covid-19 in Los Angeles County are likely to die from the virus, public health officials revealed Wednesday. That figure doubled since the fall, when the chances of someone dying from the virus while hospitalized were about 1 in 8 between September and early November. The increased likelihood of death from the coronavirus coincides with a massive spike in cases that started at the beginning of November and has continued to batter the region. Public health officials are cautiously optimistic after seeing the number of new hospitalizations level off in recent days. Still, outcomes for new patients remain dire. From Nov. 3 to the present, each Covid-19 patient admitted to a hospital required on average two days in the intensive care unit and 9.5 days overall hospitalization, according to public health data.

Timing of second Covid vaccine dose doesn't need to be exact. Just get it, experts say.

Biden invokes Defense Production Act to accelerate vaccine rollout President Biden announced Thursday that his administration will employ the Defense Production Act to increase vaccination rollout. As part of his series of executive actions and to meet his goal to deliver 100 million shots in the first 100 days of his presidency, Biden pledged to shore up the supply chain and devote more of the federal government's reserves to the effort. Biden encouraged agencies to look to the Defense Production Act to accelerate production, hoping to combat short supply as states are already reporting they are running out of vaccine doses. Former President Donald Trump previously invoked the Defense Production Act to speed the production of medical supplies and components to test for Covid-19. BREAKING: Pres.

Biden Covid plan includes efforts to fight disinformation The Biden administration's Covid-19 plan released Thursday includes efforts to re-establish trust with the American public and fight disinformation, which public health experts have labeled a major problem facing the U.S. response. ""The Administration will lead world-class public education campaigns — covering topics like masking, testing, vaccinations and vaccine hesitancy — designed with diversity and inclusivity in mind, including communications in multiple languages, to maximize reach and effectiveness,"" the administration wrote in the plan. ""The campaigns will be coordinated, across national, state, and local levels, and engage with the private and public sector. They will be anchored by science and fact-based public health guidance. The Administration will work to counter misinformation and disinformation by ensuring that Americans are obtaining science-based information."" The plan lays out four ways to accomplish that: Encourage engagement to support the campaign; identify and address misinformation; address vaccine hesitancy especially in hard-to-reach communities; and provide clear information on how people can get vaccinated. The plan does not touch on whether it plans to work with major internet platforms that are often the way Covid-19 misinformation reaches mass audiences. Share this -

In response to Cuomo, Pfizer says it can't sell vaccines to states without fed approval New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday asked Pfizer chief Albert Bourla whether the state could purchase Covid-19 vaccine doses directly from the pharmaceutical giant. In response, Pfizer said the Biden administration's Health and Human Services Department would need to sign off before the company can sell vaccines directly to states. ""We appreciate Governor Cuomo’s kind words and the pride he expressed in his letter that Pfizer is a New York-headquartered company,"" the company said this week. ""Pfizer is open to collaborating with HHS on a distribution model that gives as many Americans as possible access to our vaccine as quickly as possible. ""However, before we can sell directly to State governments, HHS would need to approve that proposal based on the [Emergency Use Authorization] granted to Pfizer by the FDA.” Meanwhile, NYC announced today that it is rescheduling all vaccine appointments from Thursday to Sunday for next week while it deals with vaccine shortages.

'We need more': Cities and hospitals feel pinch of Covid-19 vaccine shortages The U.S. vaccine rollout hasn't been perfect, but states and cities have worked to ramp up distribution and make sure vaccines don't expire. Now, they're worried the distribution could get ahead of the supply. Some health care providers and cities say they are running out of doses within a few days of getting their weekly allocation, a change from a couple weeks ago when local vaccinators had trouble keeping up with the supplies they were getting. Covid-19 vaccines were always going to be in short supply after receiving U.S. approval for emergency use only last month, but patients, hospitals and local officials say even the meager allocation has been unpredictable. San Francisco said this week that the supply its city health department received Tuesday could be gone by the end of Thursday, while New York City warned that its weekly supply also may not last into the weekend.

Eli Lilly: Monoclonal antibodies may prevent Covid-19 in nursing homes Drugmaker Eli Lilly announced Thursday that its monoclonal antibody therapy may lower the risk for Covid-19 by up to 80 percent in people living in nursing homes. The findings, from the clinical trial BLAZE-2, included nearly 1,000 nursing home residents and staff. Residents who received the treatment, called bamlanivimab, had up to an 80 percent lower risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 in the eight-week study period, compared with residents in the same facility who got a placebo drug, the company said. The company released few details, but said full results are forthcoming. Monoclonal antibodies, including the Lilly therapy, are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration for people with newly diagnosed Covid-19 who are at high risk for developing complications, such as those with underlying health conditions and anyone over age 65. The BLAZE-2 trial, however, aimed to look at whether monoclonal antibodies could be given prophylactically to high risk individuals to prevent disease. The trial — done in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Institutes of Health — is expected to enroll up to 5,000 people. Lilly's chief scientific officer Dr. Daniel Skovronsky said in a company press release that ""these data provide important additional clinical evidence regarding the use of bamlanivimab to fight Covid-19 and strengthen our conviction that monoclonal antibodies such as bamlanivimab can play a critical role in turning the tide of this pandemic."" Eleven people who received a placebo in the study died, four of them attributed to Covid-19. Five people who received bamlanivimab died, unrelated to the virus or the treatment. Share this -

First weekly initial jobless claims of Biden era fall to 900,000 Around 900,000 Americans filed for initial jobless claims last week, versus economists' projections of 925,000, according to the first labor market data released under President Joe Biden. First-time weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, have exceeded 750,000 a week since summer, and surged to a revised 926,000 for the week ended Jan. 9 as rising coronavirus cases continue to keep consumers home and businesses under restrictive measures. The elevated figures reflect the intensity of the damage that the virus has inflicted on the labor market — and the enormity of what Biden must now tackle. Around 44 weeks into the pandemic, almost 16 million people continue to receive some form of unemployment assistance. ""There is real pain overwhelming the real economy,"" Biden said.

Biden outlines ambitious pandemic response on 2nd day in office WASHINGTON — On his second day in office, President Joe Biden has revealed plans to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic by creating federal community vaccination centers in stadiums, gymnasiums and conference centers staffed with thousands of additional workers, some of them from federal agencies and the military, as well as first responders. Biden's plan also looks for ways to speed vaccine production, including using the Defense Production Act, shoring up the supply chain and releasing more of the federal government's reserves. Biden will encourage all states to start vaccinating people 65 and older, along with certain essential workers, including teachers and grocery store employees. Biden has set an ambitious goal of giving 100 million shots in 100 days — picking up the pace from the 17 million shots the Trump administration recorded in a little over a month. Administration officials think they have the supply and resources to meet the goal, but they said they will need funding from Congress to expand vaccinations to the wider population, increase testing and help schools reopen. Biden is asking for more than $400 million for the pandemic response as part of a $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Read the full story here. Share this -

British scientists fear viral transmissions are not declining, despite national lockdown England’s latest national lockdown has not reduced the spread of the coronavirus, according to a study conducted by Imperial College London, as the U.K.'s Covid-19 death toll rose to a record 1,820 on Wednesday. The study said prevalence of the virus in England is “very high with no evidence of decline.” Researchers looked at 142,900 nose and throat swabs between Jan. 6 and Jan. 15. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed Britons from parts of the country to reunite with their families over Christmas. Viral spread was highest in London at 2.8 percent, more than double the figure in late November, according to the study. Share this -

2021-01-19 22:31:07+00:00,50,"More than 400,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the United States, according to an NBC News tally early Tuesday, a milestone that seemed unimaginable at the start of the pandemic a year ago.

More than 2 million people have been recorded killed by the virus worldwide, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. death toll is the world's highest, even though the country has less than 5 percent of the world's population.

As of early Tuesday, there have been 400,103 U.S. deaths from Covid-19, according to NBC News' count. That is nearly equal to the number of American military casualties in World War II, which stands at around 405,000, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The U.S. confirmed its first case of the virus in Seattle on Jan. 21, 2020.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Nearly a year later, 24 million people have been infected in the U.S., the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. California on Monday became the first state to reach 3 million cases, and Los Angeles county crossed the 1 million case mark over the weekend, according to the NBC News tally.

The number of those killed is much higher than expected at the pandemic's outset.

More than 2 million people have been recorded killed by the virus worldwide, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. death toll is the world's highest, even though the country has less than 5 percent of the world's population.

As of early Tuesday, there have been 400,103 U.S. deaths from Covid-19, according to NBC News' count. That is nearly equal to the number of American military casualties in World War II, which stands at around 405,000, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The U.S. confirmed its first case of the virus in Seattle on Jan. 21, 2020.

Nearly a year later, 24 million people have been infected in the U.S., the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. California on Monday became the first state to reach 3 million cases, and Los Angeles county crossed the 1 million case mark over the weekend, according to the NBC News tally.

The number of those killed is much higher than expected at the pandemic's outset.

2021-01-19 06:30:06+00:00,118,"President Donald Trump said Monday that he is ending Covid-19 travel restrictions for air travelers from Europe and Brazil, a move the incoming administration quickly rejected.

In a proclamation, Trump said the restrictions would be lifted Jan. 26, the same day a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order requiring negative tests for air travelers coming to the U.S. takes effect.

But by then, Joe Biden will be president, and his press secretary tweeted that the restrictions would remain in place.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,"" said Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki. ""... In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.""

On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19. — Jen Psaki (@jrpsaki) January 19, 2021

The travel restrictions put in place last year prevented most people without U.S. citizenship or residency from traveling to the U.S. from the affected regions.

Trump's proclamation said the restrictions would be lifted for Europe and Brazil because the U.S. is confident that they will comply with an order requiring negative tests for those traveling by air to the U.S.

It leaves restrictions in place for China and Iran.

The CDC this month announced that starting Jan. 26, all air passengers from other countries would be required to test negative before coming to the U.S.

If the restrictions are lifted as in Trump's proclamation, travelers from the United Kingdom, the Schengen Area in Europe, Ireland and Brazil would still have to test negative.

But the current restrictions that bar non-U.S. citizens who have been to those countries within the last 14 days would be lifted, a White House official said.

Trump said he was leaving the restrictions in place for China and Iran in part because ""their lack of cooperation with the United States thus far in combatting the pandemic, cast doubt on their cooperation"" with the testing order.

The CDC in late December said all air travelers from the U.K. would be required to test negative before departing to the U.S. after a variant was discovered in the country that is believed to be more transmissible. It said Jan. 12 that the requirement would be expanded to include air passengers entering the U.S., effective Jan. 26.

The variant discovered in the U.K. had been detected in at least 10 states as of Wednesday, according to a CDC report last week. It is thought to be more transmissible but not any more deadly.

More than 2 million people around the world have died of Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases. The 2 million mark was passed Friday.

2021-01-18 23:36:16+00:00,121,"Aiming to boost the slow pace of administering Covid-19 vaccinations, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday that the state has turned to Starbucks for help streamlining logistics and setting a new goal to dole out 45,000 doses a day.

Starbucks has assigned 11 employees with expertise in labor and deployment, operations, and research and development to work full time on vaccine distribution in its home state, the company said, adding that the number of employees could change.

Inslee said the state is also arranging for over 2,000 pharmacies to administer vaccinations and setting up drive-by vaccination sites. Microsoft, another Seattle area-based corporation, will also set up a site to perform 5,000 vaccinations a day, he said.

""This is a unique challenge for the United States and in every state to stand up a total mobilization of our resources,"" Inslee said. ""We did that in World War II when we built the Liberty ships here in Washington state. We reached production levels that no one could imagine because we set ambitious goals.""

The two vaccines approved for use in the United States, which require two shots, are remarkably effective, but the rollout nationwide has been slow since they started going out one month ago. Nationwide, 12.2 million people have received one dose of one of the vaccines, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and just 1.6 million have received both doses, among a total population of 330.8 million Americans. The Trump administration had promised to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020.

""We can't think that's an acceptable pace,"" Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said. ""So we have to dramatically scale this up and accelerate the progress.""

Inslee, a Democrat, said that the state underestimated how difficult it would be to vaccinate all health care workers quickly before moving on to other populations and that fewer people signed up for vaccinations than it expected.

""We're having the same challenges that every state has had, because we started on the more difficult part of this — which is a fairly select small group, which is health care workers,"" he said. ""And in order to identify them and vector them into the sites — that has been a slower part of the process. Now we will start today to open up this to people of age over 65. It is much easier to communicate and coordinate that group to get them in.""

Starbucks started discussions with the state earlier this month. Just 31,581 people have received both doses in Washington, which has a population of 7.6 million, according to CDC data. This week, the state began allowing people over age 65 to get vaccinated.

The Starbucks employees assigned to work on vaccine distribution will use the company's computer simulation modeling system to find ways to expedite inoculations, according to the state and the company. Starbucks and Washington hope the partnership will create an improved vaccine distribution network across the state's 39 counties and 29 tribal nations.

President-elect Joe Biden said last week that he would deploy the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Guard to help set up vaccination clinics across the country to meet a goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days of his term.

Several states have started working with large pharmacy chains to expand distribution of vaccines to health care workers. West Virginia has vaccinated more residents per capita than any other state by working with small, independent pharmacies instead of the big chains.

Several Democratic governors, including Inslee, said last week that the Trump administration had misled them about whether a national stockpile of vaccines was being held for second doses. Inslee said the federal government told governors that there was a strategic reserve.

Inslee said he has plenty of trust that the Biden administration will do a better job distributing vaccines to the states.

""I'm confident we're going to have a much better relationship, that the federal government is not going to consciously deceive us like the last administration did,"" he said. ""And so I feel very good about our federal partnership moving forward.""

2021-01-18 23:01:06+00:00,139,"A hospital Covid-19 vaccination team shows up at the emergency room to inoculate employees who haven’t received their shots.

Finding just a few, the team is about to leave when an ER doctor suggests they give the remaining doses to vulnerable patients or nonhospital employees. The team refuses, saying that would violate hospital policy and state guidelines.

Incensed, the doctor works his way up the hospital chain of command until he finds an administrator who gives the OK for the team to use up the rest of the doses.

But by the time the doctor tracks down the medical team, its shift is over and, following protocol, whatever doses remained are now in the garbage.

Isolated incident? Not a chance, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told NBC News.

“This kind of thing is pretty rampant,” Jha said. “I have personally heard stories like this from dozens of physician friends in a variety of different states. Hundreds, if not thousands, of doses are getting tossed across the country every day. It’s unbelievable.”

Jha said the ER doctor whose story he laid out in a Twitter thread this week asked to not be identified, but his story, seen by thousands of people, resonated with other medical professionals frustrated by rules and regulations that they say are making it harder to get more Americans vaccinated.

Why is this happening? Covid-19 vaccines have a short shelf life once they are thawed out for use, Jha said. And because of federal and state mandates, hospitals and other health care providers would rather risk a dose going bad than give it to somebody who isn't scheduled to get a shot.

At the same time, states like Massachusetts now have rules requiring hospitals to report the number of vaccine doses that have been discarded, Jha said.

“The problem is that hospitals that do report this get pilloried in the press for wasting vaccines,” Jha said. “So, many hospitals are not reporting and this is happening across the country.”

While there doesn’t appear to be any solid numbers yet of how many of the Covid-19 vaccines have been discarded in the United States since the rollout began last month, the World Health Organization warned in 2005 that up to 50 percent of the vaccines released globally each year end up in the dumpster because of supply chain problems, such as not having enough freezer space or transportation issues.

Some of those same problem have dogged the Trump administration’s efforts to roll out the Covid-19 vaccines.

“I hope (and pray) it is not as high as 50 percent, given the thousands of people that are dying every day,” said Dr. Sadiya Khan, an epidemiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “While it is an inevitable reality that a proportion of doses may be wasted, it will take careful planning and oversight to minimize waste.”

Infectious disease expert Dr. John Swartzberg agreed.

“I have not seen any data about how much vaccine has been wasted (besides what I read in the newspapers),” said Swartzberg, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. “Given how needed it is, I hope the WHO data is incorrect.”

For Sue Joss, the CEO of the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center in Brockton, Massachusetts, one wasted dose of Covid-19 vaccine is one too many.

It was Christmas Eve, she said, and a staffer scheduled to receive that last remaining shot of the 60 Moderna vaccines that had been removed from cold storage that day did not show up.

“We can’t let this happen again,” Joss recalled saying before the unclaimed dose was trashed.

So, Joss put into place a system to ensure that if somebody fails to show up for an appointment, there is another person ready and waiting to take his or her place. “We now have a waiting list of people who can come in on short notice to get a shot,” she said.

But that’s not foolproof either, Joss added.

“One time last week, we went marching through the halls to find a patient willing to get a shot, so a dose wouldn’t go to waste,” she said.

Similar stories of unused doses landing in the garbage have been reported elsewhere in the country.

Dozens of doses earmarked for two hospitals in Portland, Oregon, were thrown away when officials couldn’t round up enough health care workers to get the shots before the vaccines expired.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo loosened rules designed to ensure that the first shots went to front-line health care workers and retirement home residents – and that less endangered people did not cut in line – following reports that unused vaccines were being thrown away.

And in Ohio, three dozen doses landed in the garbage after a nursing home in Lawrence County overestimated the number of vaccines it needed, forcing the pharmacists administering the shots to search for takers.

“They did everything they could,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said. “They got everyone who would take a shot but they had some leftover, a lot of leftover.”

President Donald Trump, whose erratic leadership during the pandemic helped doom his re-election bid, had vowed that 20 million people in the U.S. would be immunized by the end of 2020.

But as of Thursday, 30.6 million doses of coronavirus vaccine had been distributed with just 11.1 million people receiving their first shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination tracker.

The massive coronavirus vaccine rollout in the U.S. has been hobbled by poor planning, a distribution system that relies largely on state and local governments to make those calls, and by well-meaning attempts at limiting the distribution of the first doses to the most vulnerable populations that have backfired.

Infectious disease expert Dr. John Swartzberg agreed.

“I have not seen any data about how much vaccine has been wasted (besides what I read in the newspapers),” said Swartzberg, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. “Given how needed it is, I hope the WHO data is incorrect.”

For Sue Joss, the CEO of the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center in Brockton, Massachusetts, one wasted dose of Covid-19 vaccine is one too many.

It was Christmas Eve, she said, and a staffer scheduled to receive that last remaining shot of the 60 Moderna vaccines that had been removed from cold storage that day did not show up.

“We can’t let this happen again,” Joss recalled saying before the unclaimed dose was trashed.

So, Joss put into place a system to ensure that if somebody fails to show up for an appointment, there is another person ready and waiting to take his or her place. “We now have a waiting list of people who can come in on short notice to get a shot,” she said.

But that’s not foolproof either, Joss added.

“One time last week, we went marching through the halls to find a patient willing to get a shot, so a dose wouldn’t go to waste,” she said.

Similar stories of unused doses landing in the garbage have been reported elsewhere in the country.

Dozens of doses earmarked for two hospitals in Portland, Oregon, were thrown away when officials couldn’t round up enough health care workers to get the shots before the vaccines expired.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo loosened rules designed to ensure that the first shots went to front-line health care workers and retirement home residents – and that less endangered people did not cut in line – following reports that unused vaccines were being thrown away.

And in Ohio, three dozen doses landed in the garbage after a nursing home in Lawrence County overestimated the number of vaccines it needed, forcing the pharmacists administering the shots to search for takers.

“They did everything they could,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said. “They got everyone who would take a shot but they had some leftover, a lot of leftover.”

President Donald Trump, whose erratic leadership during the pandemic helped doom his re-election bid, had vowed that 20 million people in the U.S. would be immunized by the end of 2020.

But as of Thursday, 30.6 million doses of coronavirus vaccine had been distributed with just 11.1 million people receiving their first shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination tracker.

The massive coronavirus vaccine rollout in the U.S. has been hobbled by poor planning, a distribution system that relies largely on state and local governments to make those calls, and by well-meaning attempts at limiting the distribution of the first doses to the most vulnerable populations that have backfired.

2021-01-17 17:32:07+00:00,75,"LOS ANGELES — Twice a week, Ismelda Reyes leaves the home she shares with her husband, adult daughter and 93-year-old mother to clean rooms at a tony Santa Monica hotel across the city.

She takes her own mask to work, just one for the whole day, and does not receive a temperature check or any other kind of health screening. Reyes, an immigrant from El Salvador, said she often comes in close contact with co-workers in elevators or inside the laundry room.

In the lobby and in hallways, she sometimes encounters guests who are not wearing masks even as she sweats through her own.

""I am scared because of what you hear on the news with so many people dying,"" she said in Spanish. ""There is always that concern that I can get it at work.""

With its sandy beaches and year-round sunshine, Los Angeles conjures up images of celebrities and tanned residents comfortably scattered in a sprawl of roomy single-family homes.

But the popular images of L.A. belie the reality for millions of residents, many of whom are considered essential and live in dense or multigenerational housing at a time when public health officials recommend working from home and maintaining social distance.

On Saturday, Los Angeles became the first county in the nation to surpass 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases. Public health officials also confirmed at least one case of the new U.K. variant of the coronavirus in a man who spent time in L.A. and is now quarantining in Oregon.

Los Angeles County has now recorded at least 1,003,923 coronavirus infections and 13,741 deaths, public health officials said. California has more than 2.9 million confirmed cases and roughly 33,000 deaths, according to NBC News counts.

In a county of 10 million residents, the coronavirus pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on Latinos, who comprise 40 percent of the state's population but 55 percent of all confirmed Covid-19 cases and 46.5 percent of all deaths, according to state public health data.

Death rates among Latinos in L.A. are twice as high as in the rest of the population, according to Los Angeles County public health officials. And Latinos, who are about half of all county residents, are hospitalized three times more often than white people.

""As cases surge, it's very clear and very alarming that certain groups are, once again, bearing the greater burden of illness than others,"" the county's public health director, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, said Wednesday during her daily briefing. ""The surge shows what happens as the gaps widen between the people living in the highest-resource areas and those in the lowest-resource areas.""

Despite a regional stay-at-home order, Reyes must report to work every week to maintain health insurance and pay her mortgage, she said. She worries about infecting her mother and what could happen to the family if she or her husband got too sick to work.

""I've lived here 34 years. I've given more to this country than to my home country,"" she said. ""More than anything, I want [local] leaders to see the plight we're in.""

Kurt Petersen, co-president of Unite Here Local 11, a union that represents hotel and food service workers in Los Angeles, said it is ""a false choice"" for people like Reyes, who is a member of the union.

""They're caught in this horrible decision of 'Do I go to work and risk infection, or do I stay home and risk eviction?'"" he said.

Of the union's roughly 30,000 members, about 70 percent are Latino, Petersen said. Since December, Unite Here has lost one member a week to Covid-19 on average. All of those who died were Latino, he said, which closely mirrors what the county is experiencing overall during the deadly winter surge.

Since early November, when the surge started, the death rate among Latino residents in L.A. increased by more than 800 percent, from 3.5 deaths per 100,000 residents a day to 28 deaths per 100,000 residents a day, according to public health officials. Over the same period, the death rate among Black residents increased from less than 1 per 100,000 people a day to more than 15 per 100,000 people.

Deaths also have increased among Asian residents, from 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people in early November to 12 deaths per 100,000 people. White residents are now at 10 deaths per 100,000 people, according to county public health data.

""You have the combination of poverty and density, and that leads to rapid spread of the virus,"" said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an infectious disease expert and professor of epidemiology at UCLA. ""It's hard to stop the momentum once it's started.""

The problem is particularly acute in Latino and Black neighborhoods, where residents face the highest burden of sheltering in place during the pandemic. According to a study by the Latino Policy & Politics Initiative at UCLA, 40 percent of Black and Latino residents live in neighborhoods with high density, lack of green space and few grocery stores.

The environmental disparities also extend to workplace inequities. In the L.A. region, more than 50 percent of essential workers are Latino, according to the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation. They work in low-paying jobs that do not always include health care coverage or paid sick leave.

""People go to work not to be heroes but because they need money to exist,"" said Sonja Diaz, director of the Latino Policy & Politics Initiative. ""They're more likely to live in communities that are not resilient to overcoming or surviving a pandemic.""

In a county where researchers estimate that 1 in 3 residents has been infected with the coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic, workplace dangers remain high. Public health officials are investigating more than 500 workplace outbreaks, some of them at highly frequented businesses such as Target, Whole Foods and Costco, the county announced Wednesday.

Because infection rates remain rampant, health officials this week recommended that essential workers and people who run errands wear masks inside their own homes.

""It would be better if people got enough money to stay in their home, pay their rent and feel safe,"" Petersen said. ""If we gave people the ability to stay home, we could get through this spike.""

William, a construction foreman in Los Angeles who asked that NBC News not use his last name for fear of retribution, would prefer to follow regional stay-at-home orders, but he continues to report to work daily. He and his wife, who is unemployed, have two teenage daughters and rent to pay.

While William wears a mask to work every day, he often has to enter apartments and houses where people are living. Not all of them wear masks, he said. To keep distance between himself and others, he posts yellow tape to encourage people to stay away, but ""they don't care,"" he said.

Since the start of the pandemic, William has lost three friends to Covid-19. One of his adult sons also contracted the virus and survived. He feels lucky to have avoided getting sick, but he recently learned that one of his co-workers had been exposed, and now his entire team is waiting on test results.

""I would rather stay home,"" William said. ""The problem is that I don't have enough money to keep me at home. I have bills to pay.""",MSNBC,"['los', 'deaths', 'health', 'officials', 'hardhit', 'surge', 'latinos', 'work', 'covids', 'widen', 'county', 'public', 'gaps', 'la', 'bear', 'residents', 'latino', 'angeles', 'brunt']",0

2021-01-17 01:01:02+00:00,57,"When my mom moved down to Florida a few years ago, my entire family was marveling at her ability to regroup after losing her husband of 64 years, two heart attacks and a diagnosis of Parkinson’s. There is no doubt that her passion for her art and the constant search for the next tree trunk to sculpt played a huge role in her ability to pivot. We spent a year moving her massive pieces of art to Florida, along with all her tools. We also visited many museums that were keen on showing her work. She had a life that I could support, with my mom pretty much in the driver’s seat.

But everything changed with Covid-19. Our regular lives stopped short, and it was extremely traumatizing for my mom. She began to tell me she did not have time for Covid-19, noting that she, at 88, “was literally running out of time.” I had to hold myself together upon hearing this. It was a moment I realized I needed to do more to support my mom. Much more. And it has not been easy.

Bottom line—it's an absolutely frightening time to be caring for an aging parent.

You’re often barred from visiting them if they live in a facility. You may struggle to find willing aides if they’re living at home. You’re likely worried about their physical and mental health. And above all else, you’re terrified that in helping your loved one, you might expose them to the potentially deadly coronavirus.

I know this firsthand as the primary caregiver to my mom, who everyone lovingly calls, “Bamba.”

Just a year ago, we were planning a huge opening at the Boca Raton Museum of Art. Then after that it would be on to Miami at the Lowe Art Museum. As a sculptor, many of her days back then were spent in the studio, with a chainsaw in hand, preparing her signature, massive wood sculptures. She would also come to my house to swim for her daily exercise, see her grandchildren and visit with our pets. We’d all share a meal together.

No longer.

Like many Americans, Bamba, who also suffers from a bit of dementia, had to completely change her lifestyle due to Covid-19. She lives in what I call “the Bamba Bubble.” I’ve had to find a new approach to helping care of my mom to ensure she stays safe until she gets the vaccine—which I hope will be soon. We keep calling trying to find one for her.

It’s been hard and scary for her, and as each month ticks by, it’s become more challenging and it has impacted her health dramatically. In fact, just a few weeks ago, Bamba became dehydrated and fainted. We rushed her to the closest hospital, which was overrun with Covid-19 patients. Because the hospital was so full, they took her from me and slammed the door, leaving me outside. She had to sit in a cold room by herself for 10 hours. I was beside myself, knowing that she would grow increasingly confused.

Doctors would call me as I waited in the parking lot. They couldn’t find anything wrong except her sodium levels were off and as a result, they would need to keep her overnight. I was terrified for her. I begged for hours to come in and stay with her. They finally relented, and I was able to stay with her for the night if we stayed in the room with the door closed. The next morning, it was discovered that machine that checked her sodium levels was broken and that my mom’s numbers were fine! It was frustrating, and it took Bamba nearly two weeks to bounce back from the incident, which we still don’t know the cause of.

But I learned something from that day ― that my mom has a lot of strength and fight in her. She dug deep and persevered, at one point giving me the thumbs up, trying to make me feel better. She was very concerned about whether I had socks on and enough blankets as we settled down for the night locked in a room in a hospital filled with Covid-19 patients. We did our face creams together, and we did our best to keep a good mood going and got through the long night together.

Much of my day now is spent with my mom and just trying to keep her healthy. She needs my company to feel normal during these extraordinarily abnormal times. I moved everything inside the “Bamba Bubble.”

Her garage is a gym, with a bench, light weights and a stability ball. Since she can’t come to my house to swim anymore (it’s just too risky with kids in our house), I go to her and we lift weights together a few times a week, even just for five minutes at a time.

We’ve also turned her patio into what I call the “Bamba jungle.” She loves gardening and trees, so I literally brought them to her. The patio is now stuffed with all sorts of plants and trees that touch the ceiling and are growing across the screened roof. It’s where she spends most of her time now with my dad’s dog Daisy. It’s an oasis of calm in our chaotic world. We love it.

No matter what, I make sure she gets outside every day. It might be biking alongside me, walking Daisy, or with my daughter who is currently living at home. It might just be a few minutes outside, or a lot longer. But the fresh air does wonders to lift her spirits and mine.

I even get her out on my little, very tippy boat. The wind keeps the air fresh so it’s becoming an afternoon ritual. I drive it so slow, about three miles an hour, but it’s something to do. I also bring our animals, both the big ones and small ones, over to her. Bamba immediately starts laughing and smiling at the sight of one of our pets.

My advice if you’re taking care of an aging parent, keep it simple. Pets, walks, an herb garden, crafts. Whenever you have time, engage. It doesn’t matter if it’s in-person, on FaceTime, or on the phone. It’s a very lonely time for many of our elderly parents, so percolate their lives with your voice and joy.

Call often, even if they don’t remember it. Talk about family and the fun things that grandchildren are doing, and its OK if you repeat yourself. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming, and one might want to put those calls off. DON’T. Make it a routine to check in. And when you do, dig deep on positive topics.

There’s no need to weigh them down with the gravity of the situation, talking about the news or the daily death toll. Focus on the positive and overlook the negative. Talk about what’s in their power to enjoy.

Now, Bamba and I talk about art, her grandchildren, exercise, and our animals, which have brought us an enormous amount of joy and distraction during these uncertain times.

I am among the blessed. I am lucky to be close to my mom to see her in person. I am lucky to be able to be a personal part of her daily life, and I am grateful every day for this. Every time I want to complain, even for a second, I say it out loud: We are blessed. We just have to take it day by day to get through this difficult time. Eventually, the pandemic fog will lift.

2021-01-16 22:49:04+00:00,122,"Los Angeles on Saturday became the first county in the nation to record 1 million coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic.

Public health officials also confirmed at least one case of the new U.K. variant of Covid-19 in a man who spent time in L.A. and is now quarantining in Oregon. Officials believe the variant is already spreading in the community and are continuing to test samples.

“The presence of the U.K. variant in Los Angeles County is troubling, as our healthcare system is already severely strained with more than 7,500 people currently hospitalized,"" said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, L.A. county's public health director, in a statement. ""Our community is bearing the brunt of the winter surge, experiencing huge numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, five-times what we experienced over the summer.""

On Saturday, Los Angeles reported 1,003,923 confirmed Covid-19 infections and 13,741 deaths. Public health officials warned earlier this week that the actual number of coronavirus cases could be much higher, saying that as many as 1 in 3 residents have been infected since the pandemic began last year.

The state of California is also reporting staggering numbers with more than 2.9 million confirmed cases, according to NBC News counts. Texas, with 2 million cases, and Florida, with 1.5 million, are the next two states with the most infections. New York, which was one of the country’s first and biggest hot spots, has recorded 1.2 million cases to date.

Ferrer said this week that officials would consider tightening restrictions for businesses, schools and even youth leagues if the current winter surge continues to escalate.

""The work ahead requires us to take every action necessary to reduce transmission,” she warned.

Public health officials are especially concerned that a more contagious variant of the coronavirus could become the dominant strain by March, matching a report released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The variant has already been detected in neighboring San Bernardino County and San Diego.

Current evidence does not suggest the variant will make people sicker. But its faster spread will lead to more cases overall, the study authors wrote, ""exacerbating the burden on an already strained health care system, and resulting in more deaths.""

According to Los Angeles County public health officials, the current Covid-19 surge started in early November shortly after they loosened restrictions on businesses and in-person gatherings. Since then, rates have increased by 1,000 percent and have disproportionately affected Latinos, who comprise roughly half of the total population.

Experts have pointed to high-density and multigenerational living in Los Angeles’ hardest hit neighborhoods as risk factors, plus a large essential workforce that must report to work in person rather than staying home.

The high Covid-19 rates are being compounded by a slow rollout of vaccinations in a county of 10 million residents. As of Thursday, roughly 279,000 doses have been administered to health care workers and residents and staff at skilled nursing facilities, according to public health officials. But the county must vaccinate an additional 450,000 health care workers before other groups, including people over the age of 65, can receive their vaccinations.

""We are very hopeful that our allocation of doses increases enough for us to begin vaccinating seniors before the end of the month,” Ferrer said in a statement. “As vaccine supply improves, more residents will become eligible for vaccinations. It will take a number of months to reach the level of vaccination needed in the population to curb ongoing transmission of the virus.""",MSNBC,"['variant', 'covid19', 'los', 'hit', 'health', 'county', 'cases', 'officials', 'residents', 'million', 'angeles']",0

2021-01-16 21:01:01+00:00,34,"TERRE HAUTE, Ind. — The U.S. government executed a drug trafficker Thursday for his involvement in a series of slayings in Virginia’s capital city in 1992, despite claims by his lawyers that the lethal injection would cause excruciating pain due to lung damage from his recent Covid-19 infection.

Corey Johnson, 52, was the 12th inmate put to death at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, since the Trump administration restarted federal executions following a 17-year hiatus.

He was pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m.

Johnson’s execution and Friday’s scheduled execution of Dustin Higgs are the last before next week’s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who opposes the federal death penalty and has signaled he’ll end its use. Both inmates contracted Covid-19 and won temporary stays of execution this week for that reason, only for higher courts to allow the lethal injections to move forward.

Lawyers have previously argued the lethal injections of pentobarbital caused flash pulmonary edema, where fluid rapidly fills the lungs, sparking sensations akin to drowning. The new claim was that fluid would rush into the inmates’ Covid-damaged lungs immediately while they were still conscious.

Johnson was implicated in one of the worst bursts of gang violence Richmond had ever seen, with 11 people killed in a 45-day period. He and two other members of the Newtowne gang were sentenced to death under a federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers.

In their clemency petition, Johnson’s lawyers asked President Donald Trump to commute his death sentence to life in prison. They described a traumatic childhood in which he was physically abused by his drug-addicted mother and her boyfriends, abandoned at age 13, then shuffled between residential and institutional facilities until he aged out of the foster care system. They cited numerous childhood IQ tests discovered after he was sentenced that place him in the mentally disabled category and say testing during his time in prison shows he can read and write at only an elementary school level.

In a final statement, Johnson said he was “sorry for my crimes” and said he wanted the victims to be remembered. He said the pizza and strawberry shake he ate and drank before the execution “were wonderful” but he didn’t get the doughnuts he wanted. He also thanked his minister and lawyer.

“I am okay,” he said. “I am at peace.”

In a statement, Johnson’s lawyers said the government executed a person “with an intellectual disability, in stark violation of the Constitution and federal law” and vehemently denied he had the mental capacity to be a so-called drug kingpin.

“The government’s arbitrary rush to execute Mr. Johnson, who was categorically ineligible for execution due to his significant impairments, rested on procedural technicalities rather than any serious dispute that he was intellectually disabled,” the attorneys, Donald Salzman and Ronald Tabak, said.

Government filings have spelled Johnson’s name “Cory,” but his lawyers say he spells it “Corey.”

Richard Benedict, who was Johnson’s special education teacher at a New York school for emotionally troubled kids, said Johnson was hyperactive, anxious and reading and writing at a second- or third-grade level when he was 16 and 17.

“I had to have someone walk him to the bathroom because he just couldn’t get back to the classroom,” Benedict said.

Prosecutors, however, said Johnson had not shown that he was mentally disabled.

“While rejecting that he has intellectual disabilities that preclude his death sentences, courts have repeatedly and correctly concluded that Johnson’s seven murders were planned to advance his drug trafficking and were not impulsive acts by someone incapable of capable making calculated judgments, and are therefore eligible for the death penalty,” prosecutors argue in court documents.

A defense psychologist testified during the trial that Johnson’s IQ was measured at 77, above the threshold score of 75 then needed to label someone as intellectually disabled. Johnson’s appellate lawyers say that psychologist was not an expert in intellectual disability and relied on standards that are now outdated.

C.T. Woody Jr., the lead homicide detective on the case, said that during his interrogations of Johnson, he denied any involvement in the killings and said police were trying to frame him because of lies people were telling about him.

“It did not seem to me that he had any kind of mental problems at all except his viciousness and no respect for human life — none whatsoever,” Woody said.

Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Vick Jr., one of the prosecutors in the case, said the violence committed by Johnson and his fellow gang members was unmatched at the time. One of the gang’s victims was stabbed 85 times and another was shot 16 times. Johnson was convicted of being the shooter in a triple slaying, and participating in four other capital murders, including shooting a rival drug dealer 15 times.

“The heinousness of the crimes, the utter senselessness of the crimes, the crimes themselves warranted the seeking of the death penalty this case,” Vick said.

In his clemency petition, Johnson’s lawyers said he has repeatedly expressed “sincere remorse” for his crimes.

“I’m sorry for the great number of people who are dead, you know, and there is a lot on us, and I feel we are no angels,” he said during his sentencing hearing. He also spoke to a group of students present in the courtroom that day and urged them not to commit crimes or make the mistakes he had made in his life.",MSNBC,"['killer', 'johnson', 'execution', 'gang', 'johnsons', 'crimes', 'federal', 'lawyers', 'death', 'say', 'terre', 'executed', 'despite', 'virginia', 'infection', 'drug', 'covid']",0
2021-01-16 12:32:03+00:00,174,"A hospital Covid-19 vaccination team shows up at the emergency room to inoculate employees who haven’t received their shots.

Finding just a few, the team is about to leave when an ER doctor suggests they give the remaining doses to vulnerable patients or nonhospital employees. The team refuses, saying that would violate hospital policy and state guidelines.

Incensed, the doctor works his way up the hospital chain of command until he finds an administrator who gives the OK for the team to use up the rest of the doses.

But by the time the doctor tracks down the medical team, its shift is over and, following protocol, whatever doses remained are now in the garbage.

Isolated incident? Not a chance, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told NBC News.

“This kind of thing is pretty rampant,” Jha said. “I have personally heard stories like this from dozens of physician friends in a variety of different states. Hundreds, if not thousands, of doses are getting tossed across the country every day. It’s unbelievable.”

Jha said the ER doctor whose story he laid out in a Twitter thread this week asked to not be identified, but his story, seen by thousands of people, resonated with other medical professionals frustrated by rules and regulations that they say are making it harder to get more Americans vaccinated.

Why is this happening? Covid-19 vaccines have a short shelf life once they are thawed out for use, Jha said. And because of federal and state mandates, hospitals and other health care providers would rather risk a dose going bad than give it to somebody who isn't scheduled to get a shot.

At the same time, states like Massachusetts now have rules requiring hospitals to report the number of vaccine doses that have been discarded, Jha said.

“The problem is that hospitals that do report this get pilloried in the press for wasting vaccines,” Jha said. “So, many hospitals are not reporting and this is happening across the country.”

While there doesn’t appear to be any solid numbers yet of how many of the Covid-19 vaccines have been discarded in the United States since the rollout began last month, the World Health Organization warned in 2005 that up to 50 percent of the vaccines released globally each year end up in the dumpster because of supply chain problems, such as not having enough freezer space or transportation issues.

Some of those same problem have dogged the Trump administration’s efforts to roll out the Covid-19 vaccines.

“I hope (and pray) it is not as high as 50 percent, given the thousands of people that are dying every day,” said Dr. Sadiya Khan, an epidemiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “While it is an inevitable reality that a proportion of doses may be wasted, it will take careful planning and oversight to minimize waste.”

Infectious disease expert Dr. John Swartzberg agreed.

“I have not seen any data about how much vaccine has been wasted (besides what I read in the newspapers),” said Swartzberg, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. “Given how needed it is, I hope the WHO data is incorrect.”

For Sue Joss, the CEO of the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center in Brockton, Massachusetts, one wasted dose of Covid-19 vaccine is one too many.

It was Christmas Eve, she said, and a staffer scheduled to receive that last remaining shot of the 60 Moderna vaccines that had been removed from cold storage that day did not show up.

“We can’t let this happen again,” Joss recalled saying before the unclaimed dose was trashed.

So, Joss put into place a system to ensure that if somebody fails to show up for an appointment, there is another person ready and waiting to take his or her place. “We now have a waiting list of people who can come in on short notice to get a shot,” she said.

But that’s not foolproof either, Joss added.

“One time last week, we went marching through the halls to find a patient willing to get a shot, so a dose wouldn’t go to waste,” she said.

Similar stories of unused doses landing in the garbage have been reported elsewhere in the country.

Dozens of doses earmarked for two hospitals in Portland, Oregon, were thrown away when officials couldn’t round up enough health care workers to get the shots before the vaccines expired.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo loosened rules designed to ensure that the first shots went to front-line health care workers and retirement home residents – and that less endangered people did not cut in line – following reports that unused vaccines were being thrown away.

And in Ohio, three dozen doses landed in the garbage after a nursing home in Lawrence County overestimated the number of vaccines it needed, forcing the pharmacists administering the shots to search for takers.

“They did everything they could,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said. “They got everyone who would take a shot but they had some leftover, a lot of leftover.”

President Donald Trump, whose erratic leadership during the pandemic helped doom his re-election bid, had vowed that 20 million people in the U.S. would be immunized by the end of 2020.

But as of Thursday, 30.6 million doses of coronavirus vaccine had been distributed with just 11.1 million people receiving their first shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination tracker.

The massive coronavirus vaccine rollout in the U.S. has been hobbled by poor planning, a distribution system that relies largely on state and local governments to make those calls, and by well-meaning attempts at limiting the distribution of the first doses to the most vulnerable populations that have backfired.

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to lead the world with more than 23 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and nearly 387,000 deaths, according to data compiled by NBC News and Johns Hopkins University.",MSNBC,"['thousands', 'wind', 'covid19', 'hospitals', 'fed', 'doses', 'health', 'guidelines', 'vaccines', 'team', 'jha', 'state', 'university', 'vaccine', 'garbage', 'shots']",0

You’re often barred from visiting them if they live in a facility. You may struggle to find willing aides if they’re living at home. You’re likely worried about their physical and mental health. And above all else, you’re terrified that in helping your loved one, you might expose them to the potentially deadly coronavirus.

I know this firsthand as the primary caregiver to my mom, who everyone lovingly calls, “Bamba.”

Just a year ago, we were planning a huge opening at the Boca Raton Museum of Art. Then after that it would be on to Miami at the Lowe Art Museum. As a sculptor, many of her days back then were spent in the studio, with a chainsaw in hand, preparing her signature, massive wood sculptures. She would also come to my house to swim for her daily exercise, see her grandchildren and visit with our pets. We’d all share a meal together.

No longer.

Like many Americans, Bamba, who also suffers from a bit of dementia, had to completely change her lifestyle due to Covid-19. She lives in what I call “the Bamba Bubble.” I’ve had to find a new approach to helping care of my mom to ensure she stays safe until she gets the vaccine—which I hope will be soon. We keep calling trying to find one for her.

It’s been hard and scary for her, and as each month ticks by, it’s become more challenging and it has impacted her health dramatically. In fact, just a few weeks ago, Bamba became dehydrated and fainted. We rushed her to the closest hospital, which was overrun with Covid-19 patients. Because the hospital was so full, they took her from me and slammed the door, leaving me outside. She had to sit in a cold room by herself for 10 hours. I was beside myself, knowing that she would grow increasingly confused.

Doctors would call me as I waited in the parking lot. They couldn’t find anything wrong except her sodium levels were off and as a result, they would need to keep her overnight. I was terrified for her. I begged for hours to come in and stay with her. They finally relented, and I was able to stay with her for the night if we stayed in the room with the door closed. The next morning, it was discovered that machine that checked her sodium levels was broken and that my mom’s numbers were fine! It was frustrating, and it took Bamba nearly two weeks to bounce back from the incident, which we still don’t know the cause of.

We did our face creams together, and we did our best to keep a good mood going and got through the long night together.

Much of my day now is spent with my mom and just trying to keep her healthy. She needs my company to feel normal during these extraordinarily abnormal times. I moved everything inside the “Bamba Bubble.”

Her garage is a gym, with a bench, light weights and a stability ball. Since she can’t come to my house to swim anymore (it’s just too risky with kids in our house), I go to her and we lift weights together a few times a week, even just for five minutes at a time.

We’ve also turned her patio into what I call the “Bamba jungle.” She loves gardening and trees, so I literally brought them to her. The patio is now stuffed with all sorts of plants and trees that touch the ceiling and are growing across the screened roof. It’s where she spends most of her time now with my dad’s dog Daisy. It’s an oasis of calm in our chaotic world. We love it.

No matter what, I make sure she gets outside every day. It might be biking alongside me, walking Daisy, or with my daughter who is currently living at home. It might just be a few minutes outside, or a lot longer. But the fresh air does wonders to lift her spirits and mine.

I even get her out on my little, very tippy boat. The wind keeps the air fresh so it’s becoming an afternoon ritual. I drive it so slow, about three miles an hour, but it’s something to do. I also bring our animals, both the big ones and small ones, over to her. Bamba immediately starts laughing and smiling at the sight of one of our pets.

My advice if you’re taking care of an aging parent, keep it simple. Pets, walks, an herb garden, crafts. Whenever you have time, engage. It doesn’t matter if it’s in-person, on FaceTime, or on the phone. It’s a very lonely time for many of our elderly parents, so percolate their lives with your voice and joy.

Call often, even if they don’t remember it. Talk about family and the fun things that grandchildren are doing, and its OK if you repeat yourself. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming, and one might want to put those calls off. DON’T. Make it a routine to check in. And when you do, dig deep on positive topics.

There’s no need to weigh them down with the gravity of the situation, talking about the news or the daily death toll. Focus on the positive and overlook the negative. Talk about what’s in their power to enjoy.

Typically, my mom watches a lot of cable news. She likes to see me on “Morning Joe” and know what’s going on in the world. But now, we watch a lot more animal and gardening shows. If you have an aging parent with real health issues, pandemic news can be very depressing. Now, Bamba and I talk about art, her grandchildren, exercise, and our animals, which have brought us an enormous amount of joy and distraction during these uncertain times.

I am among the blessed. I am lucky to be close to my mom to see her in person. I am lucky to be able to be a personal part of her daily life, and I am grateful every day for this. Every time I want to complain, even for a second, I say it out loud: We are blessed. We just have to take it day by day to get through this difficult time. Eventually, the pandemic fog will lift.

I still dream that my mom will have her art show. And I know that one day she will. We won’t give up. Not on Bamba, no way!

Healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente on Tuesday denied any delay in reporting the Covid-19 cases connected to a Christmas party at its San Jose Medical Center's emergency department.

""The suggestion that we are anything other than forthcoming with our reporting is inaccurate,"" Kaiser Permanente said in a statement to NBC News, adding it has ""maintained consistent communications with multiple state and local agencies regarding COVID-19 cases at our facilities.""

The fine issued on last Tuesday is $1,000 for each delayed report of a positive case, but since early January the number of infections connected to the Christmas event has ballooned from 43 to over 90.

As of Tuesday, county health officials said that they have counted 77 staff and 15 patient cases connected to the event. One staff member died.

The Santa Clara County Department of Public Health said it was was unaware of the first 43 cases until news reports last week.

""Kaiser Permanente failed to report any of these cases in the County’s Worksite Case and Contact Reporting Portal as it is required to do by the Public Health Order issued on Oct. 5,"" the department said in a statement.

Earlier this month, Kaiser Permanente said the inflatable Christmas tree costume — while still not definitively linked to the outbreak, county health officials clarified — was an innocent gesture that ""only sought to lift the spirits of those around them during what is a very stressful time.""

2021-01-15 05:33:04+00:00,47,"TERRE HAUTE, Ind. — The U.S. government executed a drug trafficker Thursday for his involvement in a series of slayings in Virginia’s capital city in 1992, despite claims by his lawyers that the lethal injection would cause excruciating pain due to lung damage from his recent Covid-19 infection.

Corey Johnson, 52, was the 12th inmate put to death at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, since the Trump administration restarted federal executions following a 17-year hiatus.

He was pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m.

Johnson’s execution and Friday’s scheduled execution of Dustin Higgs are the last before next week’s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who opposes the federal death penalty and has signaled he’ll end its use. Both inmates contracted Covid-19 and won temporary stays of execution this week for that reason, only for higher courts to allow the lethal injections to move forward.

Lawyers have previously argued the lethal injections of pentobarbital caused flash pulmonary edema, where fluid rapidly fills the lungs, sparking sensations akin to drowning. The new claim was that fluid would rush into the inmates’ Covid-damaged lungs immediately while they were still conscious.

Johnson was implicated in one of the worst bursts of gang violence Richmond had ever seen, with 11 people killed in a 45-day period. He and two other members of the Newtowne gang were sentenced to death under a federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers.

In their clemency petition, Johnson’s lawyers asked President Donald Trump to commute his death sentence to life in prison. They described a traumatic childhood in which he was physically abused by his drug-addicted mother and her boyfriends, abandoned at age 13, then shuffled between residential and institutional facilities until he aged out of the foster care system. They cited numerous childhood IQ tests discovered after he was sentenced that place him in the mentally disabled category and say testing during his time in prison shows he can read and write at only an elementary school level.

In a final statement, Johnson said he was “sorry for my crimes” and said he wanted the victims to be remembered. He said the pizza and strawberry shake he ate and drank before the execution “were wonderful” but he didn’t get the doughnuts he wanted. He also thanked his minister and lawyer.

“I am okay,” he said. “I am at peace.”

In a statement, Johnson’s lawyers said the government executed a person “with an intellectual disability, in stark violation of the Constitution and federal law” and vehemently denied he had the mental capacity to be a so-called drug kingpin.

“The government’s arbitrary rush to execute Mr. Johnson, who was categorically ineligible for execution due to his significant impairments, rested on procedural technicalities rather than any serious dispute that he was intellectually disabled,” the attorneys, Donald Salzman and Ronald Tabak, said.

Government filings have spelled Johnson’s name “Cory,” but his lawyers say he spells it “Corey.”

Richard Benedict, who was Johnson’s special education teacher at a New York school for emotionally troubled kids, said Johnson was hyperactive, anxious and reading and writing at a second- or third-grade level when he was 16 and 17.

“I had to have someone walk him to the bathroom because he just couldn’t get back to the classroom,” Benedict said.

Prosecutors, however, said Johnson had not shown that he was mentally disabled.

“While rejecting that he has intellectual disabilities that preclude his death sentences, courts have repeatedly and correctly concluded that Johnson’s seven murders were planned to advance his drug trafficking and were not impulsive acts by someone incapable of capable making calculated judgments, and are therefore eligible for the death penalty,” prosecutors argue in court documents.

A defense psychologist testified during the trial that Johnson’s IQ was measured at 77, above the threshold score of 75 then needed to label someone as intellectually disabled. Johnson’s appellate lawyers say that psychologist was not an expert in intellectual disability and relied on standards that are now outdated.

C.T. Woody Jr., the lead homicide detective on the case, said that during his interrogations of Johnson, he denied any involvement in the killings and said police were trying to frame him because of lies people were telling about him.

“It did not seem to me that he had any kind of mental problems at all except his viciousness and no respect for human life — none whatsoever,” Woody said.

Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Vick Jr., one of the prosecutors in the case, said the violence committed by Johnson and his fellow gang members was unmatched at the time. One of the gang’s victims was stabbed 85 times and another was shot 16 times. Johnson was convicted of being the shooter in a triple slaying, and participating in four other capital murders, including shooting a rival drug dealer 15 times.

“The heinousness of the crimes, the utter senselessness of the crimes, the crimes themselves warranted the seeking of the death penalty this case,” Vick said.

In his clemency petition, Johnson’s lawyers said he has repeatedly expressed “sincere remorse” for his crimes.

“I’m sorry for the great number of people who are dead, you know, and there is a lot on us, and I feel we are no angels,” he said during his sentencing hearing. He also spoke to a group of students present in the courtroom that day and urged them not to commit crimes or make the mistakes he had made in his life.",MSNBC,"['killer', 'johnson', 'execution', 'gang', 'johnsons', 'crimes', 'federal', 'lawyers', 'death', 'say', 'terre', 'executed', 'despite', 'virginia', 'infection', 'drug', 'covid']",0

Operation Warp Speed had previously held back half of the doses in an effort to make sure recipients could receive their second dose. Both vaccines currently in use require two doses, three to four weeks apart, for maximum effectiveness.

Earlier Monday, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., said she had received a positive rapid Covid-19 test.

“I received a positive test result for COVID-19, and am home resting at this time. While I am experiencing mild, cold-like symptoms, I remain in good spirits and will continue to work on behalf of my constituents,"" Watson Coleman said in a statement.

The congresswoman is isolating and waiting for the results of a PCR test, which is known to be more accurate than rapid tests.

News of the lawmakers’ tests comes a day after the Capitol physician warned members and congressional staff that they could have been exposed to someone infected with the virus when they were sheltering in place. A video circulated last week that showed a House Democrat in a secure room offering face masks to a group of her fellow Republicans, who were seen turning them down.

In July, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a mask mandate for all members and staffers on the House floor.

Jayapal said that lawmakers who refuse to wear masks in the Capitol should be fined.

“Additionally, any Member who refuses to wear a mask should be immediately removed from the floor by the Sergeant at Arms,” she said. “This is not a joke. Our lives and our livelihoods are at risk, and anyone who refuses to wear a mask should be fully held accountable for endangering our lives because of their selfish idiocy.”",MSNBC,"['mask', 'covid19', 'lawmaker', 'tests', 'positive', 'watson', 'house', 'lawmakers', 'statement', 'wear', 'lockdown', 'refused', 'capitol', 'covid']",0

The records come as cases and deaths reach new highs in the United Kingdom after a mutant strain of Covid-19 was detected there. At least 50 cases of the more contagious variant have been identified so far in the U.S.

The U.S. reported 269,420 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, a new record. Two states also set new daily highs: Maine with 41 deaths and New York with 18,687 cases.

There have been more than 369,000 deaths in the U.S.

As cases and deaths climb, American scientists are working around-the-clock to determine how widespread the U.K. variant is. Since the strain was found late last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has promised to ramp up genetic sequencing in the U.S., which is needed to find new strains.

A spokesperson for the CDC said the agency is working with state health officials and academic and public health laboratories to double the number of samples sequenced every week.

In the U.K., the strain is pushing hospitals to their breaking points.

""Our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid-19 than at any time since the start of the pandemic,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

Paramedic Ben Schischa said the situation has become ""completely crazy"" and that the number of people confirmed or suspected to have Covid-19 has ""exploded exponentially"" compared to even a week or two ago.

Schischa has been on the front lines of the pandemic since March and said he has seen patients wait in ambulances for hours until a hospital had enough space for them.

The study focused on 1,733 people who were hospitalized with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China — where the coronavirus was first detected — from last January to May. Many were hospitalized before the illness even had a name.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Roughly three-quarters of the patients reported lingering symptoms six months after their initial diagnosis. Sixty-three percent said they still had fatigue or muscle weakness, 23 percent cited anxiety or depression, and 26 percent reported trouble sleeping.

""Our analysis indicates that most patients continue to live with at least some of the effects of the virus after leaving hospital, and highlights a need for post-discharge care,"" Dr. Bin Cao, an author of the study and vice director of the Center for Respiratory Diseases at China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, said in a statement.

This was an observational study, however, meaning it is impossible to link those symptoms directly to the coronavirus. In order to show a true connection, studies would need to compare outcomes of Covid-19 to those hospitalized with similar infections that could also cause pneumonia.

""I would have liked to have seen data on patients admitted with something other than Covid-19 during that period,"" said Dr. Hana El Sahly, an associate professor of molecular virology and microbiology and of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. She was not involved in the new research.

""Being admitted with pneumonia can be a traumatic event for anyone,"" El Sahly said, adding that it's not uncommon for those patients to have lingering symptoms.

The study also found that those with the most severe cases still had trouble breathing six months later. More than half who required a ventilator for their illness later experienced a condition that reduces oxygen flow from the lungs into the bloodstream. And they were more likely to struggle to complete a test of walking endurance.

But it is unclear whether that impaired lung function is a result of the virus or related to an underlying health condition. While the study participants were all hospitalized, few were admitted to the intensive care unit, meaning the findings may not apply to the sickest patients.

""Because Covid-19 is such a new disease, we are only beginning to understand some of its long-term effects on patients' health,"" Cao said. He added that the research may serve to highlight a need for increased care for Covid-19 patients even after they are discharged from the hospital.

2021-01-08 13:41:19+00:00,111,"The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, a clear indication that the pandemic’s chokehold on economic activity strengthened in the final weeks of last year.

The unemployment rate held steady at 6.7 percent.

In the final jobs report of 2020, Friday’s monthly employment snapshot from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a labor market teetering on the brink at the end of a tumultuous year.

“The December employment report paints a wintry picture for the U.S. economy, including the first decline in hiring since last spring,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. ""Between the human and economic tolls taken by the pandemic, these are some of the darkest hours of this soon-to-be yearlong tragedy.”

Economists say the numbers lay bare the struggles facing American workers, and represent a mandate for President-elect Joe Biden's administration to accomplish two things: Address the immediate financial needs of these households, and develop a longer-term solution that fosters job growth and protects the workers most vulnerable to disenfranchisement.

“It’s eerily reminiscent of when Joe Biden took office as vice president facing a significant jobs challenge,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. “I think they're going to have a lot of urgency to do something early on.”

""These are some of the darkest hours of this soon-to-be yearlong tragedy.”

The government data comes just two days after a report by payroll processor ADP found that the private sector lost 123,000 jobs in December, the first decline since April.

A report from executive outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that planned job cuts rose nearly 20 percent in December on a monthly basis. The roughly 77,000 jobs companies announced plans to shed is 135 percent higher than a year ago.

Economists had predicted that worsening Covid-19 infection rates in the winter months could damage economic recovery, even as the promise of a vaccine has spurred hope on Wall Street and propelled the stock market to record highs. President Donald Trump has treated the stock market as a barometer of his term and a proxy for success. Observers predict that Biden will view the nation’s economic health through a markedly different lens.

“I think the Biden administration will prioritize the labor market and I think they have a partner in Congress now that has the same priority,” Stettner said.

A Democratic White House and Congress makes the prospect of more generous stimulus legislation all but certain. Even after the stimulus package the lame-duck Congress completed at the end of the year, there is still broad agreement on the need for further fiscal support, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.

“The prescription has been fairly consistently enunciated from the business community, as well as our central bankers, because they understand there’s only so much of a fulcrum they can lean on with monetary policy,” Hamrick said.

One obvious entry point with the potential to draw bipartisan support is infrastructure investment, since years of kicking the can down the road have left roads, railways and bridges around the nation in need of repair. “Ironically, that was the promise President Trump came to Washington on,” Hamrick said.

Stettner said the administration will need to address the significant racial and gender disparities in the labor market’s halting recovery. “As things began to open up, it really was white workers who were able to get back to work at a faster clip,” he said.

The ADP report showed that contraction in leisure and hospitality businesses dominated December’s slide, accounting for roughly half of the job losses for the month. This has a disproportionate impact on Americans who are already among the most marginalized populations, Stettner said. “The service sector where women of color get most of their work has been most affected,” he said. A lack of child care, he added, has driven women out of the workforce more broadly, as they take on the bulk of that additional, unpaid labor.

The specific nature of the pandemic’s labor market distortions obscures the picture of exactly how dire circumstances have become in those sectors, said Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz SE.

“The issue is it really hides the drop in active populations of people [who] have stopped looking for a job, because they know in their sector there might not be any jobs,” he said. While the BLS data does include alternate measures of under- and unemployment, Subran said these metrics fail to capture the extent to which the pandemic has annihilated entire industries.

He urged the Biden administration to consider “opening the box” and exploring direct, robust labor market interventions such as federal training and reskilling initiatives that have been deployed in Europe but never caught on amidst the fraying of America’s social safety net.

“You need to bring some of the people that used to work in the service industry into other sectors,” Subran said. “I would advocate for a Democratic administration to really go ‘Marshall Plan’ on learning, upskilling, intermediation, requalification,” he said.",MSNBC,"['job', 'administration', 'need', 'labor', 'biden', 'economic', 'economy', 'month', 'presidency', 'final', 'jobs', '140000', 'hamrick', 'lost', 'market', 'trump', 'report']",0

""America is and must always be a nation of law and order. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy,"" Trump said. ""To those who engaged in acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay.""

Although it was filled with numerous falsehoods, the statement marks a stark shift for Trump, who only Wednesday had been slow to call for the rioters to disperse and had to be persuaded to send reinforcements for Capitol Police as the building was under siege.

His remarks Thursday were a remarkable about-face from the video he released Wednesday shortly after rioters stormed the building following a Trump rally, disrupting Congress as it was formally affirming President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. Lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the count, were forced to flee. At least four people died.

He told rioters: ""We love you. You're very special.""

After the violence, however, Trump has faced growing calls from lawmakers for his impeachment for having encouraged supporters to march on the Capitol. There has also been increasing pressure on Pence and other Cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to remove Trump from office just days before his term ends.

Over the last four years, he has rarely criticized acts of violence or racism by supporters.

Trump offered a rare reflection on the damage that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused Americans, and he also acknowledged his loss to Biden.

""Now Congress has certified the results, and the new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation,"" he said.

It was also a shift from a statement released Wednesday on Twitter through Dan Scavino, his deputy chief of staff for communications, in which Trump repeated baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.

In the statement, Trump promised an ""orderly transition"" of power but also said, ""I totally disagree with the outcome of the election.""",MSNBC,"['told', 'seamless', 'election', 'transition', 'loss', 'violence', 'removal', 'shift', 'reverses', 'positions', 'calls', 'statement', 'supporters', 'rioters', 'facing', 'capitol', 'trump', 'covid']",0

2021-01-04 20:27:25+00:00,91,"LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a new national lockdown in England, including the most stringent level of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, to slow down the spiral in new cases of Covid-19 on the same day the U.K. started the rollout of AstraZeneca's vaccine.

The measures are similar to the lockdown imposed last March, and include asking the public to stay at home and leave for only limited reasons. Trips outside will be allowed for only essential shopping, exercise, Covid-19 testing, medical help, escaping domestic abuse and work for those who can't work from home.

Primary, secondary schools and colleges will also have to switch to remote learning starting Tuesday.

People who don't live together are not allowed to mix, but support and childcare bubbles are still allowed.

Speaking in a late-night televised address, Johnson warned that the weeks ahead will be the hardest yet, but he believes the country is entering the last phase of the struggle.

""I know how tough this is and I know how frustrated you are,"" Johnson said. ""But now more than ever, we must pull together.""

Johnson said people should follow the new rules, which will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning, starting immediately.

The measures announced apply only to England, where Johnson sets policy, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales — the other three countries in the U.K. — setting their own rules.

Earlier on Monday, Scotland announced a full, legally enforced lockdown with people ordered to stay at home for January except for essential purposes.

“It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation that we face now than I have been at any time since March,” Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.

The U.K. has topped 50,000 new daily cases for seven days in a row, recording 58,784 new cases on Monday, the highest since the pandemic started, as its publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) is under tremendous pressure from rising hospitalizations.

The increase is likely fueled by a new and more transmissible variant of the virus that was first detected in England in November, prompting the government to toughen restrictions ahead of Christmas.

Much of England was already living under the toughest level of restriction under a four-tier system of regional regulations.

Just hours before Johnson's announcement, the country's medical chiefs moved U.K.'s Covid-19 alert to the highest level, saying that without further action, there was ""a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days.""

Johnson’s health minister, Matt Hancock, said that the new coronavirus variant is harder to control and that the old tier system in England was ""no longer strong enough.”

Also Monday, the U.K. began administering the vaccine produced by the British drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University, with more than half a million doses ready to be given.

On his visit to a London hospital to see health workers receiving the vaccine, Johnson said earlier on Monday there was no question that the government would have to impose tougher measures to tackle the virus, warning of ""tough, tough"" weeks to come.

He also promised that the number of Covid-19 vaccine doses will amount to tens of millions by the end of March. There are 67 million people living in the U.K.

Last month the U.K. became the first country to administer the approved BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine.

Since then, there has been confusion over vaccine allocation in the U.K., with the British government prioritizing getting a first dose of a vaccine to as many people as possible over giving second doses, raising concerns from some experts because of the departure from the dosage regime tested in clinic trials.

About 50 percent of front-line workers in California’s Riverside County have refused to take the vaccine, Riverside Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari told The Los Angeles Times on Thursday. California is currently overwhelmed with cases as hospital staff in Southern California face a shortage of intensive-care units and have created makeshift units.

Vaccine development and distribution has been the target of persistent conspiracy theories and disinformation on social media, although it's unclear how much impact this anti-vaccination movement has had on overall public trust in the process.

About 2 in 10 Americans are certain they will not change their mind about refusing the vaccine, according to data from the Pew Research Center. And 62 percent said they would be uncomfortable being among the first to receive the vaccine.

Anecdotally, an estimated 60 percent of Ohio nursing home employees have refused the vaccine already, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during a news briefing Wednesday. It's a stark contrast to the number of nursing home residents who have taken the vaccine when offered, which DeWine guessed to be about 85 percent.

“We’re not going to make them, but we wish we had a higher compliance,” DeWine said. “And our message today is: The train may not be coming back for awhile. We’re going to make it available to everyone eventually, but this is the opportunity for you, and you should really think about getting it.”

Rollout for the vaccine has already been met with several logistical hurdles as only 2.6 million people have been vaccinated as of Wednesday. A review by NBC News of earlier data Tuesday found that at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.

It’s unclear how refusal by essential workers, who are prioritized to receive the vaccine in the first phase of administration, could further hamper the distribution efforts.

A survey of 2,053 New York City firefighters found that more than half said they would refuse the Covid-19 vaccine when it became available to them, according to a poll released by the Uniformed Firefighters Association this month.

Some of those firefighters may overlap with those who have already contracted the coronavirus and don’t believe they need to get the inoculation, Andy Ansbro, the union president, said.

""As a union we are encouraging our members to get the vaccine, but we are defending their right to make that choice,"" Ansbro said. ""I personally feel this vaccine is safe, I've done my own research, I will be getting the vaccine and I will be encouraging other members to do so. In the end, it is their own personal choice.""

Ansboro was among the many essential workers who received the vaccine, according to a photo posted by the UFA on Tuesday. The FDNY reported that 1,000 members had been vaccinated by Tuesday.

A number of politicians, public health officials and front-line workers have taken the vaccine publicly to assert confidence in the shots, including leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President Mike Pence.

Intensive care unit nurse Sandra Linsdsay was among the first in the country to receive the vaccine, telling reporters that she felt “relieved” afterward.

2021-01-03 07:32:01+00:00,27,"The nation's state and federal courts responded quickly to the coronavirus pandemic, adapting courthouses to conduct trials and finding the public ready to serve as jurors, Chief Justice John Roberts said Thursday in his annual year-end message on the judiciary.

""Judges from around the country report that, where jury trials have resumed, responses to jury summonses have met or exceeded their high hopes for the public's willingness to participate in the legal system during these very challenging times,"" Roberts said.

The pandemic forced courthouses nationwide to close in March, but by April, Roberts said, judges “were guiding critical court functions from their home offices — or their kitchen tables"" and were learning ""quickly or at least eventually"" to use audio and video conferencing tools.

The U.S. Supreme Court was among the adopters, canceling courtroom sittings in the spring and instead hearing oral argument by telephone conferences for the first time, a practice that continued when the court's new term began in October.

To accommodate jury trials, trial courts reconfigured spaces, repurposing large courtrooms to maintain social distancing and installing Plexiglas to keep participants physically separated. Judges in Michigan and Florida held drive-through naturalization ceremonies, and courts in Iowa and Minnesota moved theirs outdoors, he said.

Ordinary civil case filings were down 10 percent for the year, and 25 percent fewer defendants were charged with immigration offenses ""largely in response to a 70 percent reduction in defendants accused of improper entry,"" his report said.

Robert noted some of the history of the high court's responses to outbreaks, saying that America's first chief justice, John Jay, had to adjourn the young Supreme Court from sitting in Philadelphia in 1793 due to the yellow fever epidemic that killed 5,000 of the city's 50,000 residents.

As of Saturday, New York had 1,014,044 confirmed cases, according to NBC News counts. California remains at the top of the list with 2.3 million confirmed cases, the most of any state in the country. Los Angeles County alone has reported about 806,210 cases as of Saturday, according to public health officials.

Florida and Texas have 1.3 million cases and 1.7 million cases, respectively.

Also on Saturday, the U.S. reported more than 350,000 coronavirus-related deaths.

Public health officials in New York say the official number of cases represents a significant undercount, since many people in the New York City area were infected with the coronavirus last spring when testing was largely unavailable, NBC New York reported.

""As we start 2021, I encourage all New Yorkers to look to their better angels and continue the practices we know stop the spread of this virus — wash your hands, socially distance and wear a mask,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.

Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that the city plans to to vaccinate 1 million residents in January alone.

The United States ended 2020 with the deadliest and most infectious month since the start of the pandemic.

More than 77,000 people died in December, while 6.4 million people contracted the virus amid the emergence of a new variant and delayed efforts to vaccinate people. The second-deadliest month was April 2020, with more than 58,000 deaths.

At least four cases of the Covid-19 variant first detected in the United Kingdom have recently been reported in Colorado, California and Florida, but public health experts believe it is likely circulating elsewhere in the country.

In other developments Saturday, hospitals officials said 43 staff members at Kaiser Permanente San Jose Emergency Department in California tested positive for Covid-19 between Dec. 27 and Jan. 1.

The hospital said all areas in the emergency department were undergoing deep cleaning and that employees who tested positive for Covid-19 or are suspected of having the coronavirus due to symptoms will follow isolation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The hospital is investigating whether a staff member who briefly visited the emergency department on Christmas Day wearing an air-powered costume with a fan may have unintentionally caused air droplets to spread.

Officials said such costumes will no longer be allowed inside the buildings.

At the same time, news of possible mishandling of vaccine distribution, as recently reported in New York City urgent care centers, shows how important it is to be vigilant and press lawmakers and public health officials to be transparent in their distribution strategies and to hold them accountable for their decisions.

The lack of any federal strategy has left every state, county and tribal territory to their own devices.

Since the approval and rollout of the vaccine, America has watched the painfully paradoxical images of boxes of vaccines being unloaded from distribution trucks alongside FEMA-operated refrigerated morgue trailers parked at hospitals. In the same building, health care workers have literally been receiving a shot in the arm that could save their lives within hours of pronouncing a patient dead.

Still, the lack of any federal strategy has left every state, county and tribal territory to their own devices, to identify strategies and submit plans for their respective distribution process.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent agency, has made recommendations that identify the high priority groups: 1A encompasses health care personnel and long-term care residents; and 1B adults over the age of 75 and front-line essential workers (such as first responders, police, educators, U.S. Postal Service workers, corrections officers and others).

But a review of the various states’ vaccination plans reveals that many states are not following the ACIP recommendations and that there is a degree of variability that could have significant impact and create more confusion than comprehension. For example, Arkansas has long-term care facilities in their second phase, after health care workers and other essential workers, despite over 100,000 long-term care residents and staff who have died from Covid-19.

Maryland has teachers and day care operators in the second phase, behind other essential personnel, potentially extending school closures and creating tension between parents who must work and the teachers and day care providers who want to be safe while caring for students. The state of Texas has also deviated from the ACIP recommendations and prioritized people over the age of 65 as well as those over the age of 16 with certain chronic conditions.

The rationale behind these variations can appear sound and reasonable; for example, trying to prioritize people with chronic conditions seems compelling, since rates of death from Covid-19 were 12 times higher in people with chronic conditions compared to those without diabetes, heart disease or cancer. But it is also highly likely that people with such conditions are able to take precautions and avoid high-risk situations.

Ethnic minorities comprise a significant number of essential workers, which only exacerbates the ongoing health disparities uncovered by Covid-19.

Essential workers, particularly front-line workers such as public transit operators, postal carriers, teachers and food supply workers, are critical to the prospects of preserving essential services and are at incredibly high risk, often without any high quality personal protective equipment or an ability to practice social distancing. Further, ethnic minorities comprise a significant number of essential workers, which only exacerbates the ongoing health disparities uncovered by Covid-19.

The goal of any vaccine distribution strategy is to balance societal need, and ethics and science and allow for flexibility to make decisions like the ones Texas, Maryland and Arkansas have had to make. But when a pandemic of this nature has gripped the world, wielding death and destruction without limits, ushering many of us into the quiet corners of our homes in isolation and fear, the demand for a vaccine is inextricably linked with a sense of fairness and equity.

Even as a physician who works in a clinic setting, I have no problem waiting my turn after my higher-risk colleagues in the hospitals receive their vaccines. Images of members of Congress who downplayed the impact of the virus now receiving the vaccine feel like a slap in the face. Continuity of government seems meaningless when that same government delays a stimulus package and promotes protests against stay-at-home orders and mask mandates.

Continuity of government seems meaningless when that same government delays a stimulus package and promotes protests against stay-at-home orders and mask mandates.

Fast forward 30 days from now when simply crossing state lines can make the difference in whether you receive the vaccine or not. As thousands of people continue to die each day and millions more Americans contract Covid-19, even a one-week delay can feel like an eternity. In the beginning, demand will far outstrip supply, and there will no doubt be an underground market of sorts to try to access the vaccine early.

While we are still trying to navigate the uncharted waters of the pandemic, we have unfortunately become accustomed to expecting the worst and witnessing inequities often wielded by a callous president and his inner circle. But we do have new hope in the form of a vaccine. Let us not squander this hope by repeating our mistakes.",MSNBC,"['strategy', 'teachers', 'health', 'essential', 'distribution', 'significant', 'care', 'state', 'deciding', 'vaccine', 'workers', 'covid']",0

2021-01-02 13:01:06+00:00,106,"Despite the rollout of two new vaccines, the pandemic is accelerating and the United States should brace itself for “one of the worst months in this nation’s history in January,” one of President-elect Joe Biden’s top Covid-19 advisers warned Monday.

“There is no doubt about that,” the expert, Dr. Celine Gounder, said on CNBC. “That cake is in the oven already, with the travel that has happened over the holidays.”

That dire warning came as the number of Covid-19 infections rose past 19.2 million after Christmas and the number of deaths from coronavirus neared 334,000, the latest NBC News data showed.

Gounder, a member of the Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, described a nightmarish scenario in which local health officials are forced to erect field hospitals because hallways and even some parking lots are already packed with sick patients.

And an even bigger crisis, Gounder said, will be finding enough doctors and nurses to treat everybody.

“You can't stand up new doctors and nurses the way you can field hospitals,” Gounder said. “You can't just create them out of thin air.”

In other coronavirus developments:

While more than a million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have already been administered in the last week and a third vaccine from Novavax is in the late stages of development, Gounder said the pace needs to be ramped-up to a million shots a day to stop the pandemic.

“It's not just about the vaccines,” Gounder said. “You have to also get the vaccines distributed and you need staff to administer the vaccines. And when staff are all tied up in ICUs that are overflowing with sick patients, it's very difficult to siphon off those staff away to do vaccination.”

That’s already the sad reality in Southern California, said Dr. Brad Spellberg, the chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, on MSNBC on Monday.

Spellberg said his hospital’s intensive care unit has been full “for going on three weeks,” and it struggles every day to find enough nurses to take care of all of its patients.

“You can't snap your fingers and will those people into existence,” Spellberg said. “As patients flood the hospital, there’s only so many of those people to go around.”

The incoming Biden administration intends to invoke the Defense Production Act to make sure there are enough “raw materials for the vaccines” and personal protective equipment, to increase testing and to employ genetic surveillance to detect new strains of Covid-19, Gounder said.

“I think it is going to be a massive operational challenge, probably the biggest this country has ever had to undertake to vaccinate all of its citizens in a timely fashion,” Gounder said. “In the last two weeks, we basically averaged about a million doses of vaccine administered per week. We need to be getting to a million doses per day.”

In the meantime, Gounder said, because so many Americans traveled and gathered for Christmas despite the numerous warnings from health experts that this was a sure-fire way of spreading the coronavirus, “we’re going to see another surge just like we did after Thanksgiving.”

The federal Transportation Security Administration screened 1,284,599 travelers at U.S. airports on Sunday, the most since the pandemic was declared in March.

“We’re going to see another surge in January, and hospitals are going to be facing that when they’re already full,” Gounder said. “We already have patients being treated in hallways, in parking lots.”

Gounder said the Biden administration also intends to increase surveillance of the new Covid-19 mutations that have already sickened people in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

“We did not do that routinely,” Gounder said. “We have the technology. We just chose not to spend the money on that kind of public health surveillance.”",MSNBC,"['warns', 'worst', 'adviser', 'gounder', 'going', 'covid19', 'hospitals', 'biden', 'coronavirus', 'patients', 'surveillance', 'vaccines', 'surge', 'million', 'postchristmas', 'staff', 'covid']",0

The memorial will offer a stark contrast to President Donald Trump's leadership during the pandemic.

2021-01-01 09:02:05+00:00,36,"A large percentage of front-line workers in hospitals and nursing homes have refused to take the Covid-19 vaccine, a hurdle for public health officials as the country struggles to roll out inoculations around the country.

About 50 percent of front-line workers in California’s Riverside County have refused to take the vaccine, Riverside Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari told The Los Angeles Times on Thursday. California is currently overwhelmed with cases as hospital staff in Southern California face a shortage of intensive-care units and have created makeshift units.

Vaccine development and distribution has been the target of persistent conspiracy theories and disinformation on social media, although it's unclear how much impact this anti-vaccination movement has had on overall public trust in the process.

About 2 in 10 Americans are certain they will not change their mind about refusing the vaccine, according to data from the Pew Research Center. And 62 percent said they would be uncomfortable being among the first to receive the vaccine.

Anecdotally, an estimated 60 percent of Ohio nursing home employees have refused the vaccine already, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during a news briefing Wednesday. It's a stark contrast to the number of nursing home residents who have taken the vaccine when offered, which DeWine guessed to be about 85 percent.

“We’re not going to make them, but we wish we had a higher compliance,” DeWine said. “And our message today is: The train may not be coming back for awhile. We’re going to make it available to everyone eventually, but this is the opportunity for you, and you should really think about getting it.”

Rollout for the vaccine has already been met with several logistical hurdles as only 2.6 million people have been vaccinated as of Wednesday. A review by NBC News of earlier data Tuesday found that at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.

It’s unclear how refusal by essential workers, who are prioritized to receive the vaccine in the first phase of administration, could further hamper the distribution efforts.

A survey of 2,053 New York City firefighters found that more than half said they would refuse the Covid-19 vaccine when it became available to them, according to a poll released by the Uniformed Firefighters Association this month.

Some of those firefighters may overlap with those who have already contracted the coronavirus and don’t believe they need to get the inoculation, Andy Ansbro, the union president, said.

""As a union we are encouraging our members to get the vaccine, but we are defending their right to make that choice,"" Ansbro said. ""I personally feel this vaccine is safe, I've done my own research, I will be getting the vaccine and I will be encouraging other members to do so. In the end, it is their own personal choice.""

Ansboro was among the many essential workers who received the vaccine, according to a photo posted by the UFA on Tuesday. The FDNY reported that 1,000 members had been vaccinated by Tuesday.

A number of politicians, public health officials and front-line workers have taken the vaccine publicly to assert confidence in the shots, including leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President Mike Pence.

Intensive care unit nurse Sandra Linsdsay was among the first in the country to receive the vaccine, telling reporters that she felt “relieved” afterward.

“I feel the healing is coming,” Linsdsay said. “I hope this marks the beginning of the end of the very painful time in our history.""",MSNBC,"['struggles', 'rollout', 'frontline', 'nursing', 'public', 'health', 'distribution', 'firefighters', 'vaccines', 'receive', 'refuse', 'vaccine', 'refused', 'workers', 'members', 'covid']",0

The chaotic year saw the world roiled by a deadly pandemic, so it's only fitting that New Year's celebrations worldwide were muted or canceled altogether as authorities tried to stop crowds from gathering to limit the spread of the virus.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday morning expressed a sentiment that was surely shared by many others: ""We are so ready to kick 2020 out the door.""

The Times Square ball drop, held in honor of health care workers, first responders, essential workers and others, was livestreamed and broadcast. Musical acts referenced the lives lost in the pandemic. Gloria Gaynor sang ""I Will Survive.""

Amid growing concern about global spread of a new coronavirus variant first found in the United Kingdom, more people have been forced into lockdowns, putting a damper on the traditional celebrations and the usual throngs of revelers.

""I can imagine that there will be plenty of people who will be only too happy to say goodbye to the grimness of 2020,"" United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a video address Thursday.

""But just before we do, I want to remind you that this was also the year when we rediscovered a spirit of togetherness, of community,"" he said. ""It was a year in which we banged saucepans to celebrate the courage and self-sacrifice of our NHS (National Health Service) staff and care home workers, a year in which working people pulled the stops out to keep the country moving in the biggest crisis we've faced for generations.""

In Sydney, which was among the first big cities to ring in 2021, the city's traditional New Year's celebrations were scaled back amid harsher restrictions on movement, gatherings and internal borders, but the fireworks display over the Opera House and harbor bridge still went ahead.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian banned most people from going to Sydney’s downtown Thursday night.

“We don’t want to create any superspreading events on New Year’s Eve,” she said earlier this week, adding that watching the fireworks from home was the safest way to do so.

Melbourne, Australia’s second-most populous city, canceled its fireworks altogether this year.

Meanwhile, Australia's neighbor, New Zealand, saw its New Year celebrations go on largely as usual after the nation managed to curb local transmission of the virus.

Hong Kong usually sees raucous celebrations along the waterfront and in bar districts. For the second year running, however, New Year’s Eve fireworks were canceled, this time over the coronavirus rather than public security concerns.

In South Korea, the government shut down the beaches in Gangueng, on the country’s east coast, where people traditionally go to watch the first sunrise of the New Year. Seoul’s Bosingak bell-ringing ceremony was canceled for the first time since 1953, and instead viewed “virtually” on the city’s website.

As new coronavirus infections in Tokyo hit a record high of more than 1,300 Thursday, New Year’s Eve celebrations were curtailed. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged people to celebrate the occasion quietly and avoid nonessential outings.

Emperor Naruhito delivered a video message for the new year, instead of waving from a window with the imperial family as cheering crowds throng the palace.

New York is expected to hold a smaller than usual New Year’s Eve event, with the public banned from attending the celebrations and the ‘ball drop’ event livestreamed.

In Europe, celebrations will also be muted.

Germany banned the sale of fireworks, which residents usually set off in on the streets, and a pyrotechnics show at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate is off.

Fireworks over the River Thames in London were canceled as the government urged people to celebrate at home to contain soaring case numbers. However, Big Ben, which has been largely silent since 2017 while its clock tower is restored, sounded to mark the start of the new year and the end of Britain's transition out of the European Union.

The Netherlands moved the national countdown from an Amsterdam park to a soccer stadium, where spectators were not allowed in and pyrotechnics were replaced with “electric fireworks.”

France's interior minister said an extra 100,000 police officers were mobilized to enforce a 7 p.m. curfew and break up unauthorized gatherings of more than 10 people.

In Rome, customary concerts in public plazas were scrapped in favor of livestreamed performances and art installations.

Pope Francis skipped his typical Dec. 31 visit to the Vatican’s life-size Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square. But a planned New Year's Day blessing, which was to be delivered indoors to prevent crowds, was also canceled due to sciatica pain, the Vatican press office said.

In Russia, public events were banned or restricted in many regions, but traditional fireworks still took place in the capital's Red Square and throughout the city. While mass gatherings were banned and restaurants, clubs and ice rinks were shut Thursday night, they reopen Friday as Russians embark on weeklong festivities that span Orthodox Christmas.

Turkey declared a four-day lockdown starting New Year’s Eve, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that security forces will inspect hotels for illicit parties.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that direct deposit payments could appear any time from that night to next week. Paper checks were mailed out beginning Wednesday, Mnuchin said, for qualifying Americans who have not registered their banking information with the IRS.

Brittany Williams, 39, said she received $1,800 — $600 each for herself and her two sons, who are 6 and 8 years old.

""Having this little bit really puts me at ease,"" said Williams, who is a single mother. ""Just kind of gives me a second to breathe.""

Williams works at a marketing company based in Colorado, but she moved to Mukilteo, Washington, during the pandemic to be closer to her parents. She has had to rely on her savings account for many necessary expenses this year after she lost some of her clients because of Covid-19 economic struggles.

""It just helps me get a couple more Christmas presents under the tree for them that they weren't going to get this year because of my financial situation,"" Williams said.

She's using some of the extra cash to buy Lego blocks, which her sons love but which she wasn't able to afford this year.

""They're expensive,"" Williams said. ""They were not at the top of my able-to-do list this year, so I'm really excited to just give them a couple of things that they're really going to love and enjoy and spend quality time on.""

The $600 payments are part of the nearly $900 billion Covid-19 relief package that President Donald Trump signed into law Sunday after a multiday delay during which he urged legislators to send out $2,000 checks, instead. The Democratic-led House passed a bill Monday to greenlight the larger checks, but the legislation faces a grim future in the Republican-led Senate.

For now, individuals who made up to $75,000 in 2019 will get $600, with married couples who earned up to $150,000 getting $1,200. In addition, families will get an additional $600 for each dependent under 18 in the household.

Some Americans are using the extra cash to pay down credit card debt accrued as they struggled to find work.

Michelle Soto, 25, said she was part of the early layoffs to hit the tourism industry in Philadelphia. When she got her stimulus check Thursday, she immediately made a credit card payment.

Soto said she drained her savings account in the first months of the pandemic, trying to keep up with rent and student loan payments while unemployed. She lost her lease and was effectively homeless until she was able to move in with her mother in Minnesota.

""I'm trying to make sure that I am keeping my cat alive, keeping myself alive and trying not to default on any payments of any of the debts that I do have, and then trying to find a way to get health insurance before I turn 26,"" Soto said.

Her cat underwent surgery this year, which she also paid for with her credit card. Her storage unit, grocery bills and utilities are also draining her bank account dry. She has been receiving around $150 in weekly unemployment benefits, less than she did at the start of the pandemic, although that is also likely to increase because of the new relief bill.

Both women, like many other Americans, hope the Senate will approve the $2,000 checks.

""It's very clear how out of touch they are when they think that $600 will change anybody's life,"" Soto said.

""Judges from around the country report that, where jury trials have resumed, responses to jury summonses have met or exceeded their high hopes for the public's willingness to participate in the legal system during these very challenging times,"" Roberts said.

The pandemic forced courthouses nationwide to close in March, but by April, Roberts said, judges “were guiding critical court functions from their home offices — or their kitchen tables"" and were learning ""quickly or at least eventually"" to use audio and video conferencing tools.

The U.S. Supreme Court was among the adopters, canceling courtroom sittings in the spring and instead hearing oral argument by telephone conferences for the first time, a practice that continued when the court's new term began in October.

To accommodate jury trials, trial courts reconfigured spaces, repurposing large courtrooms to maintain social distancing and installing Plexiglas to keep participants physically separated. Judges in Michigan and Florida held drive-through naturalization ceremonies, and courts in Iowa and Minnesota moved theirs outdoors, he said.

Ordinary civil case filings were down 10 percent for the year, and 25 percent fewer defendants were charged with immigration offenses ""largely in response to a 70 percent reduction in defendants accused of improper entry,"" his report said.

Robert noted some of the history of the high court's responses to outbreaks, saying that America's first chief justice, John Jay, had to adjourn the young Supreme Court from sitting in Philadelphia in 1793 due to the yellow fever epidemic that killed 5,000 of the city's 50,000 residents. ""President Washington himself fell ill with a severe case of influenza"" three years earlier, the report said.

2020-12-31 22:18:03+00:00,38,"A large percentage of front-line workers in hospitals and nursing homes have refused to take the Covid-19 vaccine, a hurdle for public health officials as the country struggles to roll out inoculations around the country.

About 50 percent of front-line workers in California’s Riverside County have refused to take the vaccine, Riverside Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari told The Los Angeles Times on Thursday. California is currently overwhelmed with cases as hospital staff in Southern California face a shortage of intensive-care units and have created makeshift units.

Vaccine development and distribution has been the target of persistent conspiracy theories and disinformation on social media, although it's unclear how much impact this anti-vaccination movement has had on overall public trust in the process.

About 2 in 10 Americans are certain they will not change their mind about refusing the vaccine, according to data from the Pew Research Center. And 62 percent said they would be uncomfortable being among the first to receive the vaccine.

Anecdotally, an estimated 60 percent of Ohio nursing home employees have refused the vaccine already, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during a news briefing Wednesday. It's a stark contrast to the number of nursing home residents who have taken the vaccine when offered, which DeWine guessed to be about 85 percent.

“We’re not going to make them, but we wish we had a higher compliance,” DeWine said. “And our message today is: The train may not be coming back for awhile. We’re going to make it available to everyone eventually, but this is the opportunity for you, and you should really think about getting it.”

Rollout for the vaccine has already been met with several logistical hurdles as only 2.6 million people have been vaccinated as of Wednesday. A review by NBC News of earlier data Tuesday found that at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.

It’s unclear how refusal by essential workers, who are prioritized to receive the vaccine in the first phase of administration, could further hamper the distribution efforts.

A survey of 2,053 New York City firefighters found that more than half said they would refuse the Covid-19 vaccine when it became available to them, according to a poll released by the Uniformed Firefighters Association this month.

Some of those firefighters may overlap with those who have already contracted the coronavirus and don’t believe they need to get the inoculation, Andy Ansbro, the union president, said.

""As a union we are encouraging our members to get the vaccine, but we are defending their right to make that choice,"" Ansbro said. ""I personally feel this vaccine is safe, I've done my own research, I will be getting the vaccine and I will be encouraging other members to do so. In the end, it is their own personal choice.""

Ansboro was among the many essential workers who received the vaccine, according to a photo posted by the UFA on Tuesday. The FDNY reported that 1,000 members had been vaccinated by Tuesday.

A number of politicians, public health officials and front-line workers have taken the vaccine publicly to assert confidence in the shots, including leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President Mike Pence.

Intensive care unit nurse Sandra Linsdsay was among the first in the country to receive the vaccine, telling reporters that she felt “relieved” afterward.

“I feel the healing is coming,” Linsdsay said. “I hope this marks the beginning of the end of the very painful time in our history.""",MSNBC,"['struggles', 'rollout', 'frontline', 'nursing', 'public', 'health', 'distribution', 'firefighters', 'vaccines', 'receive', 'refuse', 'vaccine', 'refused', 'workers', 'members', 'covid']",0

2020-12-31 21:16:04+00:00,62,"The Texas AG sued the city of Austin on Wednesday after local officials placed new Covid-19 restrictions on dining services for the New Year’s weekend.

Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, filed a petition for temporary injunction and a temporary restraining order in Travis County District Court against the directive, which limited restaurants to drive-thru, curbside pickup, takeout, and delivery services between 10:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. from Thursday to Sunday.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Andy Brown, both Democrats, introduced the new four-day restriction to limit social gatherings over the holiday weekend after the state reported a record number of hospitalizations and new cases.

In a letter on Wednesday, Paxton said the new directive violated a previous order by Gov. Greg Abbott and directed both officials to rescind or modify the order.

“Mayor Adler and Judge Brown do not have the authority to flout Gov. Abbott’s executive orders by shutting down businesses in Travis County and our state’s capital city,” Paxton said in a statement. “The fact that these two local leaders released their orders at night and on the eve of a major holiday shows how much contempt they have for Texans and local businesses.""

Paxton's lawsuit names Adler, Brown, the city of Austin and Travis County as defendants.

Adler said on Wednesday he consulted with doctors, educators and city attorneys, calling the city of Austin in “critical” condition.

“We are now facing our most dangerous surge prospects,” he said during a news conference.

Brown called the order “the most narrowly tailored thing we could think of” to curb the spread of the coronavirus over New Year’s weekend.

Dr. Mark Escott, medical director of the city of Austin and Travis County, urged residents to “stay home as much as possible and not gather with people outside their households.”

“We are now experiencing uncontrolled widespread community transmission of COVID-19, particularly in circumstances where masking and distancing are not possible, making bars and similar establishments extremely concerning over this holiday weekend,” Escott said in a statement.

Texas logged a record of almost 12,000 hospitalizations and 27,000 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, according to the state health department’s Covid-19 dashboard.

“There is a learning curve,” Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday.

“There were a number of days that were ‘lost’ because of the holidays or snowstorms,” he said.

As of Wednesday, about 2.6 million people — most of them front-line health care workers and some nursing home residents — have received their first shots of the 14 million doses that were delivered this month, according to the administration. A review by NBC News of earlier data Tuesday found that at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.

The administration in September vowed that 100 million doses would be shipped by the end of the year. This month, Slaoui cut the projection to 20 million.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Slaoui and Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said on Wednesday’s call that they weren’t satisfied with the numbers they had seen so far of vaccines administered.

“We agree that that number is lower than what we hoped for,” Slaoui said.

But, they said, they expected the pace of patients getting the vaccines to pick up.

“Vaccine uptake starts out a little slow, but then increases exponentially and very rapidly,” Perna said. “It’s been 12 days, two holidays, three major snowstorms.”

“Every day, everybody gets better, and I believe uptake will increase significantly as we go forward,” he added. He said he expected to see improvement in vaccine administration by mid-January.

The officials said that the federal government and vaccine makers had delivered 14 million doses to the states. On a separate conference call Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 2.6 million people had received the shots so far, including people in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

While the federal government has helped to coordinate the distribution of vaccine doses from manufacturers to the states, the coordination of administrating the vaccines has fallen to the states, many of which have been short on money, staff and other resources to smoothly schedule and give doses.

Slaoui, the former head of the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccines division, said the government welcomed more help if people wanted to offer it.

“Come to the table, put your sleeves up, and help us with specific ideas,” he said. “We welcome very much any input, but it needs to be specific and actionable.”

They said the government had so far enrolled 70,000 health care providers including doctor’s offices, hospitals and pharmacies as eligible to administer the vaccine. “As vaccines become available in pharmacies, it’s going to be more straightforward” for people to get them, Slaoui said.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Perna said another reason for the low number of vaccines administered was that officials had set aside some for CVS and Walgreens to use at long-term care facilities. “That does contribute to part of the lag, and it could be a significant number — a couple hundred million, for sure,” he said.

Slaoui said the slow pace of vaccines would not affect the government’s timeline for broad public access to vaccines by April.

2020-12-31 09:02:03+00:00,64,"Two states, Colorado and California, have confirmed cases of a highly contagious Covid-19 variant first detected in the United Kingdom.

Officials announced Wednesday that the strain was found in a San Diego patient, hours after Colorado officials revealed that the first confirmed case in the U.S. is a member of the state National Guard.

""I'm not surprised that you have a case, and likely more cases, in California,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told Gov. Gavin Newsom in a video call after the announcement. ""We likely will be seeing reports from other states.""

The patient in California with the variant, sometimes called strain B.1.1.7, is a San Diego man with no travel history outside of the U.S. who developed symptoms on Sunday and was tested Tuesday, San Diego County health officials said. He was isolated but not hospitalized.

The variant is believed to be more transmissible, ""but there's no indication at all that it increases the virulence — and by virulence I mean the ability to make you sick or kill you,"" Fauci said.

The member of the Colorado National Guard found with the strain had been deployed to a nursing home dealing with a coronavirus outbreak.

A second member of the six-person National Guard contingent dispatched to the Good Samaritan Society facility in the town of Simla is also suspected of having contracted the variant, Colorado state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said during a virtual update.

“We have one confirmed and one possible case of the variant in the state,” she said. “And we have deployed a team to the facility.”

They were part of a contingent of six members of the National Guard who arrived Dec. 23 at the facility about 45 miles northeast of Colorado Springs, Herlihy said. Their infections were discovered after they were tested Christmas Eve.

“In Simla, they were deployed to help deal with staff shortages after an outbreak that affected 100 percent of the residents in the facility,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said.

Now both patients, neither of whom live in Simla, are in isolation as contact tracers are trying to determine where, when and how they got infected with the variant, Herlihy said.

Neither patient, who were both identified earlier as men by Elbert County Health Director Dwayne Smith, have a recent history of traveling outside the country, Herlihy said.

In other coronavirus news:

The mutation detected in Colorado and California has also been identified in more than a dozen countries, including France, Denmark, Japan, South Korea and Canada.

But because there is no widespread effort in the U.S. to conduct regular genome sequencing of samples from across the country, it's likely that the variant is already spreading here, Dr. Diane Griffin, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told NBC News on Tuesday.

The silver lining? The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines for Covid-19 should be effective against the new variant.

""Our working assumption from all the scientists is that the vaccine response should be adequate for this virus,"" Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said earlier this month.

Nearly 19.7 million cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic and the virus has claimed more than 341,000 lives, according to the latest NBC News data.

Housed in what was once a local hospital and home to about 25 residents, the Good Samaritan Society facility in Simla is in the midst of an outbreak of Covid-19 cases and so far there have been two confirmed coronavirus fatalities, a 93-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman, officials have said.

The facility caters mostly to people from the eastern plains of Colorado and got a top rating in 2009 in a U.S. News & World Report survey of 15,500 of the nation's nursing homes.

But in May, state health department inspectors noted that the facility “failed to establish and maintain an infection control program,” although it rated the potential level of harm to residents as minimal.

Luke Letlow, a Republican, was elected to represent Louisiana's 5th Congressional District in a runoff this month.

A spokesman, Andrew Bautsch, confirmed Letlow's death at Ochsner-LSU Health Shreveport on Letlow's Facebook page.

""The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,"" Bautsch said in a statement. ""A statement from the family along with funeral arrangements will be announced at a later time.""

Letlow is survived by his wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, and two young children, Bautsch said.

He died less than a week before the new Congress is to be sworn in on Jan. 3.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards urged people in the state to pray for Letlow's family, and he will order flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of his funeral.

Letlow announced Dec. 18 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and tweeted days later that he was being treated at a hospital. On Wednesday, his representative said he had been transferred to another hospital, where he was stable in the intensive care unit.

Louisiana's congressional delegation, including House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, said in a statement that ""we are devastated to hear of Luke Letlow's passing.""

""Luke had such a positive spirit, and a tremendously bright future ahead of him,"" the delegation of representatives and senators said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted: ""Our hearts break tonight as we process the news of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow's passing.""

Letlow also worked for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who tweeted that he and his wife, Supriya, were heartbroken.

""Luke has been a good friend for so many years, and we are saddened he was taken from us at such a young age,"" Jindal wrote. ""We had talked in recent days about his excitement about the opportunity to serve the people of the 5th Congressional district, and his love and devotion for Julia and their kids.""

""I first met Luke when he was still a college student, and spent countless hours with him in his truck driving the back roads of Louisiana,"" Jindal wrote. ""His passion for service has been a constant throughout his life.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement: ""Tonight, the United States House of Representatives sadly mourns the passing of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow.""

Letlow beat fellow Republican Lance Harris in a runoff election this month, 62 percent to 38 percent, according to the secretary of state's website.

He was chief of staff for Rep. Ralph Abraham, whom he was elected to succeed in Congress, Edwards said. Abraham announced that he was not running for re-election in February.

There have been 304,000 confirmed or probable Covid-19 cases in Louisiana and almost 7,400 deaths, according to the state Health Department.

Nationwide, there have been more than 19.5 million cases, with more than 338,000 deaths, according to an NBC News count of reports.

A spokesman for Edwards said he will call for a special election to fill the seat, which will coincide with the election to fill Rep. Cedric Richmond's seat as the Louisiana Democrat, who also tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month, is joining President-elect Joe Biden's administration.

As of Wednesday, about 2.6 million people — most of them front-line health care workers and some nursing home residents — have received their first shots of the 14 million doses that were delivered this month, according to the administration. A review by NBC News of earlier data Tuesday found that at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.

The administration in September vowed that 100 million doses would be shipped by the end of the year. This month, Slaoui cut the projection to 20 million.

Slaoui and Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said on Wednesday’s call that they weren’t satisfied with the numbers they had seen so far of vaccines administered.

“We agree that that number is lower than what we hoped for,” Slaoui said.

But, they said, they expected the pace of patients getting the vaccines to pick up.

“Vaccine uptake starts out a little slow, but then increases exponentially and very rapidly,” Perna said. “It’s been 12 days, two holidays, three major snowstorms.”

“Every day, everybody gets better, and I believe uptake will increase significantly as we go forward,” he added. He said he expected to see improvement in vaccine administration by mid-January.

The officials said that the federal government and vaccine makers had delivered 14 million doses to the states. On a separate conference call Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 2.6 million people had received the shots so far, including people in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

While the federal government has helped to coordinate the distribution of vaccine doses from manufacturers to the states, the coordination of administrating the vaccines has fallen to the states, many of which have been short on money, staff and other resources to smoothly schedule and give doses.

Slaoui, the former head of the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccines division, said the government welcomed more help if people wanted to offer it.

“Come to the table, put your sleeves up, and help us with specific ideas,” he said. “We welcome very much any input, but it needs to be specific and actionable.”

They said the government had so far enrolled 70,000 health care providers including doctor’s offices, hospitals and pharmacies as eligible to administer the vaccine. “As vaccines become available in pharmacies, it’s going to be more straightforward” for people to get them, Slaoui said.

Perna said another reason for the low number of vaccines administered was that officials had set aside some for CVS and Walgreens to use at long-term care facilities. “That does contribute to part of the lag, and it could be a significant number — a couple hundred million, for sure,” he said.

Slaoui said the slow pace of vaccines would not affect the government’s timeline for broad public access to vaccines by April.

2020-12-30 21:40:04+00:00,34,"A condemned Ohio inmate, who survived an executioner's needle more than a decade ago, has died — probably from complications of Covid-19, officials said Wednesday.

Romell Broom, a 64-year-old convicted murderer, passed away on Monday at Franklin Medical Center, according to Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman Sara French.

The state of Ohio says at least 124 inmates have died from confirmed or probable cases of coronavirus, as it continues to ravage the nation.

""As of today, his death is considered a probable Covid-19 related death, pending his death certificate,"" French said in a statement.

Back in Sept. 15, 2009, Broom, then 53, was set to be put to death, but executioners couldn't find a suitable vein that could be used for his lethal injection.

The execution was finally put off after Broom was stuck by needles 18 times over two hours.

He was set again for execution on March 16, 2022.

""We are sorry that he is gone and sorry that he lived his last days on death row,"" Broom's lawyer Adele Shank said in a statement on behalf of her and the inmate's other attorney, Tim Sweeney.

""Due to a painful and traumatic botched execution procedure, Broom survived that day only to live with the ever-increasing fear and distress that the same process would be used on him at his next execution date.""

They added: ""Let his passing in this way, and not in the execution chamber, be the final word on whether a second attempt should ever have been considered.""

Broom was convicted for the 1984 murder and rape of Tryna Middleton, 14, who was kidnapped as she walked home from a football game with two friends.

Ohio is currently working under a de facto moratorium against capital punishment as the state is unable to obtain the drugs needed for lethal injection. Gov. Mike DeWine has said lawmakers must find a new execution method.

A handful of prisoners have survived executions.

Willie Francis, 17, was supposed to be put to death in Louisiana on May 3, 1946 but the electric chair was improperly set up, sending painful — but not fatal — currents through this body. Executors tried again on May 9, 1947, and the 18-year-old was killed.

Ohio executioners failed to kill Alva Campbell on Nov. 15, 2017 when they couldn't find a suitable vein. The 69-year-old, who had smoked for decades and suffered from a host of health issues, died in custody less than four months later.

Luke Letlow, a Republican, was elected to represent Louisiana's 5th Congressional District in a runoff this month.

A spokesman, Andrew Bautsch, confirmed Letlow's death at Ochsner-LSU Health Shreveport on Letlow's Facebook page.

""The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,"" Bautsch said in a statement. ""A statement from the family along with funeral arrangements will be announced at a later time.""

Letlow is survived by his wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, and two young children, Bautsch said.

He died less than a week before the new Congress is to be sworn in on Jan. 3.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards urged people in the state to pray for Letlow's family, and he will order flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of his funeral.

Letlow announced Dec. 18 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and tweeted days later that he was being treated at a hospital. On Wednesday, his representative said he had been transferred to another hospital, where he was stable in the intensive care unit.

Louisiana's congressional delegation, including House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, said in a statement that ""we are devastated to hear of Luke Letlow's passing.""

""Luke had such a positive spirit, and a tremendously bright future ahead of him,"" the delegation of representatives and senators said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted: ""Our hearts break tonight as we process the news of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow's passing.""

Letlow also worked for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who tweeted that he and his wife, Supriya, were heartbroken.

""Luke has been a good friend for so many years, and we are saddened he was taken from us at such a young age,"" Jindal wrote. ""We had talked in recent days about his excitement about the opportunity to serve the people of the 5th Congressional district, and his love and devotion for Julia and their kids.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement: ""Tonight, the United States House of Representatives sadly mourns the passing of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow.""

Letlow beat fellow Republican Lance Harris in a runoff election this month, 62 percent to 38 percent, according to the secretary of state's website.

He was chief of staff for Rep. Ralph Abraham, whom he was elected to succeed in Congress, Edwards said. Abraham announced that he was not running for re-election in February.

There have been 304,000 confirmed or probable Covid-19 cases in Louisiana and almost 7,400 deaths, according to the state Health Department.

Nationwide, there have been more than 19.5 million cases, with more than 338,000 deaths, according to an NBC News count of reports.

A spokesman for Edwards said he will call for a special election to fill the seat, which will coincide with the election to fill Rep. Cedric Richmond's seat as the Louisiana Democrat, who also tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month, is joining President-elect Joe Biden's administration.

He said that beginning later this week, people expecting to receive payments can check their statuses at its Get My Payment page.

Mnuchin said the Treasury Department and the IRS were ""working with unprecedented speed"" to get the checks out. ""These payments are an integral part of our commitment to providing vital additional economic relief to the American people during this unprecedented time,"" he said in a statement.

Under the terms in the bill, individuals who made up to $75,000 in 2019 will get up to $600. Married couples who earned up to $150,000 will get up to $1,200. Filers listed as ""head of household"" who earned $112,500 or less will also get up to $600. Families will also get an additional $600 — up from $500 in the spring — for each dependent under 18 years old in their households.

Senate Democrats failed earlier in the day in their bid to quickly increase the payments to $2,000 — which President Donald Trump has been urging.

""$600 IS NOT ENOUGH!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday.

Trump began complaining about the size of the direct payment checks after Congress signed off on them as part of a $900 billion Covid-19 relief package last week.

Mnuchin proposed the $600 checks and negotiated the stimulus package on Trump's behalf with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle.

Trump's complaints led him to drag his heels in signing the bill, resulting in the temporary lapse of some unemployment benefits. Trump relented and signed Sunday, but he maintained his call to up the payments.

A hospital in Los Angeles turned its chapel into an overflow unit. Ghaly said that wait times have been much longer than normal in some emergency departments and that hospitals are using post- and pre-operation beds to care for Covid-19 and other patients, among other steps.

Gov. Gavin Newsom warned Monday that travel during the last holiday week made it all but inevitable that the state would have a ""surge on top of a surge.""

Most of the state is under regional stay-at-home orders that have required some businesses, like bars, wineries and hair salons, to close and have reduced capacity in others — the requirements kick in once a region's intensive care capacity falls below 15 percent.

Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley remained at zero percent ICU availability Tuesday, which means not that there are no beds but that hospitals have had to go to surge capacity. The orders were extended into 2021 and will remain in place until projections show that the ICU threshold is reached.

2020-12-29 23:32:06+00:00,79,"The United States on Tuesday reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 from a variant of the coronavirus that is thought to have emerged from the United Kingdom, a fresh cause for concern as new research has found it to be more contagious than other strains.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced that the state identified the case in a man in his 20s with no recent travel history. It's the first known infection from the newly identified strain in the U.S., and most experts say it's likely that more will follow.

""There is a lot we don't know about this new Covid-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,"" Polis said Tuesday in a news briefing.

It's not uncommon for viruses to mutate, and, indeed, several other variants of the coronavirus have already been reported. But until now, most of the mutations didn't have significant impacts on how the virus spreads or how sick infected people became.

The new variant, dubbed VUI-202012/01, has been found to have a handful of mutations in its genetic code. Notably, it ""has been predicted that these changes have the potential to make the virus more rapidly transmissible,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Many hospitals in the U.S. are already in crisis. The worry is that a more contagious variant of the virus could increase the number of new cases and put even more pressure on the health care system.

""If you have twice as many cases, then even if the amount of people who are sick is the same rate as it is currently, that would definitely be bad,"" said Dr. Diane Griffin, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Anything that increases the number of cases would be bad.""

The new variant has been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including France, Denmark, Japan, South Korea and Canada. But because there is no widespread effort in the U.S. to conduct regular genome sequencing of samples from across the country, it's likely that the variant is already spreading in the U.S., Griffin said.

""I'm sure it's already spreading here and we just don't know it yet,"" said Griffin, who called for better monitoring of the virus's evolution as part of a committee for the National Academy of Sciences. ""That's the reason we really tried to push the U.S. to have a better surveillance system, so that we are constantly monitoring what the virus is doing here and so that we would see when a new version arrived.""

Scientists in the U.K. are conducting that type of forensic work now.

A new report from the country's Department of Health and Social Care found that the newly identified variant doesn't appear to be more deadly and doesn't cause more severe illness.

Although the findings provide some relief, experts say that because the new variant is more contagious, there is still an acute risk of health care systems' becoming overwhelmed in the coming weeks and months.

""One of the mutations that has been identified is known to increase the ability of the virus to bind to its receptor,"" Griffin said. ""So it makes some sense that it would be more transmissible.""

The new report, published by Public Health England, found that variant cases weren't at increased risk of reinfection and didn't have a greater case fatality rate. The study compared 3,538 Covid-19 cases, of which nearly 2,700 were identified through genome sequencing as involving the new coronavirus variant.

Severity of the disease and death aren't the only causes for concern for countries that are battling severe outbreaks of infection, like the U.K. If the virus can now spread faster through communities, for instance, more hospitalizations and deaths will naturally follow.

More research is needed, but the new variant's increased transmissibility could mean its so-called reproduction number has changed. That figure, called R-naught, is an estimate of the average number of people one Covid-19 patient is likely to infect, and it is used to represent how contagious a disease is.

Seemingly tiny changes to the reproduction number — R-naught increasing from 1.1 to 1.3, for example — can amount to big increases in potential infections because of how pathogens spread.

""An increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity),"" Adam Kucharski, a mathematician and epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, wrote on Twitter.

It's estimated that the new variant could be anywhere from 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible, but more research is needed to understand why.

Another big unknown is what impact the new variant will have on immunity, if any. There is no evidence yet to suggest that the same antibodies that recognize the virus won't also work against the new variant, but it's the kind of development that keeps epidemiologists on edge.

""One of the things we're concerned about is does this change the efficacy of the vaccine?"" Griffin said. ""We don't have evidence that this mutation does that, but when viruses mutate, we're always worried about what it means for immunity or becoming resistant to drugs.""

A separate coronavirus variant reported in South Africa is similarly thought to be more contagious, but research is still underway to better understand its characteristics.

""Lab studies take time, and we expect more info on both in the coming days and weeks,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Monday in a news briefing about the newly identified variants.

While scientists race to uncover more details about the new variants, experts say it's more important than ever to follow public health guidelines.

""All of the things we've been saying — wear a mask, practice social distancing and avoid mixing households — those mitigation strategies will continue to work,"" Griffin said.

2020-12-29 19:21:04+00:00,31,"Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia said Tuesday that they support increasing direct Covid-19 relief payments to $2,000, caving in to pressure from Democrats and President Donald Trump as they fight to hold onto their seats in the competitive January runoff races.

""I have stood by the president 100 percent of the time. I am proud to do that. And I've said: Absolutely, we need to get relief to Americans now, and I will support that,"" Loeffler said when asked about direct payments in an interview with Fox News.

In a Fox News interview later Tuesday, Perdue said he was ""delighted to support the president in this $2,000 — it's really a $1,400 increment over what we've already done, and I think with a vaccine coming, I think this is absolutely appropriate. So I fully support what the president is doing right now.""

The Democratic-controlled House narrowly passed a bill Monday evening to increase direct coronavirus relief payments, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky., blocked an attempt by Senate Democrats to approve the measure. Support from Loeffler and Perdue could put pressure on McConnell to take it up again later in the week.

Perdue and Loeffler are spending Tuesday campaigning in Georgia and weren't on Capitol Hill.

Loeffler had previously declined to take a firm position when pressed by reporters, and Perdue had been quiet on the issue, although he was critical of the direct payments during the first round of Covid-19 relief this year.

Trump signed the $2.3 trillion government funding and coronavirus relief package Monday after weeks of attacks from Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock over Congress' inability to pass more coronavirus aid.

The aid should have come as a relief to Loeffler and Perdue. Instead, they faced new criticism from their opponents as they weighed whether to join Democrats and Trump in providing more money or stick with party leaders in opposition.

""I have not heard a peep from Perdue,"" Ossoff, who is running against him, said in an interview Monday night with MSNBC's Joy Reid.

""I am calling on Sen. Perdue to reverse his opposition to $2,000 relief checks. Look, President-elect Biden, President Trump and Democrats all support this policy to get money into the pockets of hardworking Americans who are in dire straights right now, and Sen. Perdue needs to come out tonight and commit to voting on the floor of the Senate for $2,000 relief checks.""

Ossoff criticized Perdue's support for the checks as ""politically convenient,"" adding in a statement that Perdue ""hasn't had a change of heart — he's exclusively focused on his own political survival.""

Warnock, who is running against Loeffler, tweeted Monday that ""Georgians could have gotten $2,000 relief checks"" but that Loeffler ""refused to fight for more.""

Warnock also accused Loeffler of having taken too long to act, saying, ""Georgians learned long ago they can't trust Kelly Loeffler to look out for anyone but herself.""

It's unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate for the $2,000 checks, which would require at least 12 Republicans to vote for the measure.

Along with Perdue and Loeffler, Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have indicated that they are open to voting to increase the checks.

While McConnell has been against direct checks in the past, he was persuaded to support the $600 payments in the bill passed last week in part out of concern that failing to do so would hurt Republicans in the Georgia runoffs.

More than 2 million Georgians have voted early ahead of the Jan. 5 elections, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.

The woman, Dr. Susan Moore, 52, of Indianapolis, said she tested positive for Covid-19 on Nov. 29 and was hospitalized at Indiana University Health North. She documented her tumultuous stay in a Dec. 4 Facebook post, which included video recorded from her hospital bed. The video, about 7 minutes long, detailed her complaints and dissatisfaction with how staff members were treating her, which she believed was because she was Black.

""You have to show proof that you have something wrong with you in order for you to get the medicine,"" Moore said in the impassioned video. ""I put forth, and I maintain, that if I was white, I wouldn't have to go through that.""

A number of her peers on social media agreed.

""These are the issues we face, as we give up so much to take care of patients, even in harm's way, and when we find ourselves as patients, we are disrespected, devalued & dismissed,"" Dr. Omolara Uwemedimo tweeted. ""It cost Dr. Moore her life. Her medical degree did not save her from the racism that she endured while battling for her life.""

In an opinion article published in The Washington Post, four advocates for racial justice in health care said Moore's death resulted from a biased system.

""No matter how well-intentioned our health-care system is, it has not rooted out the false idea of a hierarchy of human valuation based on skin color and the falser idea that, if there were such a hierarchy, 'White' people would be at the top,"" said the piece by Dr. Aletha Maybank, chief health equity officer at the American Medical Association; Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, a family physician and epidemiologist and past president of the American Public Health Association; Dr. Uché Blackstock, founder and CEO of Advancing Health Equity; and Dr. Joia Crear Perry, president of the National Birth Equity Collaborative.

Moore said that throughout her stay, her doctor was not receptive to her concerns and routinely downplayed her pain. Only after she underwent a CT scan, which allowed hospital personnel to see Moore's lungs for themselves, did the doctor agree to prescribe her the narcotics she needed, Moore said.

In the Facebook post, which she kept updated, Moore chronicled her discharge from the hospital, her return home and the worsening of her condition.

""I was home for less than 12 hours. Spiked a temperature of 103 and my blood pressure plummeted to 80/60 with a heart rate of 132,"" Moore wrote. ""I'm back in the hospital, a different hospital Saint Vincent Carmel.""

Moore said that she was diagnosed with pneumonia but that she was receiving ""compassionate care"" and the pain medication she needed at her new hospital.

In her last update, Moore said she was being transferred to intensive care. She died Dec. 20, according to news reports.

A spokesperson for Indiana University Health North would not comment about Moore's allegations specifically but said, ""We are very sad to hear of her passing,"" and shared the following statement on behalf of the hospital:

""IU North respects and upholds patient privacy and cannot comment on a specific patient, their medical history or conditions. As an organization committed to equity and reducing racial disparities in healthcare, we take accusations of discrimination very seriously and investigate every allegation.

2020-12-28 23:05:05+00:00,56,"Despite the rollout of two new vaccines, the pandemic is accelerating and the United States should brace itself for “one of the worst months in this nation’s history in January,” one of President-elect Joe Biden’s top Covid-19 advisers warned Monday.

“There is no doubt about that,” the expert, Dr. Celine Gounder, said on CNBC. “That cake is in the oven already, with the travel that has happened over the holidays.”

That dire warning came as the number of Covid-19 infections rose past 19.2 million after Christmas and the number of deaths from coronavirus neared 334,000, the latest NBC News data showed.

Gounder, a member of the Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, described a nightmarish scenario in which local health officials are forced to erect field hospitals because hallways and even some parking lots are already packed with sick patients.

And an even bigger crisis, Gounder said, will be finding enough doctors and nurses to treat everybody.

“You can't stand up new doctors and nurses the way you can field hospitals,” Gounder said. “You can't just create them out of thin air.”

In other coronavirus developments:

While more than a million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have already been administered in the last week and a third vaccine from Novavax is in the late stages of development, Gounder said the pace needs to be ramped-up to a million shots a day to stop the pandemic.

“It's not just about the vaccines,” Gounder said. “You have to also get the vaccines distributed and you need staff to administer the vaccines. And when staff are all tied up in ICUs that are overflowing with sick patients, it's very difficult to siphon off those staff away to do vaccination.”

That’s already the sad reality in Southern California, said Dr. Brad Spellberg, the chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, on MSNBC on Monday.

Spellberg said his hospital’s intensive care unit has been full “for going on three weeks,” and it struggles every day to find enough nurses to take care of all of its patients.

“You can't snap your fingers and will those people into existence,” Spellberg said. “As patients flood the hospital, there’s only so many of those people to go around.”

The incoming Biden administration intends to invoke the Defense Production Act to make sure there are enough “raw materials for the vaccines” and personal protective equipment, to increase testing and to employ genetic surveillance to detect new strains of Covid-19, Gounder said.

“I think it is going to be a massive operational challenge, probably the biggest this country has ever had to undertake to vaccinate all of its citizens in a timely fashion,” Gounder said. “In the last two weeks, we basically averaged about a million doses of vaccine administered per week. We need to be getting to a million doses per day.”

In the meantime, Gounder said, because so many Americans traveled and gathered for Christmas despite the numerous warnings from health experts that this was a sure-fire way of spreading the coronavirus, “we’re going to see another surge just like we did after Thanksgiving.”

The federal Transportation Security Administration screened 1,284,599 travelers at U.S. airports on Sunday, the most since the pandemic was declared in March.

“We’re going to see another surge in January, and hospitals are going to be facing that when they’re already full,” Gounder said. “We already have patients being treated in hallways, in parking lots.”

Gounder said the Biden administration also intends to increase surveillance of the new Covid-19 mutations that have already sickened people in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

“We did not do that routinely,” Gounder said. “We have the technology. We just chose not to spend the money on that kind of public health surveillance.”",MSNBC,"['warns', 'worst', 'adviser', 'gounder', 'going', 'covid19', 'hospitals', 'biden', 'coronavirus', 'patients', 'surveillance', 'vaccines', 'surge', 'million', 'postchristmas', 'staff', 'covid']",0

At the same time, news of possible mishandling of vaccine distribution, as recently reported in New York City urgent care centers, shows how important it is to be vigilant and press lawmakers and public health officials to be transparent in their distribution strategies and to hold them accountable for their decisions.

The lack of any federal strategy has left every state, county and tribal territory to their own devices.

Since the approval and rollout of the vaccine, America has watched the painfully paradoxical images of boxes of vaccines being unloaded from distribution trucks alongside FEMA-operated refrigerated morgue trailers parked at hospitals. In the same building, health care workers have literally been receiving a shot in the arm that could save their lives within hours of pronouncing a patient dead.

Still, the lack of any federal strategy has left every state, county and tribal territory to their own devices, to identify strategies and submit plans for their respective distribution process.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent agency, has made recommendations that identify the high priority groups: 1A encompasses health care personnel and long-term care residents; and 1B adults over the age of 75 and front-line essential workers (such as first responders, police, educators, U.S. Postal Service workers, corrections officers and others).

But a review of the various states’ vaccination plans reveals that many states are not following the ACIP recommendations and that there is a degree of variability that could have significant impact and create more confusion than comprehension. For example, Arkansas has long-term care facilities in their second phase, after health care workers and other essential workers, despite over 100,000 long-term care residents and staff who have died from Covid-19.

Maryland has teachers and day care operators in the second phase, behind other essential personnel, potentially extending school closures and creating tension between parents who must work and the teachers and day care providers who want to be safe while caring for students. The state of Texas has also deviated from the ACIP recommendations and prioritized people over the age of 65 as well as those over the age of 16 with certain chronic conditions.

The rationale behind these variations can appear sound and reasonable; for example, trying to prioritize people with chronic conditions seems compelling, since rates of death from Covid-19 were 12 times higher in people with chronic conditions compared to those without diabetes, heart disease or cancer. But it is also highly likely that people with such conditions are able to take precautions and avoid high-risk situations.

Ethnic minorities comprise a significant number of essential workers, which only exacerbates the ongoing health disparities uncovered by Covid-19.

Essential workers, particularly front-line workers such as public transit operators, postal carriers, teachers and food supply workers, are critical to the prospects of preserving essential services and are at incredibly high risk, often without any high quality personal protective equipment or an ability to practice social distancing. Further, ethnic minorities comprise a significant number of essential workers, which only exacerbates the ongoing health disparities uncovered by Covid-19.

The goal of any vaccine distribution strategy is to balance societal need, and ethics and science and allow for flexibility to make decisions like the ones Texas, Maryland and Arkansas have had to make. But when a pandemic of this nature has gripped the world, wielding death and destruction without limits, ushering many of us into the quiet corners of our homes in isolation and fear, the demand for a vaccine is inextricably linked with a sense of fairness and equity.

Even as a physician who works in a clinic setting, I have no problem waiting my turn after my higher-risk colleagues in the hospitals receive their vaccines. Images of members of Congress who downplayed the impact of the virus now receiving the vaccine feel like a slap in the face. Continuity of government seems meaningless when that same government delays a stimulus package and promotes protests against stay-at-home orders and mask mandates.

Continuity of government seems meaningless when that same government delays a stimulus package and promotes protests against stay-at-home orders and mask mandates.

Fast forward 30 days from now when simply crossing state lines can make the difference in whether you receive the vaccine or not. As thousands of people continue to die each day and millions more Americans contract Covid-19, even a one-week delay can feel like an eternity. In the beginning, demand will far outstrip supply, and there will no doubt be an underground market of sorts to try to access the vaccine early.

While we are still trying to navigate the uncharted waters of the pandemic, we have unfortunately become accustomed to expecting the worst and witnessing inequities often wielded by a callous president and his inner circle.

2020-12-28 15:16:04+00:00,46,"In America and in the rest of the world, nonessential, lower-risk people and the public wait for their turn to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. At the same time, news of possible mishandling of vaccine distribution, as recently reported in New York City urgent care centers, shows how important it is to be vigilant and press lawmakers and public health officials to be transparent in their distribution strategies and to hold them accountable for their decisions.

The lack of any federal strategy has left every state, county and tribal territory to their own devices.

Since the approval and rollout of the vaccine, America has watched the painfully paradoxical images of boxes of vaccines being unloaded from distribution trucks alongside FEMA-operated refrigerated morgue trailers parked at hospitals. In the same building, health care workers have literally been receiving a shot in the arm that could save their lives within hours of pronouncing a patient dead.

Still, the lack of any federal strategy has left every state, county and tribal territory to their own devices, to identify strategies and submit plans for their respective distribution process.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent agency, has made recommendations that identify the high priority groups: 1A encompasses health care personnel and long-term care residents; and 1B adults over the age of 75 and front-line essential workers (such as first responders, police, educators, U.S. Postal Service workers, corrections officers and others).

But a review of the various states’ vaccination plans reveals that many states are not following the ACIP recommendations and that there is a degree of variability that could have significant impact and create more confusion than comprehension. For example, Arkansas has long-term care facilities in their second phase, after health care workers and other essential workers, despite over 100,000 long-term care residents and staff who have died from Covid-19.

Maryland has teachers and day care operators in the second phase, behind other essential personnel, potentially extending school closures and creating tension between parents who must work and the teachers and day care providers who want to be safe while caring for students. The state of Texas has also deviated from the ACIP recommendations and prioritized people over the age of 65 as well as those over the age of 16 with certain chronic conditions.

The rationale behind these variations can appear sound and reasonable; for example, trying to prioritize people with chronic conditions seems compelling, since rates of death from Covid-19 were 12 times higher in people with chronic conditions compared to those without diabetes, heart disease or cancer. But it is also highly likely that people with such conditions are able to take precautions and avoid high-risk situations.

Ethnic minorities comprise a significant number of essential workers, which only exacerbates the ongoing health disparities uncovered by Covid-19.

Essential workers, particularly front-line workers such as public transit operators, postal carriers, teachers and food supply workers, are critical to the prospects of preserving essential services and are at incredibly high risk, often without any high quality personal protective equipment or an ability to practice social distancing. Further, ethnic minorities comprise a significant number of essential workers, which only exacerbates the ongoing health disparities uncovered by Covid-19.

The goal of any vaccine distribution strategy is to balance societal need, and ethics and science and allow for flexibility to make decisions like the ones Texas, Maryland and Arkansas have had to make. But when a pandemic of this nature has gripped the world, wielding death and destruction without limits, ushering many of us into the quiet corners of our homes in isolation and fear, the demand for a vaccine is inextricably linked with a sense of fairness and equity.

Even as a physician who works in a clinic setting, I have no problem waiting my turn after my higher-risk colleagues in the hospitals receive their vaccines. Images of members of Congress who downplayed the impact of the virus now receiving the vaccine feel like a slap in the face. Continuity of government seems meaningless when that same government delays a stimulus package and promotes protests against stay-at-home orders and mask mandates.

2020-12-28 10:33:03+00:00,33,"One health story dominated headlines for virtually all of 2020: the coronavirus pandemic.

But while Covid-19 did slow down medical research in other areas, the science didn't stop. Researchers rolled out new ways to cope with common diseases, and even a treatment for another feared virus.

Here are the accomplishments that may have flown under the public's radar in 2020.

A treatment for Ebola

Six years ago, the world had its eyes on a different virus: Ebola, in West Africa. In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved Inmazeb, the first treatment for the deadly disease.

Inmazeb is a monoclonal antibody cocktail made by the drugmaker Regeneron. A study that began in 2018 during an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo showed that the drug improved survival rates; researchers found that nearly 34 percent of patients who received Inmazeb died, compared with 51 percent of patients who received a control.

Monoclonal antibodies are made in the lab to mimic the body's natural immune response. This year, Regeneron also developed a monoclonal antibody cocktail for Covid-19, which President Donald Trump received when he was hospitalized with the illness.

In December, the FDA approved a second treatment for Ebola, another monoclonal antibody drug called Ebanga, made by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.

Weekly insulin shot

People with Type 2 diabetes may find reprieve from daily shots with an experimental form of insulin. In September, researchers at the Dallas Diabetes Research Center found that a once-weekly insulin shot was able to lower blood sugar just as well as a daily insulin shot in those with Type 2 diabetes.

The research, while relatively small with just 247 participants, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The hope is that patients with Type 2 diabetes will be more likely to adhere to a once-a-week injection than a daily shot.

One pill to cut the risk of heart problems

A single pill that combines four medications meant to lower blood pressure and cholesterol plus an aspirin was found in November to cut the risk of heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer.

A large study of 5,713 participants published in November found that the so-called polypill cut the risk for heart attack and stroke in at-risk patients by nearly a third.

The polypill used in the study was a combination of a statin called simvastatin, a beta blocker called atenolol, a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide and an ACE inhibitor called ramipril. All are sold as generics, which means this could be a low-cost method of treating patients at risk for heart events.

What's more, patients may be more likely to comply with their doctor's orders if they need to fill and take only one pill, instead of four.

A blood test to look for Alzheimer's disease

Also in November, the first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease became available in the U.S.

The test, from C2N Diagnostics of St. Louis, Missouri, measures two types of amyloid proteins — generally considered a hallmark of Alzheimer's — and looks for evidence that a person has a genetic risk factor for the disease. It is meant for people 60 and older who are having memory issues and who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's. It is expensive ($1,250) and not covered by health insurance. Results are generally expected within 10 days.

Data on the test's accuracy have not been made public, and it is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Outside experts remained cautious, but said that even if the blood test were to show a low likelihood of true Alzheimer's disease, it could give doctors a clue that something else might be causing memory problems, such as side effects of medications or even vitamin deficiencies.

Toward a cure for sickle cell disease

Early December brought early but promising results from the first studies on gene editing for excruciatingly painful and inherited blood disorders most likely to occur among those of African descent.

The technology, called CRISPR, involves permanently altering DNA in a person's blood cells. The approach could possibly cure sickle cell disease, in which crescent-shaped red blood cells clump together to the point that they're unable to flow easily throughout the body, starving organs and tissue of the oxygen they need.

Using CRISPR, doctors are essentially able to switch off a faulty gene that creates the problem. In studies, 10 patients were able to remain without pain episodes for at least several months, and were able to be free of regular blood transfusions previously necessary to treat their disorders.

The only other potential cure for sickle cell disease involves a complicated bone marrow transplant from a closely matched donor who does not have the disease.

Pediatric heart hope

One of the last advances of 2020 was the Food and Drug Administration's approval of a heart pump to be used in children in need of a heart transplant.

Abbott's HeartMate 3 heart pump is meant for children with a specific condition called advanced refractory left ventricular heart failure that requires a full heart transplant. Without intervention, the condition is deadly, as the heart is too weak to pump on its own.

Two years after the implant — which is permanent — Abbott said patients who received the pump had a 79 percent survival rate, comparable to those who received a heart transplant.

But patients who receive heart transplants must be put on medications to suppress their body's natural immune response to attack the new heart for the rest of their lives. A device like Abbott's does not require such medication.

2020-12-28 08:01:05+00:00,24,"One tray of Covid-19 vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer contains 975 doses — way too many for a rural hospital in Arkansas.

But with the logistical gymnastics required to safely get the Pfizer vaccine to rural health care workers, splitting the trays into smaller shipments has its own dangers. Once out of the freezer that keeps it at 94 degrees below zero, the vaccine lasts only five days and must be refrigerated in transit.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In Arkansas — where over 40 percent of its counties are rural and Covid-19 infections are climbing — solving this distribution puzzle is urgently critical, said Dr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state’s epidemiologist.

“If their providers come down with Covid-19,” Dillaha said, “there’s no one there to take care of the patients.”

Such quandaries resonate with officials in Georgia, Kentucky, Utah, Indiana, Wisconsin and Colorado. The first push of the nation’s mass Covid-19 vaccination effort has been chaotic, marked by a lack of guidance and miscommunication from the federal level.

With Washington punting most vaccination decisions, each state and county is left to weigh where to send vaccines first and which of two vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use makes the most sense for each nursing home, hospital, local health department and even school. And after state officials warned for months they lacked the resources to distribute vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is only now set to receive a major bump in funding — $8.75 billion in Congress’ latest relief bill, which lawmakers are likely to pass this week.

The feat facing public health officials has “absolutely no comparison” in recent history, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.

Officials who thought the H1N1 swine flu shot in 2009 was a logistical nightmare say it now looks simple in comparison. “It was a flu vaccine. It was one dose. It came at refrigerator-stable temperatures,” Hannan said. “It was nothing like this.”

Within just a few days, the logistical barriers of the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech were laid bare. Many officials now hang their hopes on Moderna, whose vaccine comes in containers of 100 doses, doesn’t require deep freezing and is good for 30 days from the time it’s shipped.

The federal government had divvied up nearly 8 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines to distribute this week, on top of roughly 3 million Pfizer shots that were sent last week, said Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed effort.

Perna said he took “personal responsibility” for overstating how many Pfizer doses states would receive.

Federal delays have led to confusion, Dillaha said: “Sometimes we don’t have information from CDC or Operation Warp Speed until right before a decision needs to be made.”

Officials in other states painted a mixed picture of the rollout.

Georgia’s Coastal Health District, which oversees public health for eight counties and has offices in Savannah and Brunswick, spent more than $27,000 on two ultra-cold freezers for the Pfizer vaccine, which it’s treating “like gold,” said Dr. Lawton Davis, its health director. Health care workers are being asked to travel, some up to 40 minutes, to get their vaccinations, because shipping them would risk wasting doses, he said. Vaccination uptake has been lower than Davis would like to see. “It’s sort of a jigsaw puzzle and balancing act,” he said. “We’re kind of learning as we go.”

In Utah, sites to vaccinate teachers and first responders starting in January had no capability to store the Pfizer vaccine, although officials are trying to secure some ultra-cold storage, a state department of health spokesperson said. Very few of Kentucky’s local health offices could store the Pfizer shots, because of refrigeration requirements and the size of shipments, said Sara Jo Best, public health director of the Lincoln Trail District. Indiana’s state health department had to identify alternative cold storage options for 17 hospitals following changes in guidance for the vaccine thermal shippers.

And in New Hampshire, where the National Guard will help administer vaccines, officials last week were still finalizing details for 13 community-based sites where first responders and health care workers are due to get vaccinated later this month. Jake Leon, a state Health and Human Services spokesperson, said that while the sites will be able to administer both companies’ vaccines, most likely they’ll get Moderna’s because of its easier transport. Even as the earliest vaccines are injected, much remains up in the air.

“It’s day to day and even then hour by hour or minute by minute — what we know and how we plan for it,” Leon said Friday. “We’re building the plane while flying it.”

In all, the Trump administration has bought 900 million Covid-19 vaccine doses from six companies, but most of the vaccines are still in clinical studies. Even the front-runners whose shots have received FDA emergency authorization — Pfizer and BioNTech on Dec. 11, Moderna on Dec. 18 — will require months to manufacture at that scale. The Trump administration plans to distribute 20 million vaccine doses to states by early January, Perna said Saturday.

By spring, officials hope to stage broader vaccine deployment beyond top-priority populations of health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, as well as first responders.

During the effort to vaccinate Americans against H1N1, Dillaha said, health departments set up mass vaccination clinics in their counties and delivered doses to schools. But hospitals are taking charge of parts of the initial Covid-19 immunization campaign, both because health care workers are at highest risk of illness or death from Covid-19, and to pick up the slack from health departments overwhelmed by case investigations and contact tracing from an unending stream of new infections.

Best said her workforce is struggling to keep up with Covid-19 infections alone, much less flu season and upcoming Covid-19 vaccinations. Public health department personnel in Kentucky shrank by 49 percent from 2009 to 2019, according to state data she supplied. Across the country, 38,000 state and local health positions have disappeared since the 2008 recession. Per capita spending for local health departments has dropped by 18 percent since 2010.

Nationally, Pfizer and Moderna have signed contracts with the federal government to each provide 100 million vaccine doses by the end of March; Moderna is set to deliver a second tranche of 100 million doses by June. States were playing it safe last week, directing Pfizer vials mainly to facilities with ultra-cold freezers, Hannan said.

“A lot of that vaccine is destined for institutional facilities,” Sean Dickson, director of health policy for West Health Policy Center, said of the Pfizer shots. The center, with the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, found that 35 percent of counties have two or fewer facilities to administer Covid-19 vaccines.

The analysis found tremendous variation in how far people would need to drive for the vaccine. Residents of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas face the longest drives, with more than 10 percent living more than 10 miles from the closest facility that could administer a shot.

Counties with long driving distances between sites and a low number of sites overall “are going to be the hardest ones to reach,” said Inmaculada Hernandez, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and lead author of the analysis.

Certain vaccines could be better suited for such places, including Johnson & Johnson’s potential offering, which is a single shot, and health departments could distribute in rural areas through mobile units, she said. The company is expected to apply for FDA emergency authorization in February, Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Moncef Slaoui said this month.

Until then, Pfizer and Moderna are the companies supplying doses for the country, and they’re not considered equal even though each is more than 90 percent effective at reducing disease.

In Wisconsin, the Moderna vaccine “gives us many more options” and “allows for us to get doses to those smaller clinics, more-rural clinics, in a way that reduces the number of logistics” needed for ultra-cold storage, Dr. Stephanie Schauer, the state’s immunization program manager, told reporters Wednesday.

Alan Morgan, head of the National Rural Health Association, echoed that the Moderna vaccine is being looked to as a “rural solution.” But he said states including Kansas have shown that a Pfizer rural rollout can be done.

“It’s where these states put a priority — either they prioritize rural or they don’t,” he said. “It’s a cautionary tale of what we may see this spring, of rural populations perhaps being second-tier when it comes to vaccination.”

Virginia, too, has a plan for getting the Pfizer vaccine to far-flung places. It’s shipping the vaccines to 18 health facilities with ultra-cold freezers across the state. The hubs are distributed widely enough so vaccinators can bring shots from there to health workers even in thinly populated areas before they spoil, said Brookie Crawford, spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health’s central region.

Washington, on the other hand, allows hospitals without ultra-cold freezers to temporarily store Pfizer vaccines in the thermal boxes they arrive in, said Franji Mayes, spokesperson for the state’s health department. That means a box needs to be used quickly, before doses expire.

“We are also working on a policy that will allow hospitals who don’t expect to vaccinate 975 people to transfer extra vaccine to other enrolled facilities,” she said. “This will reduce wasted vaccine.”

2020-12-28 05:32:02+00:00,285,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus advisory team consulted scientists and supply chain experts about whether he should invoke a wartime production law to help produce and administer more Covid-19 vaccines, two advisers familiar with the discussions said.

President Donald Trump has already invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, to speed the production of medical supplies and components to test for the coronavirus, and he has raised the possibility of using the law again for vaccines. Manufacturers have said there could be a shortage of components to make the vaccines.

The DPA was enacted during the Korean War to allow the federal government to compel manufacturing production for national defense. Biden's team has explored using it soon after he takes office next month to try to meet the goal of mass vaccination by summer, the advisers said.

Biden's aides have already begun to warn that the Trump administration's timeline projecting mass vaccination in the spring may be too optimistic, carrying the risk that Biden will be blamed when expectations aren't met. Whether to invoke the DPA to speed production could be an early test for Biden.

Scientists are advising the Biden team about how the DPA could ""enhance parts of the manufacturing process,"" one of the advisers said, declining to be more specific.

As part of negotiations to sell 100 million more vaccine doses to Americans, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has pressed the Trump administration to activate the DPA. Pfizer, working with its partner BioNTech, and Moderna are the only companies that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S.

A Pfizer spokesperson said the company continues to work with the government and is confident that it can ""remove any obstacle that may present itself as we work to ramp up manufacturing to deliver any additional doses.""

Teresa Davis, a senior White House communications adviser, said the Trump administration has already invoked the DPA for some aspects of vaccine production and is actively discussing the issue with Pfizer.

""We are working closely with Pfizer and other manufacturers to ensure that all obstacles to production are removed so that the American people receive vaccines as rapidly as possible,"" David said. ""In addition, 23 manufacturing sites were set up just for Operation Warp Speed to help scale industrial production of the vaccine.""

But Biden officials say a range of serious issues must be considered before they can use the law. A primary concern, an official said, would be how to invoke the law in an equitable way that doesn't favor one company over another.

Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, two other pharmaceutical companies, are in the final phases of testing vaccines, and they expect to be completed and apply for emergency use authorization in February.

Dr. Brett Giroir, who has been leading vaccine testing efforts for the Trump administration, said the majority of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer. But Biden officials say many obstacles stand in the way, primarily a lack of vaccine supply.

Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said vaccinating 70 percent of the population by the spring, which experts say is the level required to end transmission of the virus, is unlikely without a considerable boost in supply.

""Right now, we don't have that,"" Spiro said. ""This is about scaling production so that we can achieve herd immunity as rapidly as possible.""

There are also concerns about looming syringe and needle shortages, Spiro said.

In July, Spiro co-wrote a comprehensive vaccine proposal with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a member of Biden's Covid-19 transition advisory board. Their blueprint calls for using the DPA to ""coordinate vaccine manufacturing capacity and supply chains"" for glass vials, syringes, needles and other supplies.

Spiro said the law would also help companies with existing manufacturing facilities prepare to handle mass production of vaccines. He cited the pharmaceutical giant Merck as a company with vast production capacity that could be used to produce another company's vaccine.

The DPA could also be used to mass-produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is expected to require one dose rather than the two-shot regimen required by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Spiro said.

Spiro said there are other ways to bolster vaccine and vaccine component supply without invoking the DPA, pointing to a facility at Texas A&M University already under contract to the government to mass-produce vaccines.",MSNBC,"['law', 'biden', 'production', 'aides', 'spiro', 'weighing', 'vaccines', 'manufacturing', 'pfizer', 'boosting', 'act', 'dpa', 'vaccine', 'trump', 'defense']",0

His last-minute decision, coming after he caused days of legislative chaos by lacerating a bill his own aides had negotiated, will restore enhanced unemployment assistance that expired Sunday and avert a shutdown that would have begun Tuesday.

🚨🚨🚨President @realDonaldTrump has signed H.R. 133, an Act making consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, providing coronavirus emergency response and relief, and for other purposes. — Judd Deere (@JuddPDeere45) December 28, 2020

The bill, the result of protracted negotiations between party leaders and the Trump administration — which Trump largely sat out — includes a $900 billion Covid-19 stimulus package to extend the unemployment benefits: $114 to $357 weekly payments to unemployed gig workers and self-employed people whose businesses have stalled. The funds have been a lifeline for 7.3 million Americans out of work because of the coronavirus.

The package also extends the federal moratorium on evictions, which was set to expire Thursday. Without the extension, millions of people faced immediate housing crises.

The legislation also funds the federal government through September. Congress passed the bill with strong bipartisan support late Monday, but Trump upended the consensus by suddenly raising an objection to the size of a new round of direct payments, which came as news to his aides who had negotiated them with Congress.

He demanded that lawmakers raise the amount to $2,000 and criticized other elements, which he called ""pork,"" in the mammoth spending package, including routine annual foreign aid payments. Trump reiterated his criticism Saturday, tweeting, ""I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill.""

The Covid-19 aid package includes additional assistance for small businesses and $600 in direct payments to Americans who earned less than $75,000 in the previous tax year.

The amount represented a compromise between Democrats, who wanted larger checks, and Republicans, many of whom opposed additional direct payments.

In a statement Sunday announcing that he had signed the relief bill while claiming that both chambers of Congress would begin the process of meeting some of his demands, Trump said he had ""told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child.""

He continued: ""As President I am demanding many rescissions under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.""

""I will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed. I will send back to Congress a redlined version, item by item, accompanied by the formal rescission request to Congress insisting that those funds be removed from the bill,"" Trump said.

The act allows for a president to request that Congress rescind appropriated funds, but Congress can ignore such requests, and such cuts are highly unlikely. The 116th Congress ends Jan. 3, and President-elect Joe Biden will not go along with Trump's demands.

Trump's statement also claimed without evidence that ""the House and Senate have agreed to focus strongly on the very substantial voter fraud which took place in the November 3 Presidential election.""

The House is controlled by Democrats, who would never agree to such a demand. Trump's claim of ""very substantial voter fraud"" is baseless. His campaign has failed to provide any evidence of fraud in the dozens of lawsuits it has filed to overturn the results. Former Attorney General William Barr confirmed this month that the Justice Department had uncovered no widespread fraud in the election, and states have certified the results confirming Biden the winner.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who proposed the $600 checks and negotiated the stimulus package with congressional leadership, said days ago in an interview with CNBC that Americans could see the checks quickly.

Trump said in his statement Sunday evening that the House would vote Monday to increase the amount to $2,000 for individuals and that the Senate would likewise ""start the process.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that Trump's signature was ""welcome news,"" and she called on Trump to encourage Republicans to ""end their obstruction"" and support House Democrats' standalone effort to boost direct payments.

In his own statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made no mention of any of the promises Trump ascribed to the chamber, including any possible vote on increasing the payment amount.

Instead, McConnell thanked Trump and praised him for his ""leadership"" in preventing the government shutdown that would have been triggered by his continued refusal to sign the bill.

""His leadership has prevented a government shutdown at a time when our nation could not have afforded one,"" McConnell said.

Trump has been spending the holiday at Mar-a-Lago, his private resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and he visited Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday morning, according to the traveling media pool report.

He hinted at his reversal in a tweet Sunday evening before returning to his golf club.

If the president had chosen to veto the legislation, it would have set up his second showdown with Republicans in Congress who have been reluctant to cross him.

2020-12-27 21:31:05+00:00,48,"One health story dominated headlines for virtually all of 2020: the coronavirus pandemic.

But while Covid-19 did slow down medical research in other areas, the science didn't stop. Researchers rolled out new ways to cope with common diseases, and even a treatment for another feared virus.

Here are the accomplishments that may have flown under the public's radar in 2020.

A treatment for Ebola

Six years ago, the world had its eyes on a different virus: Ebola, in West Africa. In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved Inmazeb, the first treatment for the deadly disease.

Inmazeb is a monoclonal antibody cocktail made by the drugmaker Regeneron. A study that began in 2018 during an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo showed that the drug improved survival rates; researchers found that nearly 34 percent of patients who received Inmazeb died, compared with 51 percent of patients who received a control.

Monoclonal antibodies are made in the lab to mimic the body's natural immune response. This year, Regeneron also developed a monoclonal antibody cocktail for Covid-19, which President Donald Trump received when he was hospitalized with the illness.

In December, the FDA approved a second treatment for Ebola, another monoclonal antibody drug called Ebanga, made by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.

Weekly insulin shot

People with Type 2 diabetes may find reprieve from daily shots with an experimental form of insulin. In September, researchers at the Dallas Diabetes Research Center found that a once-weekly insulin shot was able to lower blood sugar just as well as a daily insulin shot in those with Type 2 diabetes.

The research, while relatively small with just 247 participants, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The hope is that patients with Type 2 diabetes will be more likely to adhere to a once-a-week injection than a daily shot.

One pill to cut the risk of heart problems

A single pill that combines four medications meant to lower blood pressure and cholesterol plus an aspirin was found in November to cut the risk of heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer.

A large study of 5,713 participants published in November found that the so-called polypill cut the risk for heart attack and stroke in at-risk patients by nearly a third.

The polypill used in the study was a combination of a statin called simvastatin, a beta blocker called atenolol, a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide and an ACE inhibitor called ramipril. All are sold as generics, which means this could be a low-cost method of treating patients at risk for heart events.

What's more, patients may be more likely to comply with their doctor's orders if they need to fill and take only one pill, instead of four.

A blood test to look for Alzheimer's disease

Also in November, the first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease became available in the U.S.

The test, from C2N Diagnostics of St. Louis, Missouri, measures two types of amyloid proteins — generally considered a hallmark of Alzheimer's — and looks for evidence that a person has a genetic risk factor for the disease. It is meant for people 60 and older who are having memory issues and who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's. It is expensive ($1,250) and not covered by health insurance. Results are generally expected within 10 days.

Data on the test's accuracy have not been made public, and it is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Outside experts remained cautious, but said that even if the blood test were to show a low likelihood of true Alzheimer's disease, it could give doctors a clue that something else might be causing memory problems, such as side effects of medications or even vitamin deficiencies.

Toward a cure for sickle cell disease

Early December brought early but promising results from the first studies on gene editing for excruciatingly painful and inherited blood disorders most likely to occur among those of African descent.

The technology, called CRISPR, involves permanently altering DNA in a person's blood cells. The approach could possibly cure sickle cell disease, in which crescent-shaped red blood cells clump together to the point that they're unable to flow easily throughout the body, starving organs and tissue of the oxygen they need.

Using CRISPR, doctors are essentially able to switch off a faulty gene that creates the problem. In studies, 10 patients were able to remain without pain episodes for at least several months, and were able to be free of regular blood transfusions previously necessary to treat their disorders.

The only other potential cure for sickle cell disease involves a complicated bone marrow transplant from a closely matched donor who does not have the disease.

Pediatric heart hope

One of the last advances of 2020 was the Food and Drug Administration's approval of a heart pump to be used in children in need of a heart transplant.

Abbott's HeartMate 3 heart pump is meant for children with a specific condition called advanced refractory left ventricular heart failure that requires a full heart transplant. Without intervention, the condition is deadly, as the heart is too weak to pump on its own.

Two years after the implant — which is permanent — Abbott said patients who received the pump had a 79 percent survival rate, comparable to those who received a heart transplant.

But patients who receive heart transplants must be put on medications to suppress their body's natural immune response to attack the new heart for the rest of their lives. A device like Abbott's does not require such medication.

2020-12-27 18:01:03+00:00,27,"Mass vaccination programs began to roll out across Europe on Sunday after several countries reported cases of a more contagious variant of the coronavirus.

On what some have dubbed ""V-Day,"" Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain began inoculations, starting out with health care workers and those most at risk of contracting the disease.

The coordinated vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale in the European Union, home to almost 450 million people, is a crucial step in curbing the pandemic.

In Italy, the first doses of the vaccine developed by the American drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, were administered to five health care workers at Rome's Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases, which has been on the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 since the beginning.

""Today is finally a good day,"" the country's virus czar, Domenico Arcuri, said at a news conference. ""We see the light at the end of the tunnel.""

But he warned that people should ""continue to be prudent, cautious and responsible,"" as Italy, which has recorded Europe's highest number of deaths, 72,000, still has a long road ahead.

A total of 9,750 doses of the vaccine, which cleared regulatory hurdles in Europe last week, have arrived in the country to be distributed across its 20 regions, the Health Ministry said.

Altogether, the E.U.'s 27 countries have recorded nearly 15 million coronavirus infections and more than 353,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 1.7 million people have died worldwide.

Each E.U. country will make its own decision about who gets the first shots, with most vowing to put the elderly and residents in nursing homes first.

France also started to administer the vaccine Sunday. The Social Affairs ad Health Ministry said it had ordered almost 68 million doses of the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from the E.U., which are to be delivered by July.

A day before the vaccination campaign officially started in Germany, a small number of people at a care home for the elderly were inoculated in the town of Halberstadt on Saturday.

Edith Kwoizalla, age 101, got the first dose.

The government plans to distribute more than 1.3 million vaccine doses to local health authorities by the end of the month, German Health Minister Jens Spahn tweeted last week.

Hungary and Slovakia began vaccinating people Saturday, a day ahead of the general European rollout, while Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis became the first person in the country to be given the vaccine Sunday.

The first cases of a new virus variant, which British authorities said could be 70 percent more transmissible after it was discovered in the U.K., were detected in France, Ireland and Sweden over the weekend.

Fears over the new strain led China's aviation regulator to suspend flights to and from the U.K. on Sunday until at least Jan. 10. More than 40 countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Japan, have also restricted travel from Britain.

2020-12-27 11:03:02+00:00,252,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus advisory team consulted scientists and supply chain experts about whether he should invoke a wartime production law to help produce and administer more Covid-19 vaccines, two advisers familiar with the discussions said.

President Donald Trump has already invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, to speed the production of medical supplies and components to test for the coronavirus, and he has raised the possibility of using the law again for vaccines. Manufacturers have said there could be a shortage of components to make the vaccines.

The DPA was enacted during the Korean War to allow the federal government to compel manufacturing production for national defense. Biden's team has explored using it soon after he takes office next month to try to meet the goal of mass vaccination by summer, the advisers said.

Biden's aides have already begun to warn that the Trump administration's timeline projecting mass vaccination in the spring may be too optimistic, carrying the risk that Biden will be blamed when expectations aren't met. Whether to invoke the DPA to speed production could be an early test for Biden.

Scientists are advising the Biden team about how the DPA could ""enhance parts of the manufacturing process,"" one of the advisers said, declining to be more specific.

As part of negotiations to sell 100 million more vaccine doses to Americans, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has pressed the Trump administration to activate the DPA. Pfizer, working with its partner BioNTech, and Moderna are the only companies that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S.

A Pfizer spokesperson said the company continues to work with the government and is confident that it can ""remove any obstacle that may present itself as we work to ramp up manufacturing to deliver any additional doses.""

Teresa Davis, a senior White House communications adviser, said the Trump administration has already invoked the DPA for some aspects of vaccine production and is actively discussing the issue with Pfizer.

""We are working closely with Pfizer and other manufacturers to ensure that all obstacles to production are removed so that the American people receive vaccines as rapidly as possible,"" David said. ""In addition, 23 manufacturing sites were set up just for Operation Warp Speed to help scale industrial production of the vaccine.""

But Biden officials say a range of serious issues must be considered before they can use the law. A primary concern, an official said, would be how to invoke the law in an equitable way that doesn't favor one company over another.

Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, two other pharmaceutical companies, are in the final phases of testing vaccines, and they expect to be completed and apply for emergency use authorization in February.

Dr. Brett Giroir, who has been leading vaccine testing efforts for the Trump administration, said the majority of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer. But Biden officials say many obstacles stand in the way, primarily a lack of vaccine supply.

Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said vaccinating 70 percent of the population by the spring, which experts say is the level required to end transmission of the virus, is unlikely without a considerable boost in supply.

""Right now, we don't have that,"" Spiro said. ""This is about scaling production so that we can achieve herd immunity as rapidly as possible.""

There are also concerns about looming syringe and needle shortages, Spiro said.

In July, Spiro co-wrote a comprehensive vaccine proposal with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a member of Biden's Covid-19 transition advisory board. Their blueprint calls for using the DPA to ""coordinate vaccine manufacturing capacity and supply chains"" for glass vials, syringes, needles and other supplies.

Spiro said the law would also help companies with existing manufacturing facilities prepare to handle mass production of vaccines. He cited the pharmaceutical giant Merck as a company with vast production capacity that could be used to produce another company's vaccine.

The DPA could also be used to mass-produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is expected to require one dose rather than the two-shot regimen required by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Spiro said.

Spiro said there are other ways to bolster vaccine and vaccine component supply without invoking the DPA, pointing to a facility at Texas A&M University already under contract to the government to mass-produce vaccines.",MSNBC,"['law', 'biden', 'production', 'aides', 'spiro', 'weighing', 'vaccines', 'manufacturing', 'pfizer', 'boosting', 'act', 'dpa', 'vaccine', 'trump', 'defense']",0

2020-12-25 02:31:05+00:00,24,"One tray of Covid-19 vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer contains 975 doses — way too many for a rural hospital in Arkansas.

But with the logistical gymnastics required to safely get the Pfizer vaccine to rural health care workers, splitting the trays into smaller shipments has its own dangers. Once out of the freezer that keeps it at 94 degrees below zero, the vaccine lasts only five days and must be refrigerated in transit.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In Arkansas — where over 40 percent of its counties are rural and Covid-19 infections are climbing — solving this distribution puzzle is urgently critical, said Dr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state’s epidemiologist.

“If their providers come down with Covid-19,” Dillaha said, “there’s no one there to take care of the patients.”

Such quandaries resonate with officials in Georgia, Kentucky, Utah, Indiana, Wisconsin and Colorado. The first push of the nation’s mass Covid-19 vaccination effort has been chaotic, marked by a lack of guidance and miscommunication from the federal level.

With Washington punting most vaccination decisions, each state and county is left to weigh where to send vaccines first and which of two vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use makes the most sense for each nursing home, hospital, local health department and even school. And after state officials warned for months they lacked the resources to distribute vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is only now set to receive a major bump in funding — $8.75 billion in Congress’ latest relief bill, which lawmakers are likely to pass this week.

The feat facing public health officials has “absolutely no comparison” in recent history, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.

Officials who thought the H1N1 swine flu shot in 2009 was a logistical nightmare say it now looks simple in comparison. “It was a flu vaccine. It was one dose. It came at refrigerator-stable temperatures,” Hannan said. “It was nothing like this.”

Within just a few days, the logistical barriers of the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech were laid bare. Many officials now hang their hopes on Moderna, whose vaccine comes in containers of 100 doses, doesn’t require deep freezing and is good for 30 days from the time it’s shipped.

The federal government had divvied up nearly 8 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines to distribute this week, on top of roughly 3 million Pfizer shots that were sent last week, said Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed effort.

Perna said he took “personal responsibility” for overstating how many Pfizer doses states would receive.

Federal delays have led to confusion, Dillaha said: “Sometimes we don’t have information from CDC or Operation Warp Speed until right before a decision needs to be made.”

Officials in other states painted a mixed picture of the rollout.

Georgia’s Coastal Health District, which oversees public health for eight counties and has offices in Savannah and Brunswick, spent more than $27,000 on two ultra-cold freezers for the Pfizer vaccine, which it’s treating “like gold,” said Dr. Lawton Davis, its health director. Health care workers are being asked to travel, some up to 40 minutes, to get their vaccinations, because shipping them would risk wasting doses, he said. Vaccination uptake has been lower than Davis would like to see. “It’s sort of a jigsaw puzzle and balancing act,” he said. “We’re kind of learning as we go.”

In Utah, sites to vaccinate teachers and first responders starting in January had no capability to store the Pfizer vaccine, although officials are trying to secure some ultra-cold storage, a state department of health spokesperson said. Very few of Kentucky’s local health offices could store the Pfizer shots, because of refrigeration requirements and the size of shipments, said Sara Jo Best, public health director of the Lincoln Trail District. Indiana’s state health department had to identify alternative cold storage options for 17 hospitals following changes in guidance for the vaccine thermal shippers.

And in New Hampshire, where the National Guard will help administer vaccines, officials last week were still finalizing details for 13 community-based sites where first responders and health care workers are due to get vaccinated later this month. Jake Leon, a state Health and Human Services spokesperson, said that while the sites will be able to administer both companies’ vaccines, most likely they’ll get Moderna’s because of its easier transport. Even as the earliest vaccines are injected, much remains up in the air.

“It’s day to day and even then hour by hour or minute by minute — what we know and how we plan for it,” Leon said Friday. “We’re building the plane while flying it.”

In all, the Trump administration has bought 900 million Covid-19 vaccine doses from six companies, but most of the vaccines are still in clinical studies. Even the front-runners whose shots have received FDA emergency authorization — Pfizer and BioNTech on Dec. 11, Moderna on Dec. 18 — will require months to manufacture at that scale. The Trump administration plans to distribute 20 million vaccine doses to states by early January, Perna said Saturday.

By spring, officials hope to stage broader vaccine deployment beyond top-priority populations of health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, as well as first responders.

During the effort to vaccinate Americans against H1N1, Dillaha said, health departments set up mass vaccination clinics in their counties and delivered doses to schools. But hospitals are taking charge of parts of the initial Covid-19 immunization campaign, both because health care workers are at highest risk of illness or death from Covid-19, and to pick up the slack from health departments overwhelmed by case investigations and contact tracing from an unending stream of new infections.

Best said her workforce is struggling to keep up with Covid-19 infections alone, much less flu season and upcoming Covid-19 vaccinations. Public health department personnel in Kentucky shrank by 49 percent from 2009 to 2019, according to state data she supplied. Across the country, 38,000 state and local health positions have disappeared since the 2008 recession. Per capita spending for local health departments has dropped by 18 percent since 2010.

Nationally, Pfizer and Moderna have signed contracts with the federal government to each provide 100 million vaccine doses by the end of March; Moderna is set to deliver a second tranche of 100 million doses by June. States were playing it safe last week, directing Pfizer vials mainly to facilities with ultra-cold freezers, Hannan said.

“A lot of that vaccine is destined for institutional facilities,” Sean Dickson, director of health policy for West Health Policy Center, said of the Pfizer shots. The center, with the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, found that 35 percent of counties have two or fewer facilities to administer Covid-19 vaccines.

The analysis found tremendous variation in how far people would need to drive for the vaccine. Residents of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas face the longest drives, with more than 10 percent living more than 10 miles from the closest facility that could administer a shot.

Counties with long driving distances between sites and a low number of sites overall “are going to be the hardest ones to reach,” said Inmaculada Hernandez, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and lead author of the analysis.

Certain vaccines could be better suited for such places, including Johnson & Johnson’s potential offering, which is a single shot, and health departments could distribute in rural areas through mobile units, she said. The company is expected to apply for FDA emergency authorization in February, Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Moncef Slaoui said this month.

Until then, Pfizer and Moderna are the companies supplying doses for the country, and they’re not considered equal even though each is more than 90 percent effective at reducing disease.

In Wisconsin, the Moderna vaccine “gives us many more options” and “allows for us to get doses to those smaller clinics, more-rural clinics, in a way that reduces the number of logistics” needed for ultra-cold storage, Dr. Stephanie Schauer, the state’s immunization program manager, told reporters Wednesday.

Alan Morgan, head of the National Rural Health Association, echoed that the Moderna vaccine is being looked to as a “rural solution.” But he said states including Kansas have shown that a Pfizer rural rollout can be done.

“It’s where these states put a priority — either they prioritize rural or they don’t,” he said. “It’s a cautionary tale of what we may see this spring, of rural populations perhaps being second-tier when it comes to vaccination.”

Virginia, too, has a plan for getting the Pfizer vaccine to far-flung places. It’s shipping the vaccines to 18 health facilities with ultra-cold freezers across the state. The hubs are distributed widely enough so vaccinators can bring shots from there to health workers even in thinly populated areas before they spoil, said Brookie Crawford, spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health’s central region.

Washington, on the other hand, allows hospitals without ultra-cold freezers to temporarily store Pfizer vaccines in the thermal boxes they arrive in, said Franji Mayes, spokesperson for the state’s health department. That means a box needs to be used quickly, before doses expire.

“We are also working on a policy that will allow hospitals who don’t expect to vaccinate 975 people to transfer extra vaccine to other enrolled facilities,” she said. “This will reduce wasted vaccine.”

2020-12-24 21:31:07+00:00,127,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus advisory team consulted scientists and supply chain experts about whether he should invoke a wartime production law to help produce and administer more Covid-19 vaccines, two advisers familiar with the discussions said.

President Donald Trump has already invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, to speed the production of medical supplies and components to test for the coronavirus, and he has raised the possibility of using the law again for vaccines. Manufacturers have said there could be a shortage of components to make the vaccines.

The DPA was enacted during the Korean War to allow the federal government to compel manufacturing production for national defense. Biden's team has explored using it soon after he takes office next month to try to meet the goal of mass vaccination by summer, the advisers said.

Biden's aides have already begun to warn that the Trump administration's timeline projecting mass vaccination in the spring may be too optimistic, carrying the risk that Biden will be blamed when expectations aren't met. Whether to invoke the DPA to speed production could be an early test for Biden.

Scientists are advising the Biden team about how the DPA could ""enhance parts of the manufacturing process,"" one of the advisers said, declining to be more specific.

As part of negotiations to sell 100 million more vaccine doses to Americans, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has pressed the Trump administration to activate the DPA. Pfizer, working with its partner BioNTech, and Moderna are the only companies that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S.

A Pfizer spokesperson said the company continues to work with the government and is confident that it can ""remove any obstacle that may present itself as we work to ramp up manufacturing to deliver any additional doses.""

Teresa Davis, a senior White House communications adviser, said the Trump administration has already invoked the DPA for some aspects of vaccine production and is actively discussing the issue with Pfizer.

""We are working closely with Pfizer and other manufacturers to ensure that all obstacles to production are removed so that the American people receive vaccines as rapidly as possible,"" David said. ""In addition, 23 manufacturing sites were set up just for Operation Warp Speed to help scale industrial production of the vaccine.""

But Biden officials say a range of serious issues must be considered before they can use the law. A primary concern, an official said, would be how to invoke the law in an equitable way that doesn't favor one company over another.

Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, two other pharmaceutical companies, are in the final phases of testing vaccines, and they expect to be completed and apply for emergency use authorization in February.

Dr. Brett Giroir, who has been leading vaccine testing efforts for the Trump administration, said the majority of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer. But Biden officials say many obstacles stand in the way, primarily a lack of vaccine supply.

Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said vaccinating 70 percent of the population by the spring, which experts say is the level required to end transmission of the virus, is unlikely without a considerable boost in supply.

""Right now, we don't have that,"" Spiro said. ""This is about scaling production so that we can achieve herd immunity as rapidly as possible.""

There are also concerns about looming syringe and needle shortages, Spiro said.

In July, Spiro co-wrote a comprehensive vaccine proposal with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a member of Biden's Covid-19 transition advisory board. Their blueprint calls for using the DPA to ""coordinate vaccine manufacturing capacity and supply chains"" for glass vials, syringes, needles and other supplies.

Spiro said the law would also help companies with existing manufacturing facilities prepare to handle mass production of vaccines. He cited the pharmaceutical giant Merck as a company with vast production capacity that could be used to produce another company's vaccine.

The DPA could also be used to mass-produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is expected to require one dose rather than the two-shot regimen required by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Spiro said.

Spiro said there are other ways to bolster vaccine and vaccine component supply without invoking the DPA, pointing to a facility at Texas A&M University already under contract to the government to mass-produce vaccines.",MSNBC,"['law', 'biden', 'production', 'aides', 'spiro', 'weighing', 'vaccines', 'manufacturing', 'pfizer', 'boosting', 'act', 'dpa', 'vaccine', 'trump', 'defense']",0

""In addition, 23 manufacturing sites were set up just for Operation Warp Speed to help scale industrial production of the vaccine.""

But Biden officials say a range of serious issues must be considered before they can use the law. A primary concern, an official said, would be how to invoke the law in an equitable way that doesn't favor one company over another.

Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, two other pharmaceutical companies, are in the final phases of testing vaccines, and they expect to be completed and apply for emergency use authorization in February.

Dr. Brett Giroir, who has been leading vaccine testing efforts for the Trump administration, said the majority of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer. But Biden officials say many obstacles stand in the way, primarily a lack of vaccine supply.

Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said vaccinating 70 percent of the population by the spring, which experts say is the level required to end transmission of the virus, is unlikely without a considerable boost in supply.

""Right now, we don't have that,"" Spiro said. ""This is about scaling production so that we can achieve herd immunity as rapidly as possible.""

There are also concerns about looming syringe and needle shortages, Spiro said.

In July, Spiro co-wrote a comprehensive vaccine proposal with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a member of Biden's Covid-19 transition advisory board. Their blueprint calls for using the DPA to ""coordinate vaccine manufacturing capacity and supply chains"" for glass vials, syringes, needles and other supplies.

Spiro said the law would also help companies with existing manufacturing facilities prepare to handle mass production of vaccines. He cited the pharmaceutical giant Merck as a company with vast production capacity that could be used to produce another company's vaccine.

The DPA could also be used to mass-produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is expected to require one dose rather than the two-shot regimen required by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Spiro said.

Spiro said there are other ways to bolster vaccine and vaccine component supply without invoking the DPA, pointing to a facility at Texas A&M University already under contract to the government to mass-produce vaccines.",MSNBC,"['law', 'biden', 'production', 'aides', 'spiro', 'weighing', 'vaccines', 'manufacturing', 'pfizer', 'boosting', 'act', 'dpa', 'vaccine', 'trump', 'defense']",0

I’ve rejoiced at social media posts announcing a sibling, a partner or a best friend who’s first in line. “My sister, who’s been treating Covid patients this year and is spending the holidays alone to keep the rest of us safe, just told our fam group chat she’s getting the vaccine this week,” journalist Connie Wang tweeted. “The collective relief and joy we feel is inexplicable.”

We’re nearing the end of a movie whose driving narrative has been “get a vaccine!” The trials were successful, the FDA issued emergency use authorization, the world rejoiced, the first doses were administered in a flurry of joy — and then the credits rolled. Presumably, life goes back to normal. But when, and how?

Placing faith in an organized, efficient, timely distribution of the vaccine doesn’t just feel like folly. It feels psychologically reckless.

We’ve got not just one, but two viable vaccines (with a third reportedly pending). But like everything else related to the government’s handling of Covid-19, the plans for the vaccine’s distribution are opaque, piecemeal and largely delegated to the discretion of individual states. After the initial distribution to front-line health care workers, the next few months are poised to be a “veritable land rush for Covid shots” as various industries and employers lobby for their employees to be next in line.

You can use a tool like this one to try to figure out where you are in the prioritized list, but it’s all relative. If you live in my hometown of Lewiston, Idaho, and are over 65, there is a lot that depends on whether your health conditions qualify you as “high risk.” And then there’s all the mitigating factors: Will there be adequate refrigeration? How will we reach the population that isn’t already calling their doctors, eager to be first in line? Is there even a plan, let alone the sort of detailed, dynamic plan that a massive distribution requires? What about the equally important distribution of the second dose? As the writer Zeynep Tufekci recently put it, will the U.S. “snatch defeat from the jaws of vaccine victory?”

“Few people across the country have a clear idea of how exactly the Covid-19 vaccine supply chains will be organized,” Bruce Y. Lee, who has worked in vaccine distribution for over 15 years, recently wrote in StatNews. “Vaccine chains have historically been neglected and underappreciated.”

When I try to fast-forward the tape of this pandemic, I can’t make the scenes of the future into anything coherent.

Yes, a new administration will be in charge at the federal level. It’s comforting, even thrilling, that they believe in science — and have a comparatively detailed plan for how to combat the pandemic moving forward. But like so many other Americans, my faith in our government’s ability to successfully execute any plan in relation to the pandemic isn’t just compromised. It’s gone.

On the federal, state and local level, we’ve bungled testing and messaging. We’ve repeatedly privileged businesses over human life. Congress has failed to pass substantive, lasting relief for the millions of families who are suffering, experiencing food insecurity, or facing eviction. It’s taken months for people to access unemployment benefits through an understaffed, labyrinthian system.

Just recently, the public learned that the U.S. government had previously refused the option of purchasing an additional 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, raising questions of a potential “vaccine cliff” in which millions would wait — perhaps for months — for supply to catch up.

But to those with power, money and influence, rules can always be bent. California’s stern messaging about serving the neediest first hasn’t stopped the rich from trying to leap ahead of teachers, farmworkers and firefighters.

Dr. Jeff Toll, who has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the first hospitals to stock the vaccine, recalled a patient asking: “If I donate $25,000 to Cedars, would that help me get in line?’” Toll said no.

I know the pandemic will end. But I’m also mentally exhausted.

I believe in the vaccine. I will absolutely take it the second it’s available to me. I know the pandemic will end. But I’m also mentally exhausted. I have no room for dashed hopes, no tolerance for even more changed plans, other than my current plan, which is “have no plans.” Placing faith in an organized, efficient, timely distribution of the vaccine doesn’t just feel like folly. It feels psychologically reckless.

I’d love to speak cheerfully to my mom, who hasn’t been in a public space since March, about the future. I want to tell my friends who’ve been trying to juggle working from home with kids that relief was coming their way — or tell other friends that their restaurant jobs would be coming back soon. I wish I could feel even slightly confident that the trail race that just announced plans to be in-person in July would come to pass.

But more than 3,000 Americans are dying every day, in part because we still cannot agree, as a society, to adhere to guidelines as simple as wearing a mask or limiting the number of people in social gatherings. When protesters gather outside the homes of health officials in Boise to protest a mask mandate, even as the state’s hospitals face the prospect of rationing care, what cause do I have for hope or trust?

As the vaccination rolls out, we’ll have new guidelines to follow, new best practices to observe. But faith in the CDC and local health officials has been dangerously eroded. What stats should we follow, and where should we find them? Even epidemiologists have pretty wildly disparate ideas about risk, or when things will go back to normal, or what “normal” will even look like. And we’re only just beginning to grapple with the profound physical and psychological aftereffects of this pandemic.

Which helps explain why, when I try to fast-forward the tape of this pandemic, I can’t make the scenes of the future into anything coherent: Will we be wearing masks in public spaces for the foreseeable future? When’s the first time I’ll get on a plane? Eat dinner at a restaurant? When will I be able to forgive the people in my community who’ve behaved so recklessly, so selfishly, for so long? How will we reckon with our collective grief over more than 300,000 dead?

Our brains do their best to keep us going, day after day, week after week, through grave disappointment, trauma and failure. Right now, they’re trying to keep us going just a few months more. And the best way to keep us safe, at least in this moment, is to keep the future as blurry — but still bright — as possible.",MSNBC,"['world', 'postcovid19', 'relief', 'plans', 'prepare', 'health', 'feel', 'distribution', 'plan', 'pandemic', 'future', 'vaccine', 'week']",0
2020-12-24 13:01:03+00:00,19,"I suppose we should be grateful. Congress has finally reached a deal on a new round of coronavirus relief funding, nine months after the first package was signed into law and five months since the bulk of that funding ran out.

With this deal, an estimated 12 million Americans would avoid seeing their weekly incomes hit $0 as their unemployment benefits expired. Eviction protections would be renewed, keeping families from being taken to court and thrown into the streets soon after the holidays. And households that use SNAP benefits, aka food stamps, would get more loaded monthly onto their EBT cards until June.

This is all great news. Provisions in this bill are desperately needed to help bridge the gap until Covid-19 vaccines can be more widely distributed. But if that's the case ... why does this bill still feel like such a disappointment?

It may just be the holidays talking, but the watered-down, belated efforts in this new package feel like when you're a kid on Christmas morning, after you spent ages curating your wish list. You'd been diligent and thoughtful after combing through catalogs, ranking your preferences, denoting the prices for your pare — er, Santa, even keeping the price cap low so nothing felt too extravagant.

Now, as you open the presents under the tree, you see some pretty decent gifts, ones that you'll enjoy and appreciate. But the things from your actual list are smaller than you'd intended, in the right spirit but the wrong item — a pogo stick instead of Moon Shoes or a Lego X-Wing when the Millennium Falcon was at the top of your list — or they're missing altogether. Determined not to be a brat, you put on a brave face and smile, but the disappointment still stings.

We shouldn't pretend that $600 is a true lifeline, though, for people who have been unemployed for months or are working reduced hours

""You should be grateful that you got any presents at all"" — that's the lesson that we tend to teach letdown kids at Christmas, especially when times are hard. It's a very American moral, one that urges children not to be greedy, to be appreciative of the good in their lives and the spirit of the season. The analogy breaks down when you consider that times are not hard for everyone equally. And after months of delays, the people who need the most are getting less than before for entirely arbitrary reasons.

Consider unemployment benefits: People laid off in the pandemic would get a federal boost in their state unemployment checks after funding for the expansion ran out in July. People who are self-employed, work as freelancers or were mired in the gig economy, as well as those whose state benefits are running out, would still be able to draw checks, as well, rather than see the authorization for those programs expire at the end of the year. However, assistance for both groups would be slashed in half, to $300 extra a week. That's money that would keep some people from drowning entirely — but still leave many thrashing and straining.

Another round of individual checks would be going out, one of the last items agreed to in the negotiations, but these would be halved, too. The checks that would go out to Americans making $75,000 or less would be a relief for many. We shouldn't pretend that $600 is a true lifeline, though, for people who have been unemployed for months or are working reduced hours as the restaurant or the retail store where they work teetered on the edge of failure.

Compare that to European countries, most of which have subsidized workers' salaries rather than let people lose their jobs, as The Washington Post explained in October:

The basic model of the European programs, sometimes called short-time work, is that struggling employers can place their workers on either full or partial furloughs, while the government takes over most of the cost of their idled time. The aims are to keep paychecks flowing to anxious citizens, prevent otherwise sound businesses from going under, and avoid the need to hire and train new workers after a crisis recedes.

Democrats, who for months pushed back against Republican measures that they felt would unfairly benefit businesses at the expense of workers, are spinning this deal as both a major win and just the first of several major packages.

""We have now reached agreement on a bill that will crush the virus and put money in the pockets of working families who are struggling,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to her caucus Sunday, calling the bill ""an important initial step.""

I don't know whether I would go so far as ""crush the virus"" — that ship seems to have sailed a long time ago, without the kind of direct payments this deal comes nowhere close to providing. But framing it as an ""initial step"" is important messaging, one the Democrats clearly hope tamps down on some of the disappointment.

President-elect Joe Biden is expected to push for another package in the new Congress come January. Accordingly, Democrats have started reminding voters just what the deal could have looked like if they'd only had control of the Senate. Cue the reminders that Georgia's twin Senate runoff elections are in less than a month.

If Democrats controlled the Senate:



- the cash payments would be $1200 not $600

- there would be $175 billion, not $25 billion, to help people pay the rent

- there would be flexible money for states and cities and bonus checks for frontline workers

There's a lot in this package that would stanch some of the bleeding since this summer. So sure, hand out that $600. But should we be grateful that this is what we get after waiting for so long?

2020-12-24 08:02:05+00:00,34,"In surprising comments, President Donald Trump shredded a just-passed Covid-19 relief package Tuesday night, saying the legislation includes measures that have nothing to do with the pandemic and that it is too stingy with payments to average Americans.

""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 (direct payment) to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple,"" Trump said in a video posted to Twitter of him speaking from the White House.

""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package,"" said, adding, ""And maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done.""

Before Trump spoke, all signs and expectations had been that he intended to sign the relief bill as soon as it lands on his desk, possibly later this week. White House aides, in fact, said as much.

While Trump didn't explicitly say he would veto the legislation, his remarks suggested that he might. If he does, lawmakers might be able to override his veto, but if he simply refuses to sign it, the bill might die.

House Democrats, who had advocated higher direct checks only to encounter Republican resistance in the Senate, immediately said they welcomed Trump's support for sending out more money. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland tweeted that Democrats would try Thursday to pass a separate bill that would send out $2,000 direct payments. Because many members of the House are out of town, Hoyer said, leaders will try to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but that means any single member can kill it. The fate of such a bill is unclear in the Senate.

The legislation already passed by Congress included two bills that were combined: One was the Covid-19 relief and stimulus bill, and the other was a large spending bill to fund the government through next September. If the spending bill is not enacted into law, the government will have to shut down Monday.

In the four-minute video, Trump trashed the legislation for including, among other things, what he said was ""$85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia; $134 million to Burma; $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment; $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan; $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Forty million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which is not even open for business, $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art.""

All of those items were in the spending bill, not the Covid-19 bill, which Trump seemed to be conflating.

""This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending,"" Trump added.

Congress can't amend the bill now that it has been passed, and it would have to consider new legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats had fought to boost the direct payments to Americans in the face of GOP opposition.

We spent months trying to secure $2000 checks but Republicans blocked it



Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need



Maybe Trump can finally make himself useful and get Republicans not to block it again — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) December 23, 2020

The nearly $900 billion package, passed with bipartisan support, includes a new round of stimulus checks, an extension of unemployment benefits and more money for vaccines and education.

The legislation easily passed in the House — 359 to 53 — before it breezed through the Senate shortly before midnight Monday in a 92-6 vote.

The agreement includes stimulus checks of up to $600 per person for individuals earning $75,000 per year and married couples who earn up to $150,000, with $600 more for each dependent under 18 living in the same household.

It would also extend unemployment insurance and federal unemployment insurance — $300 a week — and provide over $284 billion more in loans for businesses struggling to pay rent and workers, $69 billion for testing and vaccine distribution and $82 billion for colleges and schools.

Because of the size of the 5,600-page bill and because government funding runs out at midnight, lawmakers attached a separate measure to avoid a government shutdown for seven days.

The Senate Historical Office said it appears to be the longest bill ever approved by Congress, The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers complained that they didn't have time to read through the legislation before the votes.

The direct payments would be smaller than the $1,200 checks people received when Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, called the CARES Act, in March to soften the early economic blow of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The enhanced unemployment benefits are also less than the $600 a week provided in that bill, which was the largest economic relief package in modern U.S. history.

Earlier, before Trump's attack on the measure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Americans would begin getting direct payments by ""the beginning of next week.""

Lawmakers had been at loggerheads over a second relief package for months as Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to rise during the holiday season, and many Americans and small-business owners are in dire financial straits. A recent study by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, for example, found that if direct unemployment aid was not extended, 5 million more people would enter poverty in January.

The parties worked out a deal that includes many of their top priorities. For Democrats, those included an extension of the moratorium on evictions and targeted funding for underrepresented groups, such as Native American and other minority communities. House Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to limits on benefits for undocumented immigrants and food stamp payments as wins.

The legislation does not include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare or relief for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic. Republicans pushed for liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers, but that was also left out.

Schumer criticized Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Monday, saying more aid is needed.

""This bill cannot and will not be the final word upon congressional relief from the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""This is an emergency survival package, and when we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left by the bill and get the economy moving with strong federal input.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'payments', 'passed', 'blasts', 'relief', 'legislation', 'billion', 'package', 'unemployment', 'congress', 'direct', 'million', 'changes', 'demands', 'trump', 'covid']",0

2020-12-23 23:27:03+00:00,61,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threw a wrench into the massive year-end spending and coronavirus relief bill, leaving the country on edge as the threat of a government shutdown and expiring Covid-19 protections loom over the holiday season.

Trump said in a video posted to his Twitter account that the bill passed on Monday contained too many provisions unrelated to the pandemic and complained that the direct payments to Americans were too low.

But if Trump doesn't sign the bill, it will likely delay Americans getting any checks, shut the government down and allow some other coronavirus relief programs to expire.

Trump's comments sent Washington spiraling into chaos after lawmakers spent months hashing out a deal on the largest piece of legislation in 2020 and left many frustrated that Trump waited so long to voice his concerns after largely sitting out the negotiation process.

No one is quite sure how things will play out.

Trump has been known to create a public spectacle only to later back down. But it is unclear what is motivating the president in the final few days of his term. And after weeks of threatening to veto the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, on Wednesday he delivered on that threat.

There are a few different scenarios for what could come next.

Trump could sign the bill after all

The easiest way for things to end is if the president ultimately decides to sign the bill once it reaches his desk later this week.

Trump will be under pressure to make a move quickly, as the government is currently only funded through Monday night and a handful of coronavirus relief programs, such as enhanced unemployment, are set to expire right after Christmas Day.

Trump could veto the bill

A presidential veto would set up for a showdown between the White House and Congress. It is unlikely Trump would win.

It takes two-thirds of the members voting in the House and the Senate to override a presidential veto and both chambers voted to pass the bipartisan bill with strong majorities.

While many Republicans have spent the past four years avoiding conflict with the president, there is little appetite for a government shutdown during a raging pandemic.

If Congress were unable to override Trump's veto, they would be left to pass an intermediate funding bill to keep the government running. Coronavirus relief would probably be put on hold until President-elect Joe Biden took the White House.

Although some viewed Trump's Tuesday night comments as a bluff, the president followed through with his threat to veto the annual defense spending bill on Wednesday, raising concerns that he would do the same with the Covid-19 bill.

If lawmakers return to Washington to override Trump's defense bill veto, they could quickly pivot to overriding the Covid-19 bill veto if needed.

Trump could pocket veto the bill

The president might chose to just not sign the bill, effectively killing it in a process known as a pocket veto.

Usually if a president fails to sign a bill within ten days of its passage then it automatically becomes law. But if Congress adjourns before the president has signed the bill and the president decides not to sign it, then the bill does not become law. Its been more than 20 years since the pocket veto was utilized.

Congress has already returned home for the holidays, so this is an option for Trump. The pocket veto is absolute, meaning Congress does not have the opportunity to override it like they do for a regular veto.

In this scenario, Congress would again be forced to pass an intermediate government funding bill and coronavirus relief would likely be sidelined.

What about increasing the stimulus checks to $2,000?

In the video Trump posted to Twitter on Tuesday night, his main complaint was that the $600 stimulus checks included in the bill were too small, arguing that qualifying individuals should receive $2,000 and couples should get $4,000.

Democrats immediately got behind Trump, although amending the legislation this late in the game is not possible.

Instead, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she would bring up a new bill on Thursday to increase the direct payments.

Pelosi's efforts are likely to fall flat among Republicans who were already resistant to the $600 checks.

2020-12-23 22:48:02+00:00,29,"ROME — Five hundred families of coronavirus victims are taking legal action against Italy's regional and national governments, whom they deem responsible for a series of omissions, mistakes and delays during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The families say the national government and regional authorities in the hard-hit Lombardy region were unprepared for the crisis as the virus hit and did not take actions that could have prevented a national lockdown and subsequent economic damage, as well as loss of life.

Italy became one of the early epicenters of the pandemic, with its health care system pushed to the breaking point. Nearly 70,000 people died from coronavirus in Italy so far, the highest fatality count in Europe.

“These complaints are our Christmas present to those who should have done what they were supposed to do and did not do while in Italy, on December 25, there will be 70,000 empty chairs,” Luca Fusco, president of coronavirus advocacy group Noi Denunceremo, or We Will Denounce, that has launched the lawsuit, said in a statement.

“With proper planning, as requested over and over again by the E.U. and WHO, we are sure there would have been many fewer,” Fusco added.

The lawsuit names Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, president of Lombardy region Attilio Fontana and health minister Roberto Speranza.

McRae’s oxygen levels that August evening had dropped to a level that could incur brain damage. Newton’s mother never returned home after testing positive for Covid-19 at the hospital. Seventy-two days later in November, she died at the same hospital where she had treated coronavirus patients.

“I was literally watching her deteriorate slowly,” Newton said of her mom, whom she called her best friend and hero. “She was losing everything that I've ever seen in my mom. My mom is the strongest human being in the world and that was just slowly being sucked out of her by this virus.”

What bothers Newton is that no one knows exactly how many health care workers, like her mom, have died of the coronavirus — thus quantifying in some way the sacrifices they made and the suffering they experienced from a disease they worked so hard to defeat.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

As the U.S. Covid-19 death toll continues to mount, the deaths of front-line health care workers remain largely unaccounted for. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and support staff have courageously taken on enormous risk during the pandemic, the most consuming health crisis in more than 100 years, but there is no specific death count for them. These are the same people who have received rounds of applause at the end of their shifts and plaudits from the president and high-ranking members of government and industry.

That hits Newton particularly hard.

One of the last times she saw her mom, Newton shared the news that she had passed her board certifying test to become a registered nurse. Now working at a hospital in New Orleans, she is striving to follow in her mom’s footsteps and make sure her hero is remembered.

“We don’t even know what or who we’ve lost,” Newton said. “My mom served through this pandemic. She helped these people, and if my family hadn’t said anything, they would’ve just said she’s another number.”

Calculating the exact number of U.S. health care workers who have died of Covid-19 and related complications is not easy and is getting harder as time moves on. There is no accurate or central database with that information.

Dr. Claire Rezba, an anesthesiologist in Virginia, has kept a national tally that she has published on her Twitter account since March, when the pandemic began to sweep across the United States.

I don't think that the health care systems have done a service by not publicizing what's going on inside their walls.

She maintains her count using obituaries, media reports, social media, memorials and any other means she can find. Rezba tweets about the deaths of nurses, doctors, emergency medical technicians, specialists and members of staff every day.

Her count has reached nearly 1,700, a figure she’s certain is conservative.

“Every time I feel like it's time to stop — because it's hurting me, there's an aspect of this that hurts — I'll see another story or some posts,” Rezba said. “And I think, ‘Well, just this one more. I just have to make sure that people see this one more.’”

“It seems like there’s nobody else to really take the lead on it,” she added. “It shouldn’t be me. I mean, this is ridiculous. Really, it’s ridiculous.”

A September report by the National Nurses United, a nursing union, had an estimate that is slightly higher than Rezba’s at a little over 1,700 deaths among health care workers since the start of the pandemic.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest tally, as of Dec. 22, is 955 deaths and more than 288,000 infections of health care personnel. Of those cases of Covid-19 among health care workers, the CDC has only confirmed 75.7 percent of the time whether or not that doctor, nurse, paramedic or member of support staff died.

A spokesperson for Health and Human Services said the numbers were not comprehensive and noted that state health departments may have more accurate data.

Critics of the federal coronavirus response say the national count may be hampered by White House meddling. The administration announced its decision very suddenly in July to have the Department of Health and Human Services take over hospital coronavirus data collection from the CDC, making it difficult to follow hospital trends and data reporting.

“There is widespread resistance on the part of the health care industry to transparently provide information on nurse and other health care worker fatalities due to Covid-19,” the National Nurses United said in its study. “At the same time, federal, state, and local governments have failed to compel health care facilities to provide this data.”

It’s difficult to know which count is correct. Only 15 states provide the infection number for health care workers on a weekly basis, according to the nursing union, and it wasn’t until May that nursing homes were required to provide its workers’ infection and mortality information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

While the public can now access that information from nursing homes, hospitals are not required to share their data.

“I don't think that the health care systems have done a service by not publicizing what's going on inside their walls,” Rezba said. “A lot of the deaths that I find for health care workers are really kind of secretive. They're swept under the rug.”

Rezba emphasized that those deaths also include the loss of an immense amount of expertise and knowledge that these health care workers had.

Newton said that was true of her mother, a nurse with decades of experience, who taught her elements of nursing she said she could never have learned in school.

“My mom fought 100 percent tooth and nail for her patients,” she said. “And we’ve lost that, society has lost that — we’ve lost someone who would have fought for everyone and anyone she came in contact with.”

The last time Newton was able to see her mom, the latter couldn’t speak because of the tubes in her mouth, but McRae acknowledged the news that her daughter had passed the nursing board exam.

“She was responsive, but she lost it,” Newton said between sobs. “She just wasn’t there anymore.”

The federal government does not require hospitals to provide data on health care workers’ infection and mortality rates and there is no central reporting structure for it to be housed, said Katherine Hancock, the chief caregiver officer at the Cleveland Clinic, who oversees 70,000 health care workers.

The Cleveland Clinic tracks outbreaks within its medical facilities, she said. It reports those figures and supports its staff through hospitalizations and quarantines. So far, it has had one death, but the staff remains overwhelmed physically and emotionally by the pandemic.

“We track it and talk about this all day: Not only are we obviously looking out for our patients, but we're also looking at the number of caregivers who are out due to Covid-19, those who are positive, those who are in the hospital and those who've returned to work,” Hancock said. “So we have a very good handle to be honest with you, and I don't know why others have had such difficulty.”

Without anyone tracking these deaths, it is left to families, friends and communities who have lost loved ones who were health care workers to ensure that their sacrifices aren’t forgotten.

I’m not sure if it will actually make it here by Dec. 25 — and I can’t say that I’m surprised. Or, for that matter, all that upset.

The author’s dilemma, circa Dec. 23, 2020.

You see, the package I’m waiting for is being shipped via the United States Postal Service and to say that the boys and girls in blue have had a hard year would be a severe understatement. Any inconvenience we, the consumers and customers of the Postal Service, have experienced this holiday season is a drop in the bucket compared to what they’ve gone through at post offices around the country.

As the packages piled up, so did the coronavirus cases in the packed sorting warehouses, where sorters showed up despite showing symptoms for fear of losing their jobs.

Remember what it was like when the pandemic kicked off in March and stay-at-home orders went out in a bunch of states? The rush of people turning to online shopping — both to keep from going outside and as a mental balm against the crushing ennui that Covid-19 inspired — and the resulting crunch left the delivery drivers at the USPS, FedEx and UPS all nearly broken under the weight of the collective tonnage of our purchases.

As the packages piled up, so did the coronavirus cases in the packed sorting warehouses, where sorters showed up despite showing symptoms for fear of losing their jobs. But while parcel shipping increased, regular mail plummeted, putting the Postal Service in a bind. Already by April, there were warnings that the USPS would run out of cash entirely before September.

Complicating things further was the war against the Postal Service that President Donald Trump launched as part of his re-election bid. Trump argued early and often that mail-in voting was rife with fraud, using this blatant lie as a reason to not provide more funding to the USPS. Congress eventually managed to get a sizable loan to a stabilizing Postal Service but not without strings. And the struggles it’s facing financially aren’t going away anytime soon.

Trump also named shipping executive Louis DeJoy as the new US Postmaster General, which only added to the chaos. DeJoy instituted changes that he and his defenders claimed were meant to maximize productivity from postal workers. Instead, his orders, including dismantling sorting machines and ordering mail workers not to finish delivering every item on their route by the end of their shift, made things worse. (DeJoy rolled back many of those changes in September in response to the outcry.)

There are currently about 641,000 postal workers working out of 31,500 facilities. Of those, nearly 19,000 have called in sick or are isolating.

Thankfully the Postal Service came through for the election, despite Trump’s best efforts. But now things are hellacious as the Christmas surge has hit, despite retailers encouraging early shopping. UPS and FedEx basically saw this coming — the former placed shipping limits on some of the biggest retailers this season to keep performance levels high. The effect, though, has been the overflow going to USPS, which already handles an estimated 40 percent of Amazon’s deliveries and the so-called “last-mile” of the private companies’ deliveries in rural areas.

“The plant’s so backed up that they’re sending raw unsorted mail, whole trays to carriers to manually sort and case ourselves,” Alex Fields, a rural letter carrier In Knoxville, Tennessee told Labor Notes. “Everyone’s spending an hour a day just casing up mail that’s supposed to be run through a machine, because there’s no one to run the machine. That’s on top of having 400 packages to deliver on your route.”

The backlog has become so severe that in some facilities employees are basically forced to craft tunnels out of the boxes, according to new reporting from the Washington Post.

“Some processing plants are now refusing to accept new mail shipments. The backlogs are so pronounced that some managers have reached out to colleagues in hopes of diverting mail shipments to nearby facilities. But often, those places are full, too. Meanwhile, packages sit on trucks for days waiting for floor space to open so the loads can be sorted.”

This is why your packages are still ""in transit,"" and why it won't be helpful to call with your tracking number. USPS package volumes are up 30-40%.

Having that little space to maneuver makes it hard to keep away from coworkers, raising the risk of spreading the coronavirus no matter how many guidelines the Postal Service puts into place. There are currently about 641,000 postal workers working out of 31,500 facilities, according to the USPS’s Office of the Inspector General.

2020-12-23 15:44:03+00:00,22,"The new report from the Labor Department on weekly unemployment claims found 803,000 new filings last week, which was an improvement over some recent reports, though the total is still higher than the tallies from October and November.

As discouraging as it is to see stubbornly high numbers of Americans seeking unemployment benefits, struggling families could take some comfort in the fact that help is on the way: after months of effort, Congress this week approved an economic relief package that would extend lifelines to those in need. The White House left no doubt that Donald Trump would sign the bill into law.

Everything appeared to be more or less fine -- until last night, when the outgoing president publicly condemned the aid package that's awaiting his signature.

""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 (direct payment) to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple,"" Trump said in a video posted to Twitter showing him speaking from the White House..... ""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package,"" Trump said....

The Republican quickly added that the next administration might be his, which served as a reminder that he's still looking for ways to hold illegitimate power despite losing the national election.

As part of the scripted tirade -- these were written remarks, not offhand comments -- Trump went so far as to describe the bipartisan compromise as ""a disgrace.""

The outgoing president's harangue reportedly ""stunned"" some White House officials, which was the appropriate reaction: it was just a few days ago when Team Trump praised the relief package and assured everyone involved that the president would sign it into law. It's one of the reason the legislation passed so easily, with 359 votes in the House, and 92 votes in the Senate.

And yet, here we are.

At this point, the main problem appears to be direct-aid payments. Congressional Democrats proposed checks as high as $1,200, while GOP leaders initially opposed direct-aid payments altogether. As part of the compromise, lawmakers agreed on $600 payments.

As of late yesterday, Trump apparently believes his own party is wrong, prompting Democrats to announce plans to try to approve a direct-aid bill more in line with the president's -- and their own -- preferred approach. Whether congressional Republicans will go along is unclear.

Either way, the president had plenty of time to make these demands before the bill passed. It need not have been complicated: Trump simply had to say that he would oppose a relief plan unless it included $2,000 direct-aid checks. He could've picked up the phone and talked to his GOP allies on the Hill; he could've said something in a tweet; he could've alerted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to his wishes.

Instead, Trump waited until the bill was done and approved -- by way of a process he deliberately ignored and refused to participate in -- at which point the erratic president decided he didn't like the compromise endorsed by his team after all.

But let's not lose sight of the extraordinary landscape. Trump has until today to follow through on his threat to veto funding for the U.S. military. He's also now eyeing a possible veto of this week's package, which includes both an economic relief plan and funding for the government through the end of the fiscal year. This is unfolding, naturally, the week of Christmas, with most lawmakers in their home districts.

If the Republican president stays on this course, millions of Americans will lose federal unemployment aid the day after Christmas and the government will shut down a few days later. We might also soon see Congress vote twice to override Trump vetoes -- once on the NDAA package for the military, and then again for the relief package the president considers a ""disgrace.""

No one can say with confidence what will happen next, but there are millions of American families in need of a lifeline who are left to wonder what kind of chaos Trump will create next.",MSNBC,"['bill', 'relief', 'package', 'president', 'unemployment', 'claims', 'house', 'economic', 'slams', 'directaid', 'congress', 'white', 'high', 'amid', 'trump', 'week']",0

Remember what it was like when the pandemic kicked off in March and stay-at-home orders went out in a bunch of states? The rush of people turning to online shopping — both to keep from going outside and as a mental balm against the crushing ennui that Covid-19 inspired — and the resulting crunch left the delivery drivers at the USPS, FedEx and UPS all nearly broken under the weight of the collective tonnage of our purchases.

As the packages piled up, so did the coronavirus cases in the packed sorting warehouses, where sorters showed up despite showing symptoms for fear of losing their jobs. But while parcel shipping increased, regular mail plummeted, putting the Postal Service in a bind. Already by April, there were warnings that the USPS would run out of cash entirely before September.

Complicating things further was the war against the Postal Service that President Donald Trump launched as part of his re-election bid. Trump argued early and often that mail-in voting was rife with fraud, using this blatant lie as a reason to not provide more funding to the USPS. Congress eventually managed to get a sizable loan to a stabilizing Postal Service but not without strings. And the struggles it’s facing financially aren’t going away anytime soon.

Trump also named shipping executive Louis DeJoy as the new US Postmaster General, which only added to the chaos. DeJoy instituted changes that he and his defenders claimed were meant to maximize productivity from postal workers. Instead, his orders, including dismantling sorting machines and ordering mail workers not to finish delivering every item on their route by the end of their shift, made things worse. (DeJoy rolled back many of those changes in September in response to the outcry.)

There are currently about 641,000 postal workers working out of 31,500 facilities. Of those, nearly 19,000 have called in sick or are isolating.

Thankfully the Postal Service came through for the election, despite Trump’s best efforts. But now things are hellacious as the Christmas surge has hit, despite retailers encouraging early shopping. UPS and FedEx basically saw this coming — the former placed shipping limits on some of the biggest retailers this season to keep performance levels high. The effect, though, has been the overflow going to USPS, which already handles an estimated 40 percent of Amazon’s deliveries and the so-called “last-mile” of the private companies’ deliveries in rural areas.

“The plant’s so backed up that they’re sending raw unsorted mail, whole trays to carriers to manually sort and case ourselves,” Alex Fields, a rural letter carrier In Knoxville, Tennessee told Labor Notes. “Everyone’s spending an hour a day just casing up mail that’s supposed to be run through a machine, because there’s no one to run the machine. That’s on top of having 400 packages to deliver on your route.”

The backlog has become so severe that in some facilities employees are basically forced to craft tunnels out of the boxes, according to new reporting from the Washington Post.

“Some processing plants are now refusing to accept new mail shipments. The backlogs are so pronounced that some managers have reached out to colleagues in hopes of diverting mail shipments to nearby facilities. But often, those places are full, too. Meanwhile, packages sit on trucks for days waiting for floor space to open so the loads can be sorted.”

This is why your packages are still ""in transit,"" and why it won't be helpful to call with your tracking number. USPS package volumes are up 30-40%.

2020-12-23 13:29:37+00:00,12,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it will buy an additional 100 million doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine, ensuring that every American who wants to be vaccinated can be by June.

The announcement from the Department of Health and Human Services said that Pfizer will manufacture and deliver up to 100 million doses of the vaccine to government-designated locations. This comes on top of the 100 million doses already purchased by the U.S. government.

Under the agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by the end of June and 30 million by the end of July. This expands the total number of Pfizer vaccine doses purchased by the federal government to 200 million, HHS said.

""Securing more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech for delivery in the second quarter of 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio,"" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Wednesday. ""This new federal purchase can give Americans even more confidence that we will have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 2021.""

The incoming Biden administration will be responsible, however, for disseminating the vaccine to the public next year. Biden takes office Jan. 20.

The Food and Drug Administration recently authorized the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use, and it was delivered to many health care facilities last week for the first shots to be administered to front-line workers. The FDA then approved a similar Covid-19 vaccine from the biotechnology company Moderna last week and distribution began on Monday.

The administration's new agreement comes as hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. wait to be vaccinated. Earlier this month, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and a member of Pfizer's board of directors, said that the White House had declined ""multiple"" offers from the company to strike a deal on more vaccine doses for the second quarter of 2021.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'administration', 'supply', 'govt', 'doses', 'buy', '100', 'pfizer', 'million', 'additional', 'vaccinated', 'vaccine', 'wants', 'week', 'agrees']",0

""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 (direct payment) to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple,"" Trump said in a video posted to Twitter of him speaking from the White House.

""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package,"" said, adding, ""And maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done.""

Before Trump spoke, all signs and expectations had been that he intended to sign the relief bill as soon as it lands on his desk, possibly later this week. White House aides, in fact, said as much.

While Trump didn't explicitly say he would veto the legislation, his remarks suggested that he might. If he does, lawmakers might be able to override his veto, but if he simply refuses to sign it, the bill might die.

House Democrats, who had advocated higher direct checks only to encounter Republican resistance in the Senate, immediately said they welcomed Trump's support for sending out more money. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland tweeted that Democrats would try Thursday to pass a separate bill that would send out $2,000 direct payments. Because many members of the House are out of town, Hoyer said, leaders will try to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but that means any single member can kill it. The fate of such a bill is unclear in the Senate.

The legislation already passed by Congress included two bills that were combined: One was the Covid-19 relief and stimulus bill, and the other was a large spending bill to fund the government through next September. If the spending bill is not enacted into law, the government will have to shut down Monday.

In the four-minute video, Trump trashed the legislation for including, among other things, what he said was ""$85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia; $134 million to Burma; $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment; $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan; $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Forty million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which is not even open for business, $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art.""

All of those items were in the spending bill, not the Covid-19 bill, which Trump seemed to be conflating.

""This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending,"" Trump added.

Congress can't amend the bill now that it has been passed, and it would have to consider new legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats had fought to boost the direct payments to Americans in the face of GOP opposition.

The nearly $900 billion package, passed with bipartisan support, includes a new round of stimulus checks, an extension of unemployment benefits and more money for vaccines and education.

The legislation easily passed in the House — 359 to 53 — before it breezed through the Senate shortly before midnight Monday in a 92-6 vote.

The agreement includes stimulus checks of up to $600 per person for individuals earning $75,000 per year and married couples who earn up to $150,000, with $600 more for each dependent under 18 living in the same household.

It would also extend unemployment insurance and federal unemployment insurance — $300 a week — and provide over $284 billion more in loans for businesses struggling to pay rent and workers, $69 billion for testing and vaccine distribution and $82 billion for colleges and schools.

Because of the size of the 5,600-page bill and because government funding runs out at midnight, lawmakers attached a separate measure to avoid a government shutdown for seven days.

The Senate Historical Office said it appears to be the longest bill ever approved by Congress, The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers complained that they didn't have time to read through the legislation before the votes.

The direct payments would be smaller than the $1,200 checks people received when Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, called the CARES Act, in March to soften the early economic blow of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The enhanced unemployment benefits are also less than the $600 a week provided in that bill, which was the largest economic relief package in modern U.S. history.

Earlier, before Trump's attack on the measure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Americans would begin getting direct payments by ""the beginning of next week.""

Lawmakers had been at loggerheads over a second relief package for months as Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to rise during the holiday season, and many Americans and small-business owners are in dire financial straits. A recent study by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, for example, found that if direct unemployment aid was not extended, 5 million more people would enter poverty in January.

The parties worked out a deal that includes many of their top priorities. For Democrats, those included an extension of the moratorium on evictions and targeted funding for underrepresented groups, such as Native American and other minority communities. House Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to limits on benefits for undocumented immigrants and food stamp payments as wins.

The legislation does not include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare or relief for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic. Republicans pushed for liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers, but that was also left out.

Schumer criticized Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Monday, saying more aid is needed.

""This bill cannot and will not be the final word upon congressional relief from the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""This is an emergency survival package, and when we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left by the bill and get the economy moving with strong federal input.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'payments', 'passed', 'blasts', 'relief', 'legislation', 'billion', 'package', 'unemployment', 'congress', 'direct', 'million', 'changes', 'demands', 'trump', 'covid']",0

2020-12-23 09:05:06+00:00,117,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus advisory team consulted scientists and supply chain experts about whether he should invoke a wartime production law to help produce and administer more Covid-19 vaccines, two advisers familiar with the discussions said.

President Donald Trump has already invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, to speed the production of medical supplies and components to test for the coronavirus, and he has raised the possibility of using the law again for vaccines. Manufacturers have said there could be a shortage of components to make the vaccines.

The DPA was enacted during the Korean War to allow the federal government to compel manufacturing production for national defense. Biden's team has explored using it soon after he takes office next month to try to meet the goal of mass vaccination by summer, the advisers said.

Biden's aides have already begun to warn that the Trump administration's timeline projecting mass vaccination in the spring may be too optimistic, carrying the risk that Biden will be blamed when expectations aren't met. Whether to invoke the DPA to speed production could be an early test for Biden.

Scientists are advising the Biden team about how the DPA could ""enhance parts of the manufacturing process,"" one of the advisers said, declining to be more specific.

As part of negotiations to sell 100 million more vaccine doses to Americans, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has pressed the Trump administration to activate the DPA. Pfizer, working with its partner BioNTech, and Moderna are the only companies that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S.

A Pfizer spokesperson said the company continues to work with the government and is confident that it can ""remove any obstacle that may present itself as we work to ramp up manufacturing to deliver any additional doses.""

Teresa Davis, a senior White House communications adviser, said the Trump administration has already invoked the DPA for some aspects of vaccine production and is actively discussing the issue with Pfizer.

""We are working closely with Pfizer and other manufacturers to ensure that all obstacles to production are removed so that the American people receive vaccines as rapidly as possible,"" David said. ""In addition, 23 manufacturing sites were set up just for Operation Warp Speed to help scale industrial production of the vaccine.""

But Biden officials say a range of serious issues must be considered before they can use the law. A primary concern, an official said, would be how to invoke the law in an equitable way that doesn't favor one company over another.

Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, two other pharmaceutical companies, are in the final phases of testing vaccines, and they expect to be completed and apply for emergency use authorization in February.

Dr. Brett Giroir, who has been leading vaccine testing efforts for the Trump administration, said the majority of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer. But Biden officials say many obstacles stand in the way, primarily a lack of vaccine supply.

Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said vaccinating 70 percent of the population by the spring, which experts say is the level required to end transmission of the virus, is unlikely without a considerable boost in supply.

""Right now, we don't have that,"" Spiro said. ""This is about scaling production so that we can achieve herd immunity as rapidly as possible.""

There are also concerns about looming syringe and needle shortages, Spiro said.

In July, Spiro co-wrote a comprehensive vaccine proposal with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a member of Biden's Covid-19 transition advisory board. Their blueprint calls for using the DPA to ""coordinate vaccine manufacturing capacity and supply chains"" for glass vials, syringes, needles and other supplies.

Spiro said the law would also help companies with existing manufacturing facilities prepare to handle mass production of vaccines. He cited the pharmaceutical giant Merck as a company with vast production capacity that could be used to produce another company's vaccine.

The DPA could also be used to mass-produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is expected to require one dose rather than the two-shot regimen required by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Spiro said.

Spiro said there are other ways to bolster vaccine and vaccine component supply without invoking the DPA, pointing to a facility at Texas A&M University already under contract to the government to mass-produce vaccines.",MSNBC,"['law', 'biden', 'production', 'aides', 'spiro', 'weighing', 'vaccines', 'manufacturing', 'pfizer', 'boosting', 'act', 'dpa', 'vaccine', 'trump', 'defense']",0

The Senate Historical Office said it appears to be the longest bill ever approved by Congress, The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers complained that they didn't have time to read through the legislation before the votes.

The direct payments would be smaller than the $1,200 checks people received when Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, called the CARES Act, in March to soften the early economic blow of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The enhanced unemployment benefits are also less than the $600 a week provided in that bill, which was the largest economic relief package in modern U.S. history.

Earlier, before Trump's attack on the measure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Americans would begin getting direct payments by ""the beginning of next week.""

Lawmakers had been at loggerheads over a second relief package for months as Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to rise during the holiday season, and many Americans and small-business owners are in dire financial straits. A recent study by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, for example, found that if direct unemployment aid was not extended, 5 million more people would enter poverty in January.

The parties worked out a deal that includes many of their top priorities. For Democrats, those included an extension of the moratorium on evictions and targeted funding for underrepresented groups, such as Native American and other minority communities. House Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to limits on benefits for undocumented immigrants and food stamp payments as wins.

The legislation does not include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare or relief for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic. Republicans pushed for liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers, but that was also left out.

Schumer criticized Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Monday, saying more aid is needed.

""This bill cannot and will not be the final word upon congressional relief from the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""This is an emergency survival package, and when we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left by the bill and get the economy moving with strong federal input.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'payments', 'passed', 'blasts', 'relief', 'legislation', 'billion', 'package', 'unemployment', 'congress', 'direct', 'million', 'changes', 'demands', 'trump', 'covid']",0

2020-12-23 01:03:04+00:00,67,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus advisory team consulted scientists and supply chain experts about whether he should invoke a wartime production law to help produce and administer more Covid-19 vaccines, two advisers familiar with the discussions said.

President Donald Trump has already invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, to speed the production of medical supplies and components to test for the coronavirus, and he has raised the possibility of using the law again for vaccines. Manufacturers have said there could be a shortage of components to make the vaccines.

The DPA was enacted during the Korean War to allow the federal government to compel manufacturing production for national defense. Biden's team has explored using it soon after he takes office next month to try to meet the goal of mass vaccination by summer, the advisers said.

Biden's aides have already begun to warn that the Trump administration's timeline projecting mass vaccination in the spring may be too optimistic, carrying the risk that Biden will be blamed when expectations aren't met. Whether to invoke the DPA to speed production could be an early test for Biden.

Scientists are advising the Biden team about how the DPA could ""enhance parts of the manufacturing process,"" one of the advisers said, declining to be more specific.

As part of negotiations to sell 100 million more vaccine doses to Americans, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has pressed the Trump administration to activate the DPA. Pfizer, working with its partner BioNTech, and Moderna are the only companies that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S.

A Pfizer spokesperson said the company continues to work with the government and is confident that it can ""remove any obstacle that may present itself as we work to ramp up manufacturing to deliver any additional doses.""

Teresa Davis, a senior White House communications adviser, said the Trump administration has already invoked the DPA for some aspects of vaccine production and is actively discussing the issue with Pfizer.

""We are working closely with Pfizer and other manufacturers to ensure that all obstacles to production are removed so that the American people receive vaccines as rapidly as possible,"" David said. ""In addition, 23 manufacturing sites were set up just for Operation Warp Speed to help scale industrial production of the vaccine.""

But Biden officials say a range of serious issues must be considered before they can use the law. A primary concern, an official said, would be how to invoke the law in an equitable way that doesn't favor one company over another.

Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, two other pharmaceutical companies, are in the final phases of testing vaccines, and they expect to be completed and apply for emergency use authorization in February.

Dr. Brett Giroir, who has been leading vaccine testing efforts for the Trump administration, said the majority of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer. But Biden officials say many obstacles stand in the way, primarily a lack of vaccine supply.

Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said vaccinating 70 percent of the population by the spring, which experts say is the level required to end transmission of the virus, is unlikely without a considerable boost in supply.

""Right now, we don't have that,"" Spiro said. ""This is about scaling production so that we can achieve herd immunity as rapidly as possible.""

There are also concerns about looming syringe and needle shortages, Spiro said.

In July, Spiro co-wrote a comprehensive vaccine proposal with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a member of Biden's Covid-19 transition advisory board. Their blueprint calls for using the DPA to ""coordinate vaccine manufacturing capacity and supply chains"" for glass vials, syringes, needles and other supplies.

Spiro said the law would also help companies with existing manufacturing facilities prepare to handle mass production of vaccines. He cited the pharmaceutical giant Merck as a company with vast production capacity that could be used to produce another company's vaccine.

The DPA could also be used to mass-produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is expected to require one dose rather than the two-shot regimen required by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Spiro said.

Spiro said there are other ways to bolster vaccine and vaccine component supply without invoking the DPA, pointing to a facility at Texas A&M University already under contract to the government to mass-produce vaccines.",MSNBC,"['law', 'biden', 'production', 'aides', 'spiro', 'weighing', 'vaccines', 'manufacturing', 'pfizer', 'boosting', 'act', 'dpa', 'vaccine', 'trump', 'defense']",0

2020-12-22 16:38:06+00:00,26,"I suppose we should be grateful. Congress has finally reached a deal on a new round of coronavirus relief funding, nine months after the first package was signed into law and five months since the bulk of that funding ran out.

With this deal, an estimated 12 million Americans would avoid seeing their weekly incomes hit $0 as their unemployment benefits expired. Eviction protections would be renewed, keeping families from being taken to court and thrown into the streets soon after the holidays. And households that use SNAP benefits, aka food stamps, would get more loaded monthly onto their EBT cards until June.

This is all great news. Provisions in this bill are desperately needed to help bridge the gap until Covid-19 vaccines can be more widely distributed. But if that's the case ... why does this bill still feel like such a disappointment?

It may just be the holidays talking, but the watered-down, belated efforts in this new package feel like when you're a kid on Christmas morning, after you spent ages curating your wish list. You'd been diligent and thoughtful after combing through catalogs, ranking your preferences, denoting the prices for your pare — er, Santa, even keeping the price cap low so nothing felt too extravagant.

Now, as you open the presents under the tree, you see some pretty decent gifts, ones that you'll enjoy and appreciate. But the things from your actual list are smaller than you'd intended, in the right spirit but the wrong item — a pogo stick instead of Moon Shoes or a Lego X-Wing when the Millennium Falcon was at the top of your list — or they're missing altogether. Determined not to be a brat, you put on a brave face and smile, but the disappointment still stings.

We shouldn't pretend that $600 is a true lifeline, though, for people who have been unemployed for months or are working reduced hours

""You should be grateful that you got any presents at all"" — that's the lesson that we tend to teach letdown kids at Christmas, especially when times are hard. It's a very American moral, one that urges children not to be greedy, to be appreciative of the good in their lives and the spirit of the season. The analogy breaks down when you consider that times are not hard for everyone equally. And after months of delays, the people who need the most are getting less than before for entirely arbitrary reasons.

Consider unemployment benefits: People laid off in the pandemic would get a federal boost in their state unemployment checks after funding for the expansion ran out in July. People who are self-employed, work as freelancers or were mired in the gig economy, as well as those whose state benefits are running out, would still be able to draw checks, as well, rather than see the authorization for those programs expire at the end of the year. However, assistance for both groups would be slashed in half, to $300 extra a week. That's money that would keep some people from drowning entirely — but still leave many thrashing and straining.

Another round of individual checks would be going out, one of the last items agreed to in the negotiations, but these would be halved, too. The checks that would go out to Americans making $75,000 or less would be a relief for many. We shouldn't pretend that $600 is a true lifeline, though, for people who have been unemployed for months or are working reduced hours as the restaurant or the retail store where they work teetered on the edge of failure.

Compare that to European countries, most of which have subsidized workers' salaries rather than let people lose their jobs, as The Washington Post explained in October:

The basic model of the European programs, sometimes called short-time work, is that struggling employers can place their workers on either full or partial furloughs, while the government takes over most of the cost of their idled time. The aims are to keep paychecks flowing to anxious citizens, prevent otherwise sound businesses from going under, and avoid the need to hire and train new workers after a crisis recedes.

Democrats, who for months pushed back against Republican measures that they felt would unfairly benefit businesses at the expense of workers, are spinning this deal as both a major win and just the first of several major packages.

""We have now reached agreement on a bill that will crush the virus and put money in the pockets of working families who are struggling,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to her caucus Sunday, calling the bill ""an important initial step.""

I don't know whether I would go so far as ""crush the virus"" — that ship seems to have sailed a long time ago, without the kind of direct payments this deal comes nowhere close to providing. But framing it as an ""initial step"" is important messaging, one the Democrats clearly hope tamps down on some of the disappointment.

President-elect Joe Biden is expected to push for another package in the new Congress come January. Accordingly, Democrats have started reminding voters just what the deal could have looked like if they'd only had control of the Senate. Cue the reminders that Georgia's twin Senate runoff elections are in less than a month.

If Democrats controlled the Senate:



- the cash payments would be $1200 not $600

- there would be $175 billion, not $25 billion, to help people pay the rent

- there would be flexible money for states and cities and bonus checks for frontline workers

2020-12-22 15:46:03+00:00,13,"One tray of Covid-19 vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer contains 975 doses — way too many for a rural hospital in Arkansas.

But with the logistical gymnastics required to safely get the Pfizer vaccine to rural health care workers, splitting the trays into smaller shipments has its own dangers. Once out of the freezer that keeps it at 94 degrees below zero, the vaccine lasts only five days and must be refrigerated in transit.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In Arkansas — where over 40 percent of its counties are rural and Covid-19 infections are climbing — solving this distribution puzzle is urgently critical, said Dr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state’s epidemiologist.

“If their providers come down with Covid-19,” Dillaha said, “there’s no one there to take care of the patients.”

Such quandaries resonate with officials in Georgia, Kentucky, Utah, Indiana, Wisconsin and Colorado. The first push of the nation’s mass Covid-19 vaccination effort has been chaotic, marked by a lack of guidance and miscommunication from the federal level.

With Washington punting most vaccination decisions, each state and county is left to weigh where to send vaccines first and which of two vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use makes the most sense for each nursing home, hospital, local health department and even school. And after state officials warned for months they lacked the resources to distribute vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is only now set to receive a major bump in funding — $8.75 billion in Congress’ latest relief bill, which lawmakers are likely to pass this week.

The feat facing public health officials has “absolutely no comparison” in recent history, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.

Officials who thought the H1N1 swine flu shot in 2009 was a logistical nightmare say it now looks simple in comparison. “It was a flu vaccine. It was one dose. It came at refrigerator-stable temperatures,” Hannan said. “It was nothing like this.”

Within just a few days, the logistical barriers of the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech were laid bare. Many officials now hang their hopes on Moderna, whose vaccine comes in containers of 100 doses, doesn’t require deep freezing and is good for 30 days from the time it’s shipped.

The federal government had divvied up nearly 8 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines to distribute this week, on top of roughly 3 million Pfizer shots that were sent last week, said Army Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed effort.

Perna said he took “personal responsibility” for overstating how many Pfizer doses states would receive.

Federal delays have led to confusion, Dillaha said: “Sometimes we don’t have information from CDC or Operation Warp Speed until right before a decision needs to be made.”

Officials in other states painted a mixed picture of the rollout.

Georgia’s Coastal Health District, which oversees public health for eight counties and has offices in Savannah and Brunswick, spent more than $27,000 on two ultra-cold freezers for the Pfizer vaccine, which it’s treating “like gold,” said Dr. Lawton Davis, its health director. Health care workers are being asked to travel, some up to 40 minutes, to get their vaccinations, because shipping them would risk wasting doses, he said. Vaccination uptake has been lower than Davis would like to see. “It’s sort of a jigsaw puzzle and balancing act,” he said. “We’re kind of learning as we go.”

In Utah, sites to vaccinate teachers and first responders starting in January had no capability to store the Pfizer vaccine, although officials are trying to secure some ultra-cold storage, a state department of health spokesperson said. Very few of Kentucky’s local health offices could store the Pfizer shots, because of refrigeration requirements and the size of shipments, said Sara Jo Best, public health director of the Lincoln Trail District. Indiana’s state health department had to identify alternative cold storage options for 17 hospitals following changes in guidance for the vaccine thermal shippers.

And in New Hampshire, where the National Guard will help administer vaccines, officials last week were still finalizing details for 13 community-based sites where first responders and health care workers are due to get vaccinated later this month. Jake Leon, a state Health and Human Services spokesperson, said that while the sites will be able to administer both companies’ vaccines, most likely they’ll get Moderna’s because of its easier transport. Even as the earliest vaccines are injected, much remains up in the air.

“It’s day to day and even then hour by hour or minute by minute — what we know and how we plan for it,” Leon said Friday. “We’re building the plane while flying it.”

In all, the Trump administration has bought 900 million Covid-19 vaccine doses from six companies, but most of the vaccines are still in clinical studies. Even the front-runners whose shots have received FDA emergency authorization — Pfizer and BioNTech on Dec. 11, Moderna on Dec. 18 — will require months to manufacture at that scale. The Trump administration plans to distribute 20 million vaccine doses to states by early January, Perna said Saturday.

By spring, officials hope to stage broader vaccine deployment beyond top-priority populations of health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, as well as first responders.

During the effort to vaccinate Americans against H1N1, Dillaha said, health departments set up mass vaccination clinics in their counties and delivered doses to schools. But hospitals are taking charge of parts of the initial Covid-19 immunization campaign, both because health care workers are at highest risk of illness or death from Covid-19, and to pick up the slack from health departments overwhelmed by case investigations and contact tracing from an unending stream of new infections.

Best said her workforce is struggling to keep up with Covid-19 infections alone, much less flu season and upcoming Covid-19 vaccinations. Public health department personnel in Kentucky shrank by 49 percent from 2009 to 2019, according to state data she supplied. Across the country, 38,000 state and local health positions have disappeared since the 2008 recession. Per capita spending for local health departments has dropped by 18 percent since 2010.

Nationally, Pfizer and Moderna have signed contracts with the federal government to each provide 100 million vaccine doses by the end of March; Moderna is set to deliver a second tranche of 100 million doses by June. States were playing it safe last week, directing Pfizer vials mainly to facilities with ultra-cold freezers, Hannan said.

“A lot of that vaccine is destined for institutional facilities,” Sean Dickson, director of health policy for West Health Policy Center, said of the Pfizer shots. The center, with the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, found that 35 percent of counties have two or fewer facilities to administer Covid-19 vaccines.

The analysis found tremendous variation in how far people would need to drive for the vaccine. Residents of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas face the longest drives, with more than 10 percent living more than 10 miles from the closest facility that could administer a shot.

Counties with long driving distances between sites and a low number of sites overall “are going to be the hardest ones to reach,” said Inmaculada Hernandez, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and lead author of the analysis.

Certain vaccines could be better suited for such places, including Johnson & Johnson’s potential offering, which is a single shot, and health departments could distribute in rural areas through mobile units, she said. The company is expected to apply for FDA emergency authorization in February, Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Moncef Slaoui said this month.

Until then, Pfizer and Moderna are the companies supplying doses for the country, and they’re not considered equal even though each is more than 90 percent effective at reducing disease.

In Wisconsin, the Moderna vaccine “gives us many more options” and “allows for us to get doses to those smaller clinics, more-rural clinics, in a way that reduces the number of logistics” needed for ultra-cold storage, Dr. Stephanie Schauer, the state’s immunization program manager, told reporters Wednesday.

Alan Morgan, head of the National Rural Health Association, echoed that the Moderna vaccine is being looked to as a “rural solution.” But he said states including Kansas have shown that a Pfizer rural rollout can be done.

“It’s where these states put a priority — either they prioritize rural or they don’t,” he said. “It’s a cautionary tale of what we may see this spring, of rural populations perhaps being second-tier when it comes to vaccination.”

Virginia, too, has a plan for getting the Pfizer vaccine to far-flung places. It’s shipping the vaccines to 18 health facilities with ultra-cold freezers across the state. The hubs are distributed widely enough so vaccinators can bring shots from there to health workers even in thinly populated areas before they spoil, said Brookie Crawford, spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health’s central region.

Washington, on the other hand, allows hospitals without ultra-cold freezers to temporarily store Pfizer vaccines in the thermal boxes they arrive in, said Franji Mayes, spokesperson for the state’s health department. That means a box needs to be used quickly, before doses expire.

“We are also working on a policy that will allow hospitals who don’t expect to vaccinate 975 people to transfer extra vaccine to other enrolled facilities,” she said. “This will reduce wasted vaccine.”

The United States on Tuesday saw more Covid-19 deaths than ever before, a grim milestone in a month that has seen records set and then surpassed.

Across the country, 3,350 Covid-19 deaths were reported, according to NBC News' tally. The previous highest number of deaths reported in a single day was Dec. 16.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized a massive Covid-19 relief package that had just been passed by Congress.

Trump said in a video that he wanted the bill to be amended to increase the $600 direct payment to $2,000, as well as other changes. Trump didn't explicitly say he would veto it, but his remarks suggested that he might.",MSNBC,"['bill', 'veto', 'relief', 'covid19', 'deaths', 'coronavirus', 'dec', 'wanted', 'tally', 'video', 'congress', 'passes', 'deal', 'reported', 'criticizes', 'trump', 'united']",0
2020-12-22 14:38:07+00:00,36,"I suppose we should be grateful. Congress has finally reached a deal on a new round of coronavirus relief funding, nine months after the first package was signed into law and five months since the bulk of that funding ran out.

With this deal, an estimated 12 million Americans would avoid seeing their weekly incomes hit $0 as their unemployment benefits expired. Eviction protections would be renewed, keeping families from being taken to court and thrown into the streets soon after the holidays. And households that use SNAP benefits, aka food stamps, would get more loaded monthly onto their EBT cards until June.

This is all great news. Provisions in this bill are desperately needed to help bridge the gap until Covid-19 vaccines can be more widely distributed. But if that's the case ... why does this bill still feel like such a disappointment?

It may just be the holidays talking, but the watered-down, belated efforts in this new package feel like when you're a kid on Christmas morning, after you spent ages curating your wish list. You'd been diligent and thoughtful after combing through catalogs, ranking your preferences, denoting the prices for your pare — er, Santa, even keeping the price cap low so nothing felt too extravagant.

Now, as you open the presents under the tree, you see some pretty decent gifts, ones that you'll enjoy and appreciate. But the things from your actual list are smaller than you'd intended, in the right spirit but the wrong item — a pogo stick instead of Moon Shoes or a Lego X-Wing when the Millennium Falcon was at the top of your list — or they're missing altogether. Determined not to be a brat, you put on a brave face and smile, but the disappointment still stings.

We shouldn't pretend that $600 is a true lifeline, though, for people who have been unemployed for months or are working reduced hours

""You should be grateful that you got any presents at all"" — that's the lesson that we tend to teach letdown kids at Christmas, especially when times are hard. It's a very American moral, one that urges children not to be greedy, to be appreciative of the good in their lives and the spirit of the season. The analogy breaks down when you consider that times are not hard for everyone equally. And after months of delays, the people who need the most are getting less than before for entirely arbitrary reasons.

Consider unemployment benefits: People laid off in the pandemic would get a federal boost in their state unemployment checks after funding for the expansion ran out in July. People who are self-employed, work as freelancers or were mired in the gig economy, as well as those whose state benefits are running out, would still be able to draw checks, as well, rather than see the authorization for those programs expire at the end of the year. However, assistance for both groups would be slashed in half, to $300 extra a week. That's money that would keep some people from drowning entirely — but still leave many thrashing and straining.

Another round of individual checks would be going out, one of the last items agreed to in the negotiations, but these would be halved, too. The checks that would go out to Americans making $75,000 or less would be a relief for many. We shouldn't pretend that $600 is a true lifeline, though, for people who have been unemployed for months or are working reduced hours as the restaurant or the retail store where they work teetered on the edge of failure.

Compare that to European countries, most of which have subsidized workers' salaries rather than let people lose their jobs, as The Washington Post explained in October:

The basic model of the European programs, sometimes called short-time work, is that struggling employers can place their workers on either full or partial furloughs, while the government takes over most of the cost of their idled time. The aims are to keep paychecks flowing to anxious citizens, prevent otherwise sound businesses from going under, and avoid the need to hire and train new workers after a crisis recedes.

Democrats, who for months pushed back against Republican measures that they felt would unfairly benefit businesses at the expense of workers, are spinning this deal as both a major win and just the first of several major packages.

""We have now reached agreement on a bill that will crush the virus and put money in the pockets of working families who are struggling,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to her caucus Sunday, calling the bill ""an important initial step.""

I don't know whether I would go so far as ""crush the virus"" — that ship seems to have sailed a long time ago, without the kind of direct payments this deal comes nowhere close to providing. But framing it as an ""initial step"" is important messaging, one the Democrats clearly hope tamps down on some of the disappointment.

President-elect Joe Biden is expected to push for another package in the new Congress come January. Accordingly, Democrats have started reminding voters just what the deal could have looked like if they'd only had control of the Senate. Cue the reminders that Georgia's twin Senate runoff elections are in less than a month.

If Democrats controlled the Senate:



- the cash payments would be $1200 not $600

- there would be $175 billion, not $25 billion, to help people pay the rent

2020-12-22 04:48:02+00:00,47,"In surprising comments, President Donald Trump shredded a just-passed Covid-19 relief package Tuesday night, saying the legislation includes measures that have nothing to do with the pandemic and that it is too stingy with payments to average Americans.

""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 (direct payment) to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple,"" Trump said in a video posted to Twitter of him speaking from the White House.

""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package,"" said, adding, ""And maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done.""

Before Trump spoke, all signs and expectations had been that he intended to sign the relief bill as soon as it lands on his desk, possibly later this week. White House aides, in fact, said as much.

While Trump didn't explicitly say he would veto the legislation, his remarks suggested that he might. If he does, lawmakers might be able to override his veto, but if he simply refuses to sign it, the bill might die.

House Democrats, who had advocated higher direct checks only to encounter Republican resistance in the Senate, immediately said they welcomed Trump's support for sending out more money. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland tweeted that Democrats would try Thursday to pass a separate bill that would send out $2,000 direct payments. Because many members of the House are out of town, Hoyer said, leaders will try to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but that means any single member can kill it. The fate of such a bill is unclear in the Senate.

The legislation already passed by Congress included two bills that were combined: One was the Covid-19 relief and stimulus bill, and the other was a large spending bill to fund the government through next September. If the spending bill is not enacted into law, the government will have to shut down Monday.

In the four-minute video, Trump trashed the legislation for including, among other things, what he said was ""$85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia; $134 million to Burma; $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment; $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan; $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Forty million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which is not even open for business, $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art.""

All of those items were in the spending bill, not the Covid-19 bill, which Trump seemed to be conflating.

""This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending,"" Trump added.

Congress can't amend the bill now that it has been passed, and it would have to consider new legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats had fought to boost the direct payments to Americans in the face of GOP opposition.

We spent months trying to secure $2000 checks but Republicans blocked it



Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need



Maybe Trump can finally make himself useful and get Republicans not to block it again — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) December 23, 2020

The nearly $900 billion package, passed with bipartisan support, includes a new round of stimulus checks, an extension of unemployment benefits and more money for vaccines and education.

The legislation easily passed in the House — 359 to 53 — before it breezed through the Senate shortly before midnight Monday in a 92-6 vote.

The agreement includes stimulus checks of up to $600 per person for individuals earning $75,000 per year and married couples who earn up to $150,000, with $600 more for each dependent under 18 living in the same household.

It would also extend unemployment insurance and federal unemployment insurance — $300 a week — and provide over $284 billion more in loans for businesses struggling to pay rent and workers, $69 billion for testing and vaccine distribution and $82 billion for colleges and schools.

Because of the size of the 5,600-page bill and because government funding runs out at midnight, lawmakers attached a separate measure to avoid a government shutdown for seven days.

The Senate Historical Office said it appears to be the longest bill ever approved by Congress, The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers complained that they didn't have time to read through the legislation before the votes.

The direct payments would be smaller than the $1,200 checks people received when Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, called the CARES Act, in March to soften the early economic blow of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The enhanced unemployment benefits are also less than the $600 a week provided in that bill, which was the largest economic relief package in modern U.S. history.

Earlier, before Trump's attack on the measure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Americans would begin getting direct payments by ""the beginning of next week.""

Lawmakers had been at loggerheads over a second relief package for months as Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to rise during the holiday season, and many Americans and small-business owners are in dire financial straits. A recent study by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, for example, found that if direct unemployment aid was not extended, 5 million more people would enter poverty in January.

The parties worked out a deal that includes many of their top priorities. For Democrats, those included an extension of the moratorium on evictions and targeted funding for underrepresented groups, such as Native American and other minority communities. House Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to limits on benefits for undocumented immigrants and food stamp payments as wins.

The legislation does not include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare or relief for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic. Republicans pushed for liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers, but that was also left out.

Schumer criticized Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Monday, saying more aid is needed.

""This bill cannot and will not be the final word upon congressional relief from the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""This is an emergency survival package, and when we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left by the bill and get the economy moving with strong federal input.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'payments', 'passed', 'blasts', 'relief', 'legislation', 'billion', 'package', 'unemployment', 'congress', 'direct', 'million', 'changes', 'demands', 'trump', 'covid']",0

We’re nearing the end of a movie whose driving narrative has been “get a vaccine!” The trials were successful, the FDA issued emergency use authorization, the world rejoiced, the first doses were administered in a flurry of joy — and then the credits rolled. Presumably, life goes back to normal. But when, and how?

Placing faith in an organized, efficient, timely distribution of the vaccine doesn’t just feel like folly. It feels psychologically reckless.

We’ve got not just one, but two viable vaccines (with a third reportedly pending). But like everything else related to the government’s handling of Covid-19, the plans for the vaccine’s distribution are opaque, piecemeal and largely delegated to the discretion of individual states. After the initial distribution to front-line health care workers, the next few months are poised to be a “veritable land rush for Covid shots” as various industries and employers lobby for their employees to be next in line.

You can use a tool like this one to try to figure out where you are in the prioritized list, but it’s all relative. If you live in my hometown of Lewiston, Idaho, and are over 65, there is a lot that depends on whether your health conditions qualify you as “high risk.” And then there’s all the mitigating factors: Will there be adequate refrigeration? How will we reach the population that isn’t already calling their doctors, eager to be first in line? Is there even a plan, let alone the sort of detailed, dynamic plan that a massive distribution requires? What about the equally important distribution of the second dose? As the writer Zeynep Tufekci recently put it, will the U.S. “snatch defeat from the jaws of vaccine victory?”

“Few people across the country have a clear idea of how exactly the Covid-19 vaccine supply chains will be organized,” Bruce Y. Lee, who has worked in vaccine distribution for over 15 years, recently wrote in StatNews. “Vaccine chains have historically been neglected and underappreciated.”

When I try to fast-forward the tape of this pandemic, I can’t make the scenes of the future into anything coherent.

Yes, a new administration will be in charge at the federal level. It’s comforting, even thrilling, that they believe in science — and have a comparatively detailed plan for how to combat the pandemic moving forward. But like so many other Americans, my faith in our government’s ability to successfully execute any plan in relation to the pandemic isn’t just compromised. It’s gone.

On the federal, state and local level, we’ve bungled testing and messaging. We’ve repeatedly privileged businesses over human life. Congress has failed to pass substantive, lasting relief for the millions of families who are suffering, experiencing food insecurity, or facing eviction. It’s taken months for people to access unemployment benefits through an understaffed, labyrinthian system.

Just recently, the public learned that the U.S. government had previously refused the option of purchasing an additional 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, raising questions of a potential “vaccine cliff” in which millions would wait — perhaps for months — for supply to catch up.

But to those with power, money and influence, rules can always be bent. California’s stern messaging about serving the neediest first hasn’t stopped the rich from trying to leap ahead of teachers, farmworkers and firefighters.

Dr. Jeff Toll, who has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the first hospitals to stock the vaccine, recalled a patient asking: “If I donate $25,000 to Cedars, would that help me get in line?’” Toll said no.

I know the pandemic will end. But I’m also mentally exhausted.

I believe in the vaccine. I will absolutely take it the second it’s available to me. I know the pandemic will end. But I’m also mentally exhausted. I have no room for dashed hopes, no tolerance for even more changed plans, other than my current plan, which is “have no plans.” Placing faith in an organized, efficient, timely distribution of the vaccine doesn’t just feel like folly. It feels psychologically reckless.

I’d love to speak cheerfully to my mom, who hasn’t been in a public space since March, about the future. I want to tell my friends who’ve been trying to juggle working from home with kids that relief was coming their way — or tell other friends that their restaurant jobs would be coming back soon. I wish I could feel even slightly confident that the trail race that just announced plans to be in-person in July would come to pass.

But more than 3,000 Americans are dying every day, in part because we still cannot agree, as a society, to adhere to guidelines as simple as wearing a mask or limiting the number of people in social gatherings. When protesters gather outside the homes of health officials in Boise to protest a mask mandate, even as the state’s hospitals face the prospect of rationing care, what cause do I have for hope or trust?

As the vaccination rolls out, we’ll have new guidelines to follow, new best practices to observe. But faith in the CDC and local health officials has been dangerously eroded. What stats should we follow, and where should we find them? Even epidemiologists have pretty wildly disparate ideas about risk, or when things will go back to normal, or what “normal” will even look like. And we’re only just beginning to grapple with the profound physical and psychological aftereffects of this pandemic.

Which helps explain why, when I try to fast-forward the tape of this pandemic, I can’t make the scenes of the future into anything coherent: Will we be wearing masks in public spaces for the foreseeable future? When’s the first time I’ll get on a plane? Eat dinner at a restaurant? When will I be able to forgive the people in my community who’ve behaved so recklessly, so selfishly, for so long? How will we reckon with our collective grief over more than 300,000 dead?

Our brains do their best to keep us going, day after day, week after week, through grave disappointment, trauma and failure. Right now, they’re trying to keep us going just a few months more. And the best way to keep us safe, at least in this moment, is to keep the future as blurry — but still bright — as possible.",MSNBC,"['world', 'postcovid19', 'relief', 'plans', 'prepare', 'health', 'feel', 'distribution', 'plan', 'pandemic', 'future', 'vaccine', 'week']",0

I’d love to speak cheerfully to my mom, who hasn’t been in a public space since March, about the future. I want to tell my friends who’ve been trying to juggle working from home with kids that relief was coming their way — or tell other friends that their restaurant jobs would be coming back soon. I wish I could feel even slightly confident that the trail race that just announced plans to be in-person in July would come to pass.

But more than 3,000 Americans are dying every day, in part because we still cannot agree, as a society, to adhere to guidelines as simple as wearing a mask or limiting the number of people in social gatherings. When protesters gather outside the homes of health officials in Boise to protest a mask mandate, even as the state’s hospitals face the prospect of rationing care, what cause do I have for hope or trust?

As the vaccination rolls out, we’ll have new guidelines to follow, new best practices to observe. But faith in the CDC and local health officials has been dangerously eroded. What stats should we follow, and where should we find them? Even epidemiologists have pretty wildly disparate ideas about risk, or when things will go back to normal, or what “normal” will even look like. And we’re only just beginning to grapple with the profound physical and psychological aftereffects of this pandemic.

Which helps explain why, when I try to fast-forward the tape of this pandemic, I can’t make the scenes of the future into anything coherent: Will we be wearing masks in public spaces for the foreseeable future? When’s the first time I’ll get on a plane? Eat dinner at a restaurant? When will I be able to forgive the people in my community who’ve behaved so recklessly, so selfishly, for so long? How will we reckon with our collective grief over more than 300,000 dead?

Our brains do their best to keep us going, day after day, week after week, through grave disappointment, trauma and failure. Right now, they’re trying to keep us going just a few months more. And the best way to keep us safe, at least in this moment, is to keep the future as blurry — but still bright — as possible.",MSNBC,"['world', 'postcovid19', 'relief', 'plans', 'prepare', 'health', 'feel', 'distribution', 'plan', 'pandemic', 'future', 'vaccine', 'week']",0
2020-12-22 02:20:57+00:00,42,"In surprising comments, President Donald Trump shredded a just-passed Covid-19 relief package Tuesday night, saying the legislation includes measures that have nothing to do with the pandemic and that it is too stingy with payments to average Americans.

""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 (direct payment) to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple,"" Trump said in a video posted to Twitter of him speaking from the White House.

""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package,"" said, adding, ""And maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done.""

Before Trump spoke, all signs and expectations had been that he intended to sign the relief bill as soon as it lands on his desk, possibly later this week. White House aides, in fact, said as much.

While Trump didn't explicitly say he would veto the legislation, his remarks suggested that he might. If he does, lawmakers might be able to override his veto, but if he simply refuses to sign it, the bill might die.

House Democrats, who had advocated higher direct checks only to encounter Republican resistance in the Senate, immediately said they welcomed Trump's support for sending out more money. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland tweeted that Democrats would try Thursday to pass a separate bill that would send out $2,000 direct payments. Because many members of the House are out of town, Hoyer said, leaders will try to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but that means any single member can kill it. The fate of such a bill is unclear in the Senate.

The legislation already passed by Congress included two bills that were combined: One was the Covid-19 relief and stimulus bill, and the other was a large spending bill to fund the government through next September. If the spending bill is not enacted into law, the government will have to shut down Monday.

In the four-minute video, Trump trashed the legislation for including, among other things, what he said was ""$85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia; $134 million to Burma; $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment; $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan; $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Forty million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which is not even open for business, $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art.""

All of those items were in the spending bill, not the Covid-19 bill, which Trump seemed to be conflating.

""This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending,"" Trump added.

Congress can't amend the bill now that it has been passed, and it would have to consider new legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats had fought to boost the direct payments to Americans in the face of GOP opposition.

We spent months trying to secure $2000 checks but Republicans blocked it



Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need



Maybe Trump can finally make himself useful and get Republicans not to block it again — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) December 23, 2020

The nearly $900 billion package, passed with bipartisan support, includes a new round of stimulus checks, an extension of unemployment benefits and more money for vaccines and education.

The legislation easily passed in the House — 359 to 53 — before it breezed through the Senate shortly before midnight Monday in a 92-6 vote.

The agreement includes stimulus checks of up to $600 per person for individuals earning $75,000 per year and married couples who earn up to $150,000, with $600 more for each dependent under 18 living in the same household.

It would also extend unemployment insurance and federal unemployment insurance — $300 a week — and provide over $284 billion more in loans for businesses struggling to pay rent and workers, $69 billion for testing and vaccine distribution and $82 billion for colleges and schools.

Because of the size of the 5,600-page bill and because government funding runs out at midnight, lawmakers attached a separate measure to avoid a government shutdown for seven days.

The Senate Historical Office said it appears to be the longest bill ever approved by Congress, The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers complained that they didn't have time to read through the legislation before the votes.

The direct payments would be smaller than the $1,200 checks people received when Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, called the CARES Act, in March to soften the early economic blow of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The enhanced unemployment benefits are also less than the $600 a week provided in that bill, which was the largest economic relief package in modern U.S. history.

Earlier, before Trump's attack on the measure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Americans would begin getting direct payments by ""the beginning of next week.""

Lawmakers had been at loggerheads over a second relief package for months as Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to rise during the holiday season, and many Americans and small-business owners are in dire financial straits. A recent study by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, for example, found that if direct unemployment aid was not extended, 5 million more people would enter poverty in January.

The parties worked out a deal that includes many of their top priorities. For Democrats, those included an extension of the moratorium on evictions and targeted funding for underrepresented groups, such as Native American and other minority communities. House Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to limits on benefits for undocumented immigrants and food stamp payments as wins.

The legislation does not include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare or relief for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic. Republicans pushed for liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers, but that was also left out.

Schumer criticized Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Monday, saying more aid is needed.

""This bill cannot and will not be the final word upon congressional relief from the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""This is an emergency survival package, and when we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left by the bill and get the economy moving with strong federal input.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'payments', 'passed', 'blasts', 'relief', 'legislation', 'billion', 'package', 'unemployment', 'congress', 'direct', 'million', 'changes', 'demands', 'trump', 'covid']",0
2020-12-22 01:55:03+00:00,19,"Like everyone else, I’ve spent the past few weeks mesmerized by images of health care workers receiving the first doses of the vaccine. I’ve rejoiced at social media posts announcing a sibling, a partner or a best friend who’s first in line. “My sister, who’s been treating Covid patients this year and is spending the holidays alone to keep the rest of us safe, just told our fam group chat she’s getting the vaccine this week,” journalist Connie Wang tweeted. “The collective relief and joy we feel is inexplicable.”

We’re nearing the end of a movie whose driving narrative has been “get a vaccine!” The trials were successful, the FDA issued emergency use authorization, the world rejoiced, the first doses were administered in a flurry of joy — and then the credits rolled. Presumably, life goes back to normal. But when, and how?

Placing faith in an organized, efficient, timely distribution of the vaccine doesn’t just feel like folly. It feels psychologically reckless.

We’ve got not just one, but two viable vaccines (with a third reportedly pending). But like everything else related to the government’s handling of Covid-19, the plans for the vaccine’s distribution are opaque, piecemeal and largely delegated to the discretion of individual states. After the initial distribution to front-line health care workers, the next few months are poised to be a “veritable land rush for Covid shots” as various industries and employers lobby for their employees to be next in line.

You can use a tool like this one to try to figure out where you are in the prioritized list, but it’s all relative. If you live in my hometown of Lewiston, Idaho, and are over 65, there is a lot that depends on whether your health conditions qualify you as “high risk.” And then there’s all the mitigating factors: Will there be adequate refrigeration? How will we reach the population that isn’t already calling their doctors, eager to be first in line? Is there even a plan, let alone the sort of detailed, dynamic plan that a massive distribution requires? What about the equally important distribution of the second dose? As the writer Zeynep Tufekci recently put it, will the U.S. “snatch defeat from the jaws of vaccine victory?”

“Few people across the country have a clear idea of how exactly the Covid-19 vaccine supply chains will be organized,” Bruce Y. Lee, who has worked in vaccine distribution for over 15 years, recently wrote in StatNews. “Vaccine chains have historically been neglected and underappreciated.”

When I try to fast-forward the tape of this pandemic, I can’t make the scenes of the future into anything coherent.

Yes, a new administration will be in charge at the federal level. It’s comforting, even thrilling, that they believe in science — and have a comparatively detailed plan for how to combat the pandemic moving forward. But like so many other Americans, my faith in our government’s ability to successfully execute any plan in relation to the pandemic isn’t just compromised. It’s gone.

On the federal, state and local level, we’ve bungled testing and messaging. We’ve repeatedly privileged businesses over human life. Congress has failed to pass substantive, lasting relief for the millions of families who are suffering, experiencing food insecurity, or facing eviction. It’s taken months for people to access unemployment benefits through an understaffed, labyrinthian system.

Just recently, the public learned that the U.S. government had previously refused the option of purchasing an additional 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, raising questions of a potential “vaccine cliff” in which millions would wait — perhaps for months — for supply to catch up.

But to those with power, money and influence, rules can always be bent. California’s stern messaging about serving the neediest first hasn’t stopped the rich from trying to leap ahead of teachers, farmworkers and firefighters.

Dr. Jeff Toll, who has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the first hospitals to stock the vaccine, recalled a patient asking: “If I donate $25,000 to Cedars, would that help me get in line?’” Toll said no.

I know the pandemic will end. But I’m also mentally exhausted.

2020-12-21 19:44:03+00:00,24,"Late last month, Donald Trump left no doubt that he wanted credit for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. ""I came up with vaccines that people didn't think we'd have for five years,"" the president declared in a Nov. 29 Fox News interview. A few days earlier, during a Thanksgiving message to U.S. troops, the Republican added, ""Don't let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines.""

Pro-Trump voices have been pushing similar lines. Kayleigh McEnany, for example, recently called the vaccine ""the Trump vaccine,"" while Marc Thiessen, closely aligned with the Republican White House, recently devoted a column to the idea that Biden should celebrate Trump as the hero of vaccine development as a way to ""unite"" the country.

As a substantive matter, the entire pitch is a stretch. While it's true the outgoing administration took steps to expedite the vaccine process, it's also true that any administration would've had the common sense to do the same thing. What's more, while scientists were working diligently on a breakthrough, Trump spent months downplaying the crisis, telling the public not to fear the pandemic, and undermining public-health mitigation efforts.

Nevertheless, now that needless are reaching shoulders, it's tempting to think the outgoing president, desperate for credit, would be eager to claim the vaccine spotlight for himself. As the Associated Press reported over the weekend, that's largely the opposite of what's actually happening, with Trump preferring to be ""conspicuously absent"" as the largest vaccination campaign in the nation's history gets underway.

Trump, who was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October, has been largely absent from the effort to sell the American public on what aides hope will be a key part of his legacy. He has held no public events to trumpet the rollout. He hasn't said when he will be inoculated. And he has tweeted fewer than a handful of times about the vaccines despite sending a flurry of tweets about other topics.

The AP's report added that White House aides have pushed the outgoing president to be the public face of the vaccination campaign -- visiting labs, staging photo-ops at production facilities, thanking workers at clinics, etc. -- but Trump has ""pushed aside"" such plans.

The New York Times published a related report over the weekend, marveling at the outgoing president's passivity and willingness to play the role of ""bystander.""

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told the newspaper that Trump's post-election fury was blinding him to an opportunity to boost his legacy. ""The president could have made that the hallmark of his last days in office,"" Romney said. ""Instead, he's seen as promoting conspiracy theories and evidence-free accusations of fraud.""

Trump is putting his priorities on display. Sure, he could be thanking clinicians and applauding vaccine deliveries, but the outgoing president apparently sees the vaccination campaign as a distraction from what he considers really important: his defeat, his conspiracy theories, his preoccupation with a baseless sense of grievance.

Given a choice between obsessing over election fraud that didn't happen and positioning himself for credit on the COVID-19 vaccine, Trump doesn't see an especially tough call. The latter would make sense, but his misguided instincts gear him toward the former.

The president himself acknowledged during a recent campaign rally in Georgia, in reference to his anti-election efforts, ""I've probably worked harder in the last three weeks than I ever have in my life. Doing this.""

I continue to believe this was a more extraordinary confession than he realized. By Trump's own telling, he's willing to invest more effort into claiming power through illegitimate means than anything else -- including keeping Americans safe during a deadly pandemic.",MSNBC,"['credit', 'president', 'role', 'bystander', 'breakthrough', 'sense', 'campaign', 'vaccines', 'outgoing', 'vaccination', 'vaccine', 'public', 'trump', 'covid', 'prefers']",0

""I’m sure all Americans are excited to see me, the guy who let Covid spread everywhere, get one of the first vaccines,"" said Pence, played by Beck Bennett.

The vice president, who chairs the White House's coronavirus task force, sought to reassure Americans who have doubts about the safety of the vaccine.

""I just want reassure the American people that this vaccine is completely safe and harmless,"" he said. ""That’s why President Trump refuses to talk about it.""

Pence apologized for the president. ""He may not be doing president anymore, but he still cares deeply about not going to prison,"" he said.

Pence said the vaccination, meanwhile, was painless.

""For the past four years,"" he said, ""I haven't felt a thing—just kind of watched the country burn.""

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris joined the fray, and Pence asked her, ""How did you get into the White House.""

""I won more votes,"" she said.

President-elect Joe Biden (Alex Moffatt) joined the others and proclaimed that change was coming.

""You're about to have a real leader again,"" he said. ""And you're about to have the most diverse Cabinet in the history of American politics.""

Harris quickly provided some fine print: ""I will make sure that Joe never specifies what he means by diverse,"" she said. ""That's my Christmas present to you, America.""

The incident took place during an Orlando-to-Los-Angeles flight on Monday. The flight diverted to New Orleans when a man became ill on the plane. Paramedics transported the male passenger to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to United Airlines.

""Everything felt so intense and not real,"" Shay Allen, a passenger on the flight, told NBC Los Angeles. Allen said she saw the man board the plane with his head down and breathing heavily. Less than 20 minutes into the flight, a nurse and an emergency medical technician began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him, according to Allen. She and other passengers indicated they overheard the man's wife say he had been experiencing Covid-like symptoms.

“At the time of the diversion, we were informed he had suffered a cardiac arrest, so passengers were given the option to take a later flight or continue on with their travel plans,” the airline said. ""Now that the CDC has contacted us directly, we are sharing requested information with the agency so they can work with local health officials to conduct outreach to any customer the CDC believes may be at risk for possible exposure or infection.""

The male passenger had filled out a required checklist before boarding the flight, saying he had not tested positive for Covid and did not have symptoms. But it's apparent that he ""wrongly acknowledged this requirement,” the airline said.

The CDC said in a statement that they are in the ""process of collecting information and proceeding according to our standard operating procedures to determine if further public health action is appropriate."" The agency is not providing any information about the deceased passenger ""to protect the privacy of the individual.""

Allen said she has been quarantining at home in California as required by the state. By Friday, she had not been contacted by health officials, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Four flight attendants who worked on the flight have also gone into quarantine for 14 days after the plane landed in Los Angeles, Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for Association of Flight Attendants, told NBC Los Angeles.

“Our union continues to provide support to the crew,” Garland said. “We urge passengers to comply with airline COVID policies and stay home if you’re sick.”",MSNBC,"['possible', 'nbc', 'warns', 'los', 'health', 'airlines', 'officials', 'death', 'covidrelated', 'airline', 'flight', 'exposure', 'cdc', 'plane', 'passengers', 'united', 'passenger']",0
2020-12-21 06:33:07+00:00,25,"WASHINGTON — After months of stalemate, Congress struck a deal on nearly $900 billion in Covid-19 relief, including a new round of direct payments and help for jobless Americans, families and businesses struggling in the pandemic.

""More help is on the way,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday evening on the Senate floor. ""Moments ago, in consultation with our committees, the four leaders of the Senate and the House finalized an agreement.""

The agreement includes stimulus checks of up to $600 per person for individuals earning $75,000 per year and $600 for their children – the same requirements as the first round of stimulus checks.

It provides relief for the jobless, including an extension of unemployment insurance and a federal unemployment insurance bonus of $300 per week, over $284 billion more in loans for businesses struggling to pay rent and workers, $69 billion in testing and vaccine distribution funds and $82 billion in funding for colleges and schools.

It also includes the Democrats' priority of $25 billion in rental assistance and a one-month extension of the eviction moratorium. More than $13 billion in food assistance is also in the bill.

The package excludes the Republican priority of liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers. It also doesn't include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare and for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic.

Lawmakers are expected to vote on the package beginning Monday.

The measure is characterized as an emergency bridge through the first quarter of 2021. President-elect Joe Biden and leaders of both parties have said they intend to revisit Covid-19 relief in the new year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called it a “first step.”

Negotiations bled into the weekend, forcing members to extend a government funding extension to provide time to allow pass both the COVID relief measure and a $1.4 trillion government funding bill for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2021.

As Sunday came to a close, it became clear that lawmakers wouldn't be able to pass the sweeping legislation before funding was set to expire midnight. Congress later Sunday then passed a one-day stopgap bill to give both chambers enough time to work through the legislation.

Biden applauded the deal in a statement on Sunday, saying he was ""heartened"" by its bipartisan support. He also pledged that his administration would immediately ""undertake additional steps to get the virus under control and build our economy back better than it was before this crisis"" once he takes office next month.

Months of fits and starts of unsuccessful talks have led to lapses in provisions of the CARES Act, including the $600-a-week federal unemployment bonus, aggravating the suffering of millions of Americans who have struggled to make ends meet.

The agreement had been expected early last week, but it hit a roadblock after some Republicans, led by Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, demanded an end to Federal Reserve authority over emergency lending. Democrats pushed back, accusing the GOP of seeking to sabotage the economy under Biden. Senior lawmakers reached a compromise on the issue late Saturday.

The parties had long been at odds over price tag and policy, but negotiations were kick-started in recent weeks by a bipartisan group of moderate senators and House members, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, which quietly began informal discussions to negotiate a viable framework.

Their talks resulted in an agreement on a $748 billion proposal that became the basis of negotiations among McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as well as the Trump administration.

“With hundreds of hours over Zoom between the Problem Solvers and the bipartisan group of senators, it seems like we may have broken the biggest impasse in recent Congressional history – all to help families, small businesses and communities beat the pandemic,” Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., said.

2020-12-20 22:31:06+00:00,40,"MIAMI — As vaccinations against the coronavirus begin to roll out across the country, Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo says he's been getting many questions from his predominantly Latino patients, including whether the vaccine contains the virus and whether there are side effects to taking it.

“People are not sure what’s in the vaccines. They want to know,” said Carrasquillo, the chief of general internal medicine at the University of Miami and one of the principal investigators for the Janssen vaccine trial.

Covid-19 has hit U.S. Latinos disproportionately hard in many areas of the U.S., making vaccinations a crucial public health mission. But doctors like Carrasquillo are hearing skepticism about the vaccines because of the lack of reliable information, especially in Spanish, coupled with disinformation that has been circulating.

Of all the questions Carrasquillo’s patients have come to him with, what alarms him most are conspiracy theories about the vaccine. He says they have sent him videos in English with supposed doctors falsely claiming that the vaccines will alter people’s DNA.

Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a Democratic strategist who had been keeping track of disinformation appearing in Spanish over the November elections, says anti-vaccine propaganda has intensified in recent weeks among Latinos.

While some of it consists of QAnon conspiracy theories, she's also seeing memes or jokes about side effects.

While the jokes may seem harmless, “it’s the repetition that worries me,"" Pérez-Verdía said. ""People are seeing this constantly.”

Carrasquillo says this is the moment for Latino leaders, including doctors, Spanish-language media, and Hispanic elected officials, to step up.

“We’re the ones who are going to have to take that charge up and reassure our community,” Carrasquillo said.

Around 63 percent of Hispanics say they would definitely or probably get a Covid-19 vaccine, a higher number than white adults, who stand at 61 percent, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.

But another recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation asking more specific questions found that only 26 percent of Hispanics said they would get the vaccine as soon as possible, compared to 40 percent of whites. Around 43 percent of Latinos said they would “wait and see,” and 18 percent said they would definitely not get the vaccine, according to the survey.

Around the world, raising awareness about immunization so communities are educated and informed has always been key in executing successful vaccination campaigns. But the Covid-19 vaccines were developed so rapidly amid an intense election cycle and rising infection and death rates, that effective information targeting Latinos has been scarce.

In New York, Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician with NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center who sees children from heavily Hispanic neighborhoods, said she is seeing “distrust and fear” among her patients’ parents. They ask her what she ""really"" thinks about the vaccine, she says.

Bracho-Sanchez is seeing disinformation circulate among large WhatsApp groups. “The network has been used in our community to warn each other of things, like ‘la migra,'"" or immigration officers, Bracho-Sanchez said. “These are networks that have grown out of necessity in the past few years. They are established. They are well rehearsed and well set up to spread disinformation.""

Because Covid-19 has hit Latino neighborhoods hard, the fear makes residents vulnerable to disinformation, she said. It’s important to message the vaccine well and at a level that everyone understands, Bracho-Sanchez said.

Among farmworkers, fear, but also hope

For farmworkers, who are among the nation's essential workers, Covid-19 has been rampant since the start of the pandemic.

In California’s Salinas Valley, known as “America’s Salad Bowl,” about 20 percent of farmworkers tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in October, versus 5 percent of the state’s population, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley.

Many farmworkers work and live in crowded conditions that make an ideal environment for virus transmission.

Dr. Alexandra Franco specializes in internal medicine and infectious diseases at Clinica Sierra Vista in Bakersfield, one of several federally funded clinics that provide care to the underserved community in the Central Valley area. She says she has heard all kinds of conspiracy theories from patients.

Many are Mexican and Central American migrants who work in the grape and orange fields. Traumatized from Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, some have approached Franco with fears over whether the vaccine is being used to “get rid of them,” or how the vaccine will allow the government to track them down and deport them. Patients have heard it will reduce women’s fertility, and one even commented on the vaccine changing their gender.

“The bright side is that among Latino field workers, I would say the majority wants to get the vaccine,” said Franco.

Some farmworkers are proactively calling the clinic to ask when the vaccine will arrive and when they can get it. “That’s the reassuring part,” Franco said.

Franco and other health care experts advocated for getting the vaccine sooner to farmworkers. She said Clinica Sierra Vista should be getting the Moderna vaccine next week and could be vaccinating farmworkers as early as the first week in January after their health care workers get it. Intensive care units around Central California, she said, are full of patients who are Latino farmworkers that have contracted the disease.

“I think if we get them vaccinated sooner than the regular community, we may see a positive impact at least in our ICU capacity,” said Franco.

Groups are mobilizing

Across the country, hospitals, clinics and community leaders are mobilizing to educate and reassure the public about the vaccine. Latino elected officials like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-TX, have tweeted pictures of themselves receiving the vaccine in an effort to raise awareness.

A Latino Decisions poll conducted in early October for the national advocacy organization UnidosUS found that 82 percent of Hispanics said they would trust their doctor or medical provider as a source on vaccine safety information.

Carrasquillo, the University of Miami doctor, who already had the first dose of the vaccine, is the principal investigator in a statewide outreach program that received a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to engage minority communities about the vaccine. The effort, called the Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) Against Covid-19 Disparities, includes a diverse group of experts at multiple universities throughout the state.

NewYork-Presbyterian recently launched the Dalio Center for Health Justice, and it will be working closely with community-based organizations as the vaccine is rolled out to educate and raise awareness.

""We're doing a lot of community presentations and a lot of community forums,"" Carrasquillo said.

2020-12-20 22:01:04+00:00,33,"Dr. Michael Saag cannot get enough monoclonal antibodies to treat Covid-19.

They're not for him, personally; he still has natural antibodies to the coronavirus since recovering from the illness this past March.

But Saag, an infectious disease physician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said he would take the monoclonal antibodies — made in a lab to mirror the body's natural immune response to the virus — ""in a heartbeat"" if he were to be infected a second time.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""Monoclonal antibody products are a godsend to those patients who are eligible and are seen by us early in the course of illness,"" Saag said. ""The earlier, the better.""

Unlike the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone — both of which are given to patients hospitalized with Covid-19 — monoclonal antibodies are the only therapy authorized by the Food and Drug Administration so far that is meant to prevent patients from being hospitalized in the first place. The FDA has granted emergency use authorization to two drugmakers — Eli Lilly and Regeneron — for their monoclonal antibody products.

But many doses sit untouched at health care facilities across the country, with providers reluctant to them.

""A lot of us in infectious disease aren't sure that the monoclonal antibodies are worth the effort,"" said Dr. Christopher Ohl, a professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Some doctors on the front lines of treating Covid-19 patients have actually declined their allotments of the treatment, citing lack of evidence it really works.

""This is not something that's ready for prime time,"" said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and physician with the Cambridge Health Alliance Respiratory Clinic near Boston.

In fact, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which helps guide clinicians, recommends against routine use of monoclonal antibodies, citing insufficient proof they work. The National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines also indicate there is not enough data to recommend their use.

There is some early evidence that monoclonal antibodies can reduce the amount of virus in a person's system, referred to as viral load. Last week, drugmaker Regeneron published in the New England Journal of Medicine preliminary findings on 275 patients showing such a reduction, ""with a greater effect in patients whose immune response had not yet been initiated or who had a high viral load at baseline.""

Cohen acknowledged the findings, but added, ""We have no idea what viral load means in terms of outcomes for patients with Covid."" That is, will reducing the amount of virus in a person's body change the course of their illness?

President Donald Trump received the monoclonal antibodies made by Regeneron when he was hospitalized with Covid-19 and later claimed they were a ""cure"" — though it's impossible to pinpoint precisely how much they helped amid the variety of treatments he received.

Meanwhile, Operation Warp Speed officials have all but begged physicians to use available doses of the monoclonal antibodies.

Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said last week that the usage of monoclonal antibodies thus far is ""disappointing."" His data showed that between 5 and 20 percent of the nation's supply had been used.

""Many states do have product available,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. ""The best time to get those antibodies is not when you show up in the emergency room, but soon after being diagnosed with Covid.""

Both Eli Lilly's and Regeneron's monoclonal antibodies are meant to treat Covid-19 patients who are also at high risk of developing complications that might lead to hospitalization. But they must be given in the first four to seven days of their illness.

Eli Lilly said its preliminary analysis of its monoclonal antibody appeared to show a reduction in hospitalizations or visits to an emergency department. Those Phase 2 results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late October.

The idea of keeping hospitalizations to a minimum is tantalizing, particularly as the nation continues to log astronomical numbers of cases. As of Dec. 18, more than 114,000 people were currently hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the Covid Tracking Project. That's the largest number of hospitalizations reported in the U.S. since the pandemic began.

But administering the drugs can be costly and complicated for providers. Monoclonal antibodies are given intravenously, in an hourlong infusion, with an entire appointment lasting about three to four hours.

And because eligible Covid-19 patients are highly contagious, they must be kept separated from other vulnerable patients in need of outpatient infusions, such as those receiving chemotherapy for cancer.

""You have to have a dedicated infusion center for a dedicated amount of time,"" Ohl, of Wake Forest, said. ""There's not a lot of us rushing out to give this stuff.""

We're swamped just trying to figure out how to make sure there's enough room for everyone who's sick with Covid to get proper care.

The treatments, Cohen said, ""are not a good use of our health care resources right now. We're swamped just trying to figure out how to make sure there's enough room for everyone who's sick with Covid to get proper care.""

""To carve out those kinds of resources for an experimental treatment is not what I would recommend,"" he added.

Other facilities, too, have cited logistical complications for the infusions, redirecting their monoclonal antibody supplies to larger institutions, such as Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

Dr. Karen Bloch, an infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt, said her team has about 500 doses available. ""We are actively reaching out to patients who meet high-risk criteria and trying to get them treated within the first seven days after onset of illness,"" she said.

Anecdotally, Bloch said patients who've received the monoclonal antibodies have had ""fantastic responses.""

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Saag, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said in his experience, the treatment ""has performed very well, much better by far than anything else we have used.""

Saag said a main problem hindering his use of the monoclonal antibodies is that most patients are either referred to him too late, after seven days of illness, or they don't meet criteria outlined in the FDA's emergency use authorization for the treatment: over age 65 or have significant underlying health problems.

Medicines authorized for emergency use must follow strict guidelines outlined in the EUA, as it's called, so doctors do not have the flexibility to try them in other groups.

All agree: Larger, more robust studies of monoclonal antibodies are needed. Some are already in full swing.

Dr. Raymund Razonable, a professor of medicine and principal investigator of monoclonal antibody studies at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, has overseen more than 900 antibody infusions spread across Mayo's centers nationwide.

Razonable's research is not yet completed, but anecdotally, he and his colleagues have found that about 2.6 percent of high-risk patients who have received the monoclonal antibodies end up hospitalized, versus about 10 percent of such patients who don't receive the treatment.

""This is really important for us as an institution,"" Razonable said, ""because we're seeing increasing numbers of hospitalizations, to the point that we are expanding several units in the hospital to accommodate Covid patients.""

One key may be effective communication and education in the public. If people who test positive for Covid-19 are unaware they could qualify for monoclonal antibodies, they will not seek treatment until it's too late.

""You want to catch them before they are not really feeling that sick yet,"" Razonable said, acknowledging doctors have a narrow window of opportunity to use the treatment.

""If you catch them early, the hope is that it will not lead to hospitalization,"" he said. ""If we can prevent that from happening, it's going to be useful.""

On Sunday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of the recommendations, which will go on to the CDC for final approval.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The new proposal comes less than a week after the first Covid-19 vaccines went out to health care workers and people living in long-term care facilities across the country. That group is referred to as Phase 1A. The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to two Covid-19 vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

In addition to those 75 and older, the next phase, deemed Phase 1B, would include first responders, such as firefighters and police officers, as well as teachers, day care staff and others working in education. Corrections officers, U.S. postal workers, public transit workers and those whose jobs are essential for the food supply — from farmers to grocery store employees — are also next up to receive the vaccine. Altogether, this group includes about 49 million people.

The shots are not expected imminently, but they should begin in the coming weeks, depending on how quickly a sufficient number of people in Phase 1A are vaccinated.

The reason the committee needed to recommend specific groups to specific phases of rollout is simple: There is not enough vaccine yet for everyone who needs one.

Given the limitations, ""difficult choices have to be made,"" Dr. Kathleen Dooling, an ACIP member, said during the meeting Sunday. ""Members of the working group strongly support vaccination being offered to every person in the United States as soon as possible,"" calling the committee's proposal ""a road map for how we can get there together.""

In determining who should be next in line, the committee said it took into account input from a wide variety of scientists, ethicists and vaccination experts, as well as the general public. It has been consistently clear that older people are most vulnerable to the devastating impacts of Covid-19.

Even though the rates of coronavirus infection are highest among young adults, the illness is deadliest among older adults. What's more, ""over the course of this year, adults 75 years and older have accounted for 25 percent of Covid-19-associated hospitalizations, despite making up approximately 8 percent of the population,"" Dooling said.

Including front-line essential workers in Phase 1B ensures that individuals who are most likely to be exposed to the virus are protected.

""Front-line workers in particular are unable to work from home and have a high level of interaction with the public or others in the workplace,"" Dooling said.

The CDC committee also voted Sunday on who should be included in Phase 1C of vaccination. This phase would include adults ages 65 to 74, as well as anyone ages 16 and older with an underlying health problem that would put them at greater risk for complications from Covid-19.

Those conditions include type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and certain heart conditions. The committee said people with chronic illnesses should speak with their doctor about their eligibility.

Phase 1C also includes remaining essential workers — including those who work in the transportation, energy, public safety and water management industries — as well as those in information technology, banking, media and the justice system, such as judges and lawyers. Waiters, fast-food workers and other people in the food service industry are also included.

A major ethical issue in front of the committee has been how it's considered racial and ethnic minorities, groups that have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19. But according to data presented at the ACIP meeting, front-line essential workers first in line, in Phase 1B, are more likely to be white Americans, while there is significant representation of minority groups in other essential workers, in Phase 1C.

Altogether, Phase 1C totals about 129 million people. The recommendations may need to be adapted over the coming months as the vaccine supplies fluctuate.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who leads the CDC's work on vaccines for Covid-19, explained during the meeting Sunday that her staff has tried to ""walk a careful line"" by offering explanations for the agency's recommendations, while leaving some room for ""those on the front lines of jurisdictions that actually have to translate this into implementable guidance."" States will ultimately make those final decisions.

Those who will need to wait include virtually everyone else in the country; that is, anyone ages 16 and older not included in the first phases. The advisory committee is expected to address that rollout at a later date.

Despite Covid-19 eviction ban, tenants still being thrown out The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s eviction moratorium was supposed to protect renters in all 50 states through the end of the year. Keeping Covid-affected renters in their apartments, the CDC said, would reduce the potential for virus transmission likely to occur as displaced people were forced to move in with family or friends or into homeless shelters. But nationwide adherence to the moratorium has been spotty, housing experts say. Some judges are rejecting the moratorium outright, while others are evicting based on landlord-friendly state regulations or disputed claims about tenants violating their leases. Evictions processed while the moratorium is still in place are a preview of what some experts predict will be a wave of homelessness when the CDC moratorium expires on Dec. 31. Access to Congressional funds earmarked for rental assistance also ends then, programs that have helped landlords as well as renters. Read the full story. Share this -

Mental health care resources stretched thin during pandemic In a year of more than 300,000 deaths from a pandemic, job insecurity, a looming eviction crisis and a renewed focus on racial injustice, mental health has been pushed into the public discourse across the country. Politicians have implemented new strategies to acknowledge disparities in quality of care for people seeking health providers and have attempted to address mental health through policy. But questions remain as to whether systems will change enough to normalize mental health care following a year of collective trauma. In June, an estimated 40 percent of U.S. adults reported struggling with some form of mental health or substance abuse issues, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published in August. There was a threefold increase in adults reporting anxiety and four times the reports of feelings of depression compared to the same time the year before, the CDC found. Read the full story.

More European Union nations ban travel from U.K. Mutant Covid strain blocks British from traveling Dec. 20, 2020 01:52 BERLIN — A growing list of European Union nations barred travel from the U.K. on Sunday and others were considering similar action, in a bid to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from spreading to the continent. France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Bulgaria all announced restrictions on U.K. travel, hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Christmas shopping and gatherings in southern England must be canceled because of rapidly spreading infections blamed on the new coronavirus variant. Johnson immediately placed those regions under a strict new Tier 4 restriction level, upending Christmas plans for millions. France banned all travel from the U.K. for 48 hours from midnight Sunday, including trucks carrying freight through the tunnel under the English Channel or from the port of Dover on England's south coast. French officials said the pause would buy time to find a “common doctrine” on how to deal with the threat, but it threw the busy cross-channel route used by thousands of trucks a day into chaos.

Hospital staffs stretched thin during California virus surge California hospitals overwhelmed: “I’m not going to sugarcoat this” Dec. 20, 2020 02:15 LOS ANGELES — Medical staffing is stretched increasingly thin as California hospitals scramble to find beds for patients amid an explosion of coronavirus cases that threatens to overwhelm the state's emergency care system. On Sunday, more than 16,840 people were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infections — more than double the previous peak reached in July. A state model that uses current data to forecast future trends shows the number could reach 75,000 by mid-January. More than 3,610 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care units. All of Southern California and the 12-county San Joaquin Valley to the north have exhausted their regular ICU capacity, and some hospitals have begun using “surge” space. Overall, the state’s ICU capacity was just 2.1% on Sunday. The enormous crush of cases in the last six weeks has California’s death toll spiraling ever higher. An additional o 161 fatalities were reported Sunday for a total of 22,593. Many hospitals are preparing for the possibility of rationing care. A document recently circulated among doctors at the four hospitals run by Los Angeles County calls for them to shift strategy: Instead of trying everything to save a life, their goal during the crisis is to save as many patients as possible. That means those less likely to survive won’t get the same kind of care offered in normal times. Share this -

CDC advisory group: Older adults, frontline essential workers to get Covid vaccine next People ages 75 and up and frontline essential workers will be next in line to receive Covid-19 vaccines, according to recommendations from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee. On Sunday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of the recommendations, which will go on to the CDC for final sign off. The new proposal comes less than a week after the first Covid-19 vaccines went out to health care workers and those living in long-term care facilities across the country. That group is referred to as phase 1a. The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to two Covid-19 vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

Thailand to test over 10,000 people after record COVID-19 surge Thailand plans to test more than 10,000 people after a record daily surge in coronavirus cases to over 500, most of which were among migrant workers linked to a shrimp market near the capital, an official said on Sunday. By Wednesday the authorities aim to conduct 10,300 tests in the southwest province of Samut Sakhon, where the outbreak appeared, and other nearby provinces, a spokesman for Thailand's Covid-19 taskforce, told a news conference. ""Active case findings will continue in several provinces, actually across the country,"" he said. Thailand, the first country outside China to report coronavirus infections, has largely kept the outbreak under control with 4,907 cases and 60 deaths. Share this -

Fauci tells kids not to worry, he gave Santa Claus the Covid-19 vaccine Worried children can rest easy after the nation’s leading infectious disease expert assured them on Saturday that Santa Claus has gotten a Covid-19 vaccine.

Fauci was answering questions from children during a Sesame Street town hall with CNN when the concern arose. “Will Santa still be able to visit me in coronavirus this season,” 6-year-old Paxton from Illinois asked. “What if he can’t go to anyone’s house or near his reindeer?” “I took a trip up there to the North Pole,” Fauci said. “I went there and I vaccinated Santa Claus myself.

Mistrust, disinformation among Latinos on Covid vaccine worries Hispanic doctors As vaccinations against the coronavirus begin to roll out across the country, Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo says he's been getting many questions from his predominantly Latino patients, including whether the vaccine contains the virus and whether there are side effects to taking it. “People are not sure what’s in the vaccines. They want to know,” said Carrasquillo, the chief of general internal medicine at the University of Miami and one of the principal investigators for the Janssen vaccine trial. Covid-19 has hit U.S. Latinos disproportionately hard in many areas of the U.S., making vaccinations a crucial public health mission. But doctors like Carrasquillo are hearing skepticism about the vaccines because of the lack of reliable information, especially in Spanish, coupled with disinformation that has been circulating.

European neighbors restrict travel to U.K. as new virus strain spreads Several European countries placed new travel restrictions on the United Kingdom on Sunday amid concern over a new strain of the coronavirus that is spreading rapidly in the country's capital and the southeast of England. In an effort to prevent the new variant from spreading across country lines, Belgium said it would close its borders to trains and planes coming from the U.K. and the Netherlands also suspended flights. Italy's foreign minister indicated his government was planning a similar ban. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and scientists announced on Saturday that the new virus strain, which is 70 percent more transmissible than existing strains, had led to spiraling infection numbers. The U.K. government subsequently tightened its Covid-19 restrictions for London and nearby areas, disrupting the Christmas holiday plans of millions of people. Share this -

Rose Bowl loses college football semifinal over region's surge A college football semifinal scheduled to take place Jan. 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, has been moved to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Rose Bowl officials announced Saturday night. The move was the result of the region's surge in coronavirus cases, the venue said. Los Angeles County health officials Saturday said they have counted more than 600,000 cases since the pandemic began. State pandemic restrictions include 20 percent capacity at essential retailers and no dining. The city of Pasadena is in Los Angeles County but has its own health department that keeps a separate tally of cases. On Saturday it recorded 5,497 cases since the pandemic started. The Rose Bowl cited a regional strain on ""medical resources"" as well as ""word late this week that the State of California would not make a special exception for player guests at the game,"" according to a statement. ""The decision to move the game is based on the growing number of COVID-19 cases in Southern California along with the inability to host player and coach guests at any game in California,"" the Rose Bowl said.

Outbreak in Sydney's beach suburbs grows to 70 cases SYDNEY — Sydney's coronavirus outbreak grew to around 70 on Sunday, forcing authorities to introduce stricter social distancing rules across the city and more states to close borders or impose quarantine measures on its residents. The neighboring state of Victoria will close its border to Sydney from midnight Sunday. South Australia state introduced a 14-day quarantine for all Sydney arrivals on Sunday and banned travelers from the affected suburbs. The island state of Tasmania took a similar step on Saturday, while Western Australia state imposed a hard border closure. About a quarter of a million people in Sydney's northern beach suburbs, where the outbreak has occurred, have been put into a strict lockdown until Christmas Eve. Share this -

""I’m sure all Americans are excited to see me, the guy who let Covid spread everywhere, get one of the first vaccines,"" said Pence, played by Beck Bennett.

The vice president, who chairs the White House's coronavirus task force, sought to reassure Americans who have doubts about the safety of the vaccine.

""I just want reassure the American people that this vaccine is completely safe and harmless,"" he said. ""That’s why President Trump refuses to talk about it.""

Pence apologized for the president. ""He may not be doing president anymore, but he still cares deeply about not going to prison,"" he said.

Pence said the vaccination, meanwhile, was painless.

""For the past four years,"" he said, ""I haven't felt a thing—just kind of watched the country burn.""

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris joined the fray, and Pence asked her, ""How did you get into the White House.""

""I won more votes,"" she said.

President-elect Joe Biden (Alex Moffatt) joined the others and proclaimed that change was coming.

""You're about to have a real leader again,"" he said. ""And you're about to have the most diverse Cabinet in the history of American politics.""

2020-12-20 14:01:02+00:00,64,"LONDON — Millions of people in London and the U.K.'s southeast will be forced to cancel their Christmas plans after scientists said Saturday that a new coronavirus variant was spreading more quickly.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that the toughest set of coronavirus restrictions — known as ""Tier 4"" — will be put in place from Sunday, putting regions under the strictest lockdown rules.

As a result, nonessential shops, gyms, cinemas, hairdressers and bowling alleys will be forced to close for two weeks, while people will be restricted to meeting one other person from another household in an outdoor public space.

A ""bubble"" policy — allowing up to three households to meet over the holiday period in parts of the country that are not under Tier 4 restrictions — will be severely curtailed and will only apply on Christmas Day, Johnson said.

He added that he ""bitterly regretted"" the changes, but insisted they were ""necessary.""

""Alas, when the facts change, you have to change your approach,"" he said, adding that a briefing he had on Friday ""about this mutation of the virus, particularly about the speed of transmission, was not possible to ignore.""

""The message is that this is the year to lift a glass to those who aren't there, in the knowledge that it's precisely because they're not there to celebrate Christmas with you this year that we all have a better chance that they'll be there next year,"" he said.

Johnson spoke out after he was advised by scientists that the new coronavirus variant was spreading more rapidly.

The chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said in a statement Saturday that the U.K. had informed the World Health Organization about the mutant strain.

""As announced on Monday, the U.K. has identified a new variant of Covid-19 through Public Health England's genomic surveillance,"" he said, adding that preliminary modeling data and rising cases in the country's southeast showed ""the new strain can spread more quickly.""

He added that scientists were ""continuing to analyze the available data to improve our understanding.""

However, he insisted that there was ""no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is under way to confirm this.""

There has been mounting anxiety across as Britain — like other countries across Europe — is working to curb a second wave of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and the government is having to defend a plan to relax contact restrictions for five days over the Christmas period in order to lift the national mood.

""The government was too slow to introduce restrictions in the spring and again in the autumn. It should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing,"" the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal said in a unique joint editorial this week.

The government was already under intense scrutiny for what many say has been a repeated mishandling of the crisis. More than 66,000 people have died — leaving the U.K. with one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world.

With fears that the relaxing of the restrictions over the holiday period could lead to a further upward spike, Johnson did not rule out the possibility of a third national lockdown for England in the new year.

He told reporters Friday, ""We're hoping very much that we will be able to avoid anything like that. But the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks.""

2020-12-20 11:32:08+00:00,48,"United Airlines is working with health officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help them contact passengers who might have been exposed to Covid-19 after a man suffered ""a medical emergency"" during a flight this week and died, the airline said in a statement.

The incident took place during an Orlando-to-Los-Angeles flight on Monday. The flight diverted to New Orleans when a man became ill on the plane. Paramedics transported the male passenger to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to United Airlines.

""Everything felt so intense and not real,"" Shay Allen, a passenger on the flight, told NBC Los Angeles. Allen said she saw the man board the plane with his head down and breathing heavily. Less than 20 minutes into the flight, a nurse and an emergency medical technician began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him, according to Allen. She and other passengers indicated they overheard the man's wife say he had been experiencing Covid-like symptoms.

“At the time of the diversion, we were informed he had suffered a cardiac arrest, so passengers were given the option to take a later flight or continue on with their travel plans,” the airline said. ""Now that the CDC has contacted us directly, we are sharing requested information with the agency so they can work with local health officials to conduct outreach to any customer the CDC believes may be at risk for possible exposure or infection.""

The male passenger had filled out a required checklist before boarding the flight, saying he had not tested positive for Covid and did not have symptoms. But it's apparent that he ""wrongly acknowledged this requirement,” the airline said.

The CDC said in a statement that they are in the ""process of collecting information and proceeding according to our standard operating procedures to determine if further public health action is appropriate."" The agency is not providing any information about the deceased passenger ""to protect the privacy of the individual.""

Allen said she has been quarantining at home in California as required by the state. By Friday, she had not been contacted by health officials, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Four flight attendants who worked on the flight have also gone into quarantine for 14 days after the plane landed in Los Angeles, Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for Association of Flight Attendants, told NBC Los Angeles.

“Our union continues to provide support to the crew,” Garland said. “We urge passengers to comply with airline COVID policies and stay home if you’re sick.”",MSNBC,"['possible', 'nbc', 'warns', 'los', 'health', 'airlines', 'officials', 'death', 'covidrelated', 'airline', 'flight', 'exposure', 'cdc', 'plane', 'passengers', 'united', 'passenger']",0
2020-12-20 11:01:04+00:00,76,"Rodney Wyatt has lived more than a few lives in his 52 years.

There was his life in the drug trade more than a decade ago that landed him a 22-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and his life as a loving father and fiancé. There’s his life as a patient, in which he has suffered two heart attacks and endured 42 rounds of radiation treatments for prostate cancer.

And there’s his life now, as one of more than 620 prisoners at FCI Loretto in Pennsylvania who contracted Covid-19 in the last month in what was, by mid-December, the worst outbreak in the federal prison system.

“He said it’s just like a war zone,” said Chantel Tyler, 43, Wyatt’s fiancé. “They’re coughing on each other. Guys are vomiting on each other because they’re so close.”

Wyatt hoped that his illnesses would qualify him for compassionate release, but like most federal prisoners who applied, Wyatt was denied. The Bureau of Prisons also has not granted him home confinement, as it did for Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman.

The Bureau released Manafort, 71, to home confinement in May, after Manafort’s lawyers argued he was at higher risk due to heart disease and past illness. Wyatt remains locked down in a prison where coronavirus has spread like wildfire.

As a brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country, a second wave is also pummeling the federal Bureau of Prisons. Within the last month, about 12,000 prisoners have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of federal prisoners who have contracted the disease during the pandemic to more than 32,000. More than 2,500 staff have also been infected.

The outbreak is reigniting questions over why certain inmates – but not others – are granted early release or home confinement, and about the BOP’s measures to stem the spread inside.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Despite time to plan in recent months, and a scathing inspector general report that found deadly mistakes at a Louisiana facility this summer, Loretto was caught flatfooted, according to prisoners, their families and advocates.

Men were tested too slowly and not separated quickly enough, prisoners and advocates said. Those with symptoms were put in pods meant for those without the virus. The prisoners in the segregation unit have gone weeks without basic supplies, like sufficient soap, according to interviews and a lawsuit filed by men inside.

Federal Correctional Institution at Loretto. Federal Bureau of Prisons

The agency has also failed to consistently test those most likely to carry the virus into the facilities, and back out to the community: the staff.

At a hearing of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 2, lawmakers grilled BOP Director Michael Carvajal about the agency’s failure to offer universal on-site testing to correctional officers and staff, who move in and out of the facility each day.

“You’re talking about individuals coming in contact with incarcerated persons who can’t walk away, can’t get out” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas. “That means they are endangering themselves. Their families at home.”

Carvajal said the BOP could not mandate staff to test.

“We can offer the testing,” said Carvajal. “People don’t want to take it. We can’t make them.”

Watching the hearing from his sickbed, where he was cramped with body aches from COVID-19, Francis Bailey, a correctional officer at Loretto, was furious.

“I can tell you now that FCI Loretto has never been offered testing,” said Bailey, president of its union, American Federation of Government Employees Local 3951. “I have requested it multiple times, and have been told that it is a liability issue.”

Dozens of Bailey’s fellow officers have gotten sick. One staff member brought the disease home to his pregnant wife, Bailey said.

The Bureau of Prisons declined to answer specific questions about the outbreak at Loretto. Instead, the agency sent NBC News a lengthy email outlining the measures it has taken including curbing movement in and between facilities, quarantine measures, and releasing prisoners to serve out their time in home confinement.

“The efficacy of the BOP's mitigation strategies can be seen in the very low number of hospitalized inmates,” a spokesman wrote.

But to Bailey and the prisoners inside, that’s little comfort.

“In the 12 years in corrections, this is probably the scariest thing I’ve had to deal with, and the most stressful thing,” said Bailey. “We would like the Bureau to acknowledge that there’s a problem and that they’re doing something wrong.”

“Somebody Dropped the Ball”

The first big outbreak at Loretto came this summer, on the tail end of a wave that hit a lot of rural counties. The pandemic had been circulating in the Bureau of Prisons for months, but at Loretto, staff still scrambled.

After a prisoner who asked to be identified as LG tested positive, he was moved into a unit with more than 30 other infected men, he told NBC News in an email, asking to use his initials for fear of retribution. They had to share a urinal and two toilets, he said. Half a day after they were moved, they were given just two blankets apiece, according to LG and another prisoner. No bed rolls. No extra underwear. They were told, he said, that “somebody dropped the ball.” Throughout his 16 days there, LG said he received two rolls of toilet paper.

Colise Harmon, who also was quarantined with the virus this summer, said prisoners went more than 11 days without laundry service or cleaning supplies to disinfect their dorm, where sewage seeped across the floors.

“Third world countries treat their incarcerated better than this,” Harmon wrote in an email. Both Harmon and LG had their petitions for compassionate release denied.

In memos issued early in the pandemic, U.S. Attorney General William Barr urged the Bureau of Prisons to take measures to release vulnerable prisoners.

But data compiled by the Marshall Project show federal prison wardens denied or ignored more than 98 percent of compassionate release requests. At least two prisoners at Loretto received letters saying that because they did not have a terminal disease with less than 18 months to live, and could still perform daily tasks, they did not qualify.

Barr also directed the Bureau to “prioritize home confinement,” allowing prisoners to serve their time at home, under supervision. About 18,000 people have been released to home confinement. which prioritizes nonviolent, medically-vulnerable inmates who have served at least half their time, or are within 18 months of their release date. But advocates and prisoners said the agency has denied many prisoners who meet the criteria, including men at the low-security Loretto facility.

In early fall, as cases both inside and outside Loretto dropped, the prison began to lift some restrictions. Men were able to receive family visits after they had been suspended for months, according to prisoners and staff Loretto accepted new prisoners from the U.S. Marshals.

Staff were allowed to take paid leave if they were infected, but expected to come to work even if they had been exposed, said Bailey. As long as they passed a temperature check on arrival, they were considered cleared to work.

By November, Covid-19 was back. Late that month, Nelson Martinez said officials came and tested every man in Central 2, the dorm the 48-year-old with diabetes and asthma was living, still recovering from cataract surgery.

When he tested negative, Martinez said officers told him he’d be moved. Martinez recalled that another man who also tested negative was showing symptoms--he said he couldn’t smell or taste, and asked to be left behind with the positives.

The man wanted to help stop the spread, Martinez said. But he was moved with Martinez into the negative dorm anyway. The next day, Martinez tested positive. He said he was moved again.

Across the prison, men were shuffled from place to place in what prisoners and families describe as a poorly-considered effort to control the spread.

“They are herding the virus around the building,” said Harmon.

Wyatt, the prisoner with heart disease, was transferred to Loretto in late November from a medical prison in North Carolina. When he arrived, he was placed in a dorm with another man who was “clearly positive,” said Tyler, his fiancee. Within weeks of arriving, he had no taste or smell, his head was pounding and he was rushed into a dorm for the positive men.

By the middle of December, the number of active Covid-19 cases had soared to over 620, according to the Bureau of Prisons’ statistics. Staff and prisoners said they believed it was higher. Bailey, the union president, said that since March, all but about 90 of Loretto's 856 prisoners have contracted the virus.

They had so many positives that the efforts to quarantine left prisoners scattered across the facility, according to the accounts of prisoners and their families. There were sick men on cots in the gym, the visiting room, and, according to one account, on a block without windows or ventilation, where Harmon said plumbing is so bad that feces “just starts erupting out of the toilet.”

As hot spots spread into a full outbreak, Tyler rallied with other family members in a Facebook group. They called legislators. They flooded the warden’s office with email.

Anthony Serrano, who suffers from high blood pressure, pre-diabetes and severe sleep apnea, was also turned down for compassionate release by both the Bureau and a federal court.

U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said Serrano had made efforts to educate himself and remained a dedicated father, but said he had only served a third of his lengthy sentence. ""I am not convinced that Serrano is sufficiently reformed,” Hellerstein wrote.

On Dec. 7, Serrano, too, contracted the coronavirus.

As the outbreak spread, Serrano’s fiancé took to Twitter, furiously tagging U.S. Senator Cory Booker, actress Rosario Dawson, President Donald Trump. If she couldn’t get Serrano out, she said she needed someone with influence to take a look at what was happening inside.

“I find myself crying now and then, but I try to keep it together when I talk to him,” said the woman, who has been speaking out under the assumed name Liz Martinez to avoid retaliation. “I can’t be falling apart.”

For most of the men at Loretto, the only hope of getting free is to convince the judge who sentenced them that they should get early release. The chances are slim, and many have been turned down by judges who say they either have not served enough time, or still pose a risk to the community.

But 16 years after being sentenced on drug conspiracy charges, Martinez, the man recovering from cataracts, was granted compassionate release. He walked out of the prison on Dec. 4, squinting his still-healing eyes at his mother, who wrapped her arms tightly around her 48-year-old son.

Martinez didn’t escape Covid-19, but he’s recovering at home, where his mother can ply him with food and love. But even with Nelson out, the Martinez family hasn’t escaped the outbreak in the BOP.

Martinez’s younger brother Jeffery, one of his co-defendants in the 2005 case, is among nearly 100 prisoners hit by a coronavirus outbreak at FCI Danbury, in Connecticut.

“My other son is still there,” said Nelson’s mother Liana Martinez. “He’s scared.”",MSNBC,"['zone', 'release', 'loretto', 'outbreak', 'covid19', 'men', 'ravaged', 'prison', 'martinez', 'federal', 'prisoners', 'early', 'bureau', 'freed', 'paul', 'manafort', 'war', 'covid']",0

“I failed. I’m adjusting. I am fixing and we will move forward from there,” Gen. Gustave Perna told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Perna’s remarks came a day after a second vaccine was added in the fight against Covid-19, which has killed more than 312,000 people in the U.S. Governors in more than a dozen states have said the federal government has told them that next week’s shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be less than originally projected.

Perna acknowledged the criticism and accepted blame.

“I want to take personal responsibility for the miscommunication,” he said. “I know that’s not done much these days. But I am responsible. ... This is a Herculean effort and we are not perfect.”

The general said he made mistakes by citing numbers of doses that he believed would be ready.

“I am the one who approved forecast sheets. I’m the one who approved allocations,” Perna said. “There is no problem with the process. There is no problem with the Pfizer vaccine. There is no problem with the Moderna vaccine.”

There’s a distinction between manufactured vaccine and doses that are ready to be released. The finished product must undergo “rigorous quality control and sterility tests,” which can take up to a month, the Department of Health and Human Services said.

Perna said the government now is on track to get approximately 20 million doses to states by the first week of January, a combination of the newly approved Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Perna said 2.9 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses have been delivered to states so far.

In Michigan, where the Pfizer vaccine is produced, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday accused the White House of “slow-walking the process.”

2020-12-19 20:32:02+00:00,41,"Right up to the evening of Nov. 29, when Han Sim Hildebrand died, her family felt certain she was going to beat Covid-19 and make her way back home.

The 71-year-old Korean immigrant, who had come from an impoverished childhood to grow a thriving vegetable business in Columbia, Missouri, had seemed to be winning her nearly two-month battle with the virus. Having been weaned off a ventilator and put on a less intrusive oxygen flow, Han Sim had seemed in good spirits when her husband, Jim Hildebrand, visited several hours before he received the phone call that his wife had gone into cardiac arrest.

""Within a couple of days (of being off the ventilator), she was awake, waving at us, smiling — it was a miracle,"" her son, Chris Peters, an active duty naval officer, said. ""Even the nurses said, 'She's like a Houdini, we can't believe how fast she's come back.'

""It seemed like we had been through the darkest part.""

Persevering through the darkest parts of life, after all, had been what Chris' mom has been doing since an early age. Her family on both sides of the Pacific drew strength from her inspiration.

""Sim was 4 (feet), 11 (inches) and she's the mouse that could fight the lion,"" Jim, who was married to her for 32 years, said. ""I mean I'm 6 (feet), 2 (inches) and she always kept me under control.""

Born Jan. 7, 1949, Han Sim Kim was raised in a fishing village on the island of Dura-Ri off the southern tip of South Korea; the second eldest child in an impoverished family that included two brothers and four sisters.

Years later, she would tell Jim that cooking fires would require scrounging for pine needles for kindling — and there often wasn't much to cook beyond the yams her family grew.

""My mom told me stories about just suffering from hunger when she was very young, not being able to sleep when she was hungry,"" Chris said. ""She was sick a lot. She's only 4 (feet), 11 (inches), so she didn't grow very much.""

At the age of 20, Han Sim married an American military service member, and left her family behind to move to the other side of the world, where she would settle in Missouri. Until then, the two-hour boat ride from her island to the nearest port city, Yoesu, seemed far away.

""It was typical Sim,"" Jim said. ""She had to brave a lot of things, but she went ahead and braved them.""

""Her English was not good at first,"" her son said. ""It's not like there's a strong Korean community in northwest Missouri. She was probably the only Korean in a pretty wide radius. But she saw this as an opportunity for a better life.""

Han Sim's first marriage didn't last, but the couple had a daughter, Sharon Adhikary, and a second marriage produced her son, Chris. But by the time she married Jim, her third husband, she had carved out a life of her own in the American Midwest.

The couple met in a nightclub when she sent him a drink - setting the tone early for a marriage that would have reached its 33rd anniversary May 10.

While they worked other day jobs — Han Sim's included stints in factories and nursing homes — their shared passion became tending their vegetable patch, dubbed ""The Garden.""

""Both of us were raised on farms and so we kind of had it in our blood — even though she swore she would never farm again,"" Jim said.

By 2010, The Garden took up three quarters of the couple's two-acre homestead, producing 12 tons of vegetables a summer and enough of an income to become a full-time career.

The Hildebrands became staples at the Columbia Farmers Market, near the University of Missouri, where they stood out for their eclectic wares. They had tomatoes, sure, but also Korean turnips and Chinese cabbage. What they didn't sell, they donated to a local food bank.

When Han Sim wasn't kneeling in a field, she could be found doing so in a pew. A devoted attendee of the Columbia Korean Baptist Church, she brought her smile and dishes of Korean food to services and meetings three times a week as a deaconess.

""She's always smiling, lots of smiles, always joyful,"" Sho-Yeong Lee, the wife of the church's pastor and a close friend, said. ""She brought nice good Korean food all the time.

""She made everyone feel so comfortable. It’s a big loss for our church.""

Han Sim also never lost her connection to her roots, traveling back with her own children to visit her surviving brother and four sisters in Korea every two or three years. She also never lost the memory of that difficult childhood.

Chris said one of his favorite memories was watching his mom do a little dance of joy when she tasted something worthy of being pronounced, ""mash-isso,” Korean for delicious. Even better than eating, though, was cooking for others, including for her beloved granddaughters, Laura and Hanna.

Nothing much ever slowed her down until the severe back pain that drove her to the emergency room first Oct. 14, and again three days later, and turned out to be a symptom of something worse.

""She was very vivacious, she always made everybody feel loved and she loved everyone,"" Jim said of his wife. ""She always had a big smile on her face. When she met somebody, she always was nice to them. I've never seen her have a cross word with anybody.

The incident took place during an Orlando-to-Los-Angeles flight on Monday. The flight diverted to New Orleans when a man became ill on the plane. Paramedics transported the male passenger to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to United Airlines.

""Everything felt so intense and not real,"" Shay Allen, a passenger on the flight, told NBC Los Angeles. Allen said she saw the man board the plane with his head down and breathing heavily. Less than 20 minutes into the flight, a nurse and an emergency medical technician began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him, according to Allen. She and other passengers indicated they overheard the man's wife say he had been experiencing Covid-like symptoms.

“At the time of the diversion, we were informed he had suffered a cardiac arrest, so passengers were given the option to take a later flight or continue on with their travel plans,” the airline said. ""Now that the CDC has contacted us directly, we are sharing requested information with the agency so they can work with local health officials to conduct outreach to any customer the CDC believes may be at risk for possible exposure or infection.""

The male passenger had filled out a required checklist before boarding the flight, saying he had not tested positive for Covid and did not have symptoms. But it's apparent that he ""wrongly acknowledged this requirement,” the airline said.

The CDC said in a statement that they are in the ""process of collecting information and proceeding according to our standard operating procedures to determine if further public health action is appropriate."" The agency is not providing any information about the deceased passenger ""to protect the privacy of the individual.""

Allen said she has been quarantining at home in California as required by the state. By Friday, she had not been contacted by health officials, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Four flight attendants who worked on the flight have also gone into quarantine for 14 days after the plane landed in Los Angeles, Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for Association of Flight Attendants, told NBC Los Angeles.

2020-12-19 17:46:03+00:00,92,"LONDON — Millions of people in London and the U.K.'s southeast will be forced to cancel their Christmas plans after scientists said Saturday that a new coronavirus variant was spreading more quickly.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that the toughest set of coronavirus restrictions — known as ""Tier 4"" — will be put in place from Sunday, putting regions under the strictest lockdown rules.

As a result, nonessential shops, gyms, cinemas, hairdressers and bowling alleys will be forced to close for two weeks, while people will be restricted to meeting one other person from another household in an outdoor public space.

A ""bubble"" policy — allowing up to three households to meet over the holiday period in parts of the country that are not under Tier 4 restrictions — will be severely curtailed and will only apply on Christmas Day, Johnson said.

He added that he ""bitterly regretted"" the changes, but insisted they were ""necessary.""

""Alas, when the facts change, you have to change your approach,"" he said, adding that a briefing he had on Friday ""about this mutation of the virus, particularly about the speed of transmission, was not possible to ignore.""

""The message is that this is the year to lift a glass to those who aren't there, in the knowledge that it's precisely because they're not there to celebrate Christmas with you this year that we all have a better chance that they'll be there next year,"" he said.

Johnson spoke out after he was advised by scientists that the new coronavirus variant was spreading more rapidly.

The chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said in a statement Saturday that the U.K. had informed the World Health Organization about the mutant strain.

""As announced on Monday, the U.K. has identified a new variant of Covid-19 through Public Health England's genomic surveillance,"" he said, adding that preliminary modeling data and rising cases in the country's southeast showed ""the new strain can spread more quickly.""

He added that scientists were ""continuing to analyze the available data to improve our understanding.""

However, he insisted that there was ""no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments although urgent work is under way to confirm this.""

There has been mounting anxiety across as Britain — like other countries across Europe — is working to curb a second wave of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and the government is having to defend a plan to relax contact restrictions for five days over the Christmas period in order to lift the national mood.

""The government was too slow to introduce restrictions in the spring and again in the autumn. It should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing,"" the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal said in a unique joint editorial this week.

The government was already under intense scrutiny for what many say has been a repeated mishandling of the crisis. More than 66,000 people have died — leaving the U.K. with one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world.

With fears that the relaxing of the restrictions over the holiday period could lead to a further upward spike, Johnson did not rule out the possibility of a third national lockdown for England in the new year.

He told reporters Friday, ""We're hoping very much that we will be able to avoid anything like that. But the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks.""

2020-12-19 17:16:04+00:00,57,"Rodney Wyatt has lived more than a few lives in his 52 years.

There was his life in the drug trade more than a decade ago that landed him a 22-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and his life as a loving father and fiancé. There’s his life as a patient, in which he has suffered two heart attacks and endured 42 rounds of radiation treatments for prostate cancer.

And there’s his life now, as one of more than 620 prisoners at FCI Loretto in Pennsylvania who contracted Covid-19 in the last month in what was, by mid-December, the worst outbreak in the federal prison system.

“He said it’s just like a war zone,” said Chantel Tyler, 43, Wyatt’s fiancé. “They’re coughing on each other. Guys are vomiting on each other because they’re so close.”

Wyatt hoped that his illnesses would qualify him for compassionate release, but like most federal prisoners who applied, Wyatt was denied. The Bureau of Prisons also has not granted him home confinement, as it did for Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman.

The Bureau released Manafort, 71, to home confinement in May, after Manafort’s lawyers argued he was at higher risk due to heart disease and past illness. Wyatt remains locked down in a prison where coronavirus has spread like wildfire.

As a brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country, a second wave is also pummeling the federal Bureau of Prisons. Within the last month, about 12,000 prisoners have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of federal prisoners who have contracted the disease during the pandemic to more than 32,000. More than 2,500 staff have also been infected.

The outbreak is reigniting questions over why certain inmates – but not others – are granted early release or home confinement, and about the BOP’s measures to stem the spread inside.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Despite time to plan in recent months, and a scathing inspector general report that found deadly mistakes at a Louisiana facility this summer, Loretto was caught flatfooted, according to prisoners, their families and advocates.

Men were tested too slowly and not separated quickly enough, prisoners and advocates said. Those with symptoms were put in pods meant for those without the virus. The prisoners in the segregation unit have gone weeks without basic supplies, like sufficient soap, according to interviews and a lawsuit filed by men inside.

Federal Correctional Institution at Loretto. Federal Bureau of Prisons

The agency has also failed to consistently test those most likely to carry the virus into the facilities, and back out to the community: the staff.

At a hearing of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 2, lawmakers grilled BOP Director Michael Carvajal about the agency’s failure to offer universal on-site testing to correctional officers and staff, who move in and out of the facility each day.

“You’re talking about individuals coming in contact with incarcerated persons who can’t walk away, can’t get out” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas. “That means they are endangering themselves. Their families at home.”

Carvajal said the BOP could not mandate staff to test.

“We can offer the testing,” said Carvajal. “People don’t want to take it. We can’t make them.”

Watching the hearing from his sickbed, where he was cramped with body aches from COVID-19, Francis Bailey, a correctional officer at Loretto, was furious.

“I can tell you now that FCI Loretto has never been offered testing,” said Bailey, president of its union, American Federation of Government Employees Local 3951. “I have requested it multiple times, and have been told that it is a liability issue.”

Dozens of Bailey’s fellow officers have gotten sick. One staff member brought the disease home to his pregnant wife, Bailey said.

The Bureau of Prisons declined to answer specific questions about the outbreak at Loretto. Instead, the agency sent NBC News a lengthy email outlining the measures it has taken including curbing movement in and between facilities, quarantine measures, and releasing prisoners to serve out their time in home confinement.

“The efficacy of the BOP's mitigation strategies can be seen in the very low number of hospitalized inmates,” a spokesman wrote.

But to Bailey and the prisoners inside, that’s little comfort.

“In the 12 years in corrections, this is probably the scariest thing I’ve had to deal with, and the most stressful thing,” said Bailey. “We would like the Bureau to acknowledge that there’s a problem and that they’re doing something wrong.”

“Somebody Dropped the Ball”

The first big outbreak at Loretto came this summer, on the tail end of a wave that hit a lot of rural counties. The pandemic had been circulating in the Bureau of Prisons for months, but at Loretto, staff still scrambled.

After a prisoner who asked to be identified as LG tested positive, he was moved into a unit with more than 30 other infected men, he told NBC News in an email, asking to use his initials for fear of retribution. They had to share a urinal and two toilets, he said. Half a day after they were moved, they were given just two blankets apiece, according to LG and another prisoner. No bed rolls. No extra underwear. They were told, he said, that “somebody dropped the ball.” Throughout his 16 days there, LG said he received two rolls of toilet paper.

Colise Harmon, who also was quarantined with the virus this summer, said prisoners went more than 11 days without laundry service or cleaning supplies to disinfect their dorm, where sewage seeped across the floors.

“Third world countries treat their incarcerated better than this,” Harmon wrote in an email. Both Harmon and LG had their petitions for compassionate release denied.

In memos issued early in the pandemic, U.S. Attorney General William Barr urged the Bureau of Prisons to take measures to release vulnerable prisoners.

But data compiled by the Marshall Project show federal prison wardens denied or ignored more than 98 percent of compassionate release requests. At least two prisoners at Loretto received letters saying that because they did not have a terminal disease with less than 18 months to live, and could still perform daily tasks, they did not qualify.

Barr also directed the Bureau to “prioritize home confinement,” allowing prisoners to serve their time at home, under supervision. About 18,000 people have been released to home confinement. which prioritizes nonviolent, medically-vulnerable inmates who have served at least half their time, or are within 18 months of their release date. But advocates and prisoners said the agency has denied many prisoners who meet the criteria, including men at the low-security Loretto facility.

In early fall, as cases both inside and outside Loretto dropped, the prison began to lift some restrictions. Men were able to receive family visits after they had been suspended for months, according to prisoners and staff Loretto accepted new prisoners from the U.S. Marshals.

Staff were allowed to take paid leave if they were infected, but expected to come to work even if they had been exposed, said Bailey. As long as they passed a temperature check on arrival, they were considered cleared to work.

By November, Covid-19 was back. Late that month, Nelson Martinez said officials came and tested every man in Central 2, the dorm the 48-year-old with diabetes and asthma was living, still recovering from cataract surgery.

When he tested negative, Martinez said officers told him he’d be moved. Martinez recalled that another man who also tested negative was showing symptoms--he said he couldn’t smell or taste, and asked to be left behind with the positives.

The man wanted to help stop the spread, Martinez said. But he was moved with Martinez into the negative dorm anyway. The next day, Martinez tested positive. He said he was moved again.

Across the prison, men were shuffled from place to place in what prisoners and families describe as a poorly-considered effort to control the spread.

“They are herding the virus around the building,” said Harmon.

Wyatt, the prisoner with heart disease, was transferred to Loretto in late November from a medical prison in North Carolina. When he arrived, he was placed in a dorm with another man who was “clearly positive,” said Tyler, his fiancee. Within weeks of arriving, he had no taste or smell, his head was pounding and he was rushed into a dorm for the positive men.

By the middle of December, the number of active Covid-19 cases had soared to over 620, according to the Bureau of Prisons’ statistics. Staff and prisoners said they believed it was higher. Bailey, the union president, said that since March, all but about 90 of Loretto's 856 prisoners have contracted the virus.

They had so many positives that the efforts to quarantine left prisoners scattered across the facility, according to the accounts of prisoners and their families. There were sick men on cots in the gym, the visiting room, and, according to one account, on a block without windows or ventilation, where Harmon said plumbing is so bad that feces “just starts erupting out of the toilet.”

As hot spots spread into a full outbreak, Tyler rallied with other family members in a Facebook group. They called legislators. They flooded the warden’s office with email.

Anthony Serrano, who suffers from high blood pressure, pre-diabetes and severe sleep apnea, was also turned down for compassionate release by both the Bureau and a federal court.

U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said Serrano had made efforts to educate himself and remained a dedicated father, but said he had only served a third of his lengthy sentence. ""I am not convinced that Serrano is sufficiently reformed,” Hellerstein wrote.

On Dec. 7, Serrano, too, contracted the coronavirus.

As the outbreak spread, Serrano’s fiancé took to Twitter, furiously tagging U.S. Senator Cory Booker, actress Rosario Dawson, President Donald Trump. If she couldn’t get Serrano out, she said she needed someone with influence to take a look at what was happening inside.

“I find myself crying now and then, but I try to keep it together when I talk to him,” said the woman, who has been speaking out under the assumed name Liz Martinez to avoid retaliation. “I can’t be falling apart.”

For most of the men at Loretto, the only hope of getting free is to convince the judge who sentenced them that they should get early release. The chances are slim, and many have been turned down by judges who say they either have not served enough time, or still pose a risk to the community.

But 16 years after being sentenced on drug conspiracy charges, Martinez, the man recovering from cataracts, was granted compassionate release. He walked out of the prison on Dec. 4, squinting his still-healing eyes at his mother, who wrapped her arms tightly around her 48-year-old son.

Martinez didn’t escape Covid-19, but he’s recovering at home, where his mother can ply him with food and love. But even with Nelson out, the Martinez family hasn’t escaped the outbreak in the BOP.

Martinez’s younger brother Jeffery, one of his co-defendants in the 2005 case, is among nearly 100 prisoners hit by a coronavirus outbreak at FCI Danbury, in Connecticut.

“My other son is still there,” said Nelson’s mother Liana Martinez. “He’s scared.”",MSNBC,"['zone', 'release', 'loretto', 'outbreak', 'covid19', 'men', 'ravaged', 'prison', 'martinez', 'federal', 'prisoners', 'early', 'bureau', 'freed', 'paul', 'manafort', 'war', 'covid']",0

2020-12-19 04:11:03+00:00,48,"WASHINGTON — Congress hit a new stumbling block that prevented leaders from approving a coronavirus aid deal on Friday, as lawmakers raced to avert a government shutdown at midnight.

The House voted 320-60 to pass a two-day funding extension, sending it to the Senate, which quickly approved it by a voice vote.

President Donald Trump signed the stopgap bill Friday night, setting up a new Sunday midnight deadline and give negotiators the weekend to sort out their differences on Covid relief.

""Alas, we are not there yet,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., calling the bill an effort to prevent a ""pointless lapse"" in funding while negotiations continued.

Congressional leaders settled on a $900 billion framework midweek that was expected to include a $300 federal unemployment bonus, a new round of direct payments, small business funding and money to distribute Covid-19 vaccines.

But a new roadblock emerged as Democrats on Friday accused Republicans, led by Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, of seeking to hamstring the incoming Biden administration by cutting off Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities created by the CARES Act to protect the fragile economy.

Democrats want to extend that authority into the new year, describing it as an important tool to respond to an economic crisis.

A senior Democratic aide said ""an agreement was in sight to deliver aid to the American people until Sen. Toomey and Republicans inserted an eleventh-hour purely political, unrelated provision to tie Biden’s hands and risk throwing the economy into a tailspin.""

Toomey called the issue his ""top priority"" in a phone call with reporters, arguing that the Fed lending programs were designed to be ""temporary"" and ""cease operations no later than the end of 2020.""

""We were in a very, very dangerous moment with respect to financial markets that were not functioning. And so these programs were stood up to revive these private markets and they were remarkably successful in that purpose,"" he said, describing his stance as ""a Republican Senate consensus position.""

Democrats say the language sought by Toomey is overly broad and restrictive.

""After weeks of refusing to acknowledge Biden's victory, some Republicans have now decided that sabotaging his presidency is more important than helping our economy recover by insisting that any Covid relief legislation also restrict the ability of the Federal Reserve and the new Administration to help states, cities, and American businesses next year,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a statement.

Earlier Friday, McConnell, R-Ky., sounded upbeat.

""I am even more optimistic now than I was last night that a bipartisan, bicameral framework for a major rescue package is close at hand,"" McConnell said. ""Like I’ve said, the Senate will be right here until an agreement is passed, whenever that may be.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and McConnell each said this week they planned to combine a Covid-19 relief package with a must-pass $1.4 trillion funding bill that appropriators have negotiated in recent weeks.

The Toomey language continued to be a hurdle into Friday afternoon.

Pelosi and McConnell spoke around 1 p.m. and agreed that staff should wrap up the agreement before 5 p.m., according to two sources familiar with the matter.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., adjourned the chamber until 5 p.m., and when a deal still had not materialized, Democrats went ahead and put the two-day bill up for a vote.

Hoyer adjourned the House until Sunday at noon, making clear there would be no votes on Saturday even if a Covid relief deal is reached quickly.

The government funding bill is ready to pass, aides close to the talks said. The holdup is Covid relief.

Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday that lawmakers are ""anxious to get this done.""

""There’s some always last minute stuff that pops up. But it's coming together. It's just taking time,"" Thune told reporters, adding that Fed lending authority remains a hurdle.

""We have a lot of our members who believe that was for a temporary time that needs to be ended,"" he said. ""And the Dems see it differently. I hope we can find a way to finesse that and get a deal.""",MSNBC,"['bill', 'relief', 'funding', 'stumbles', 'congress', 'senate', 'passes', 'avert', 'deal', 'toomey', 'republicans', 'twoday', 'sen', 'mcconnell', 'covid', 'shutdown']",0

Thursday was another record-breaking day in reported Covid-19 cases in the United States, the latest milestone in a month that has seen cases and deaths climb to unprecedented levels.

There were 243,645 Covid-19 cases reported across the nation on Thursday, according to NBC News' count of reports, and 3,288 deaths. On Wednesday, the U.S. broke daily records for both cases and deaths reported. Before that, the highest numbers for both reported in a day was on Dec. 10.

The United States is the first country to greenlight use of Moderna's vaccine, which was developed in part with the National Institutes of Health.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""This is another crucial step in the fight against the global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States every day,"" FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said during a media briefing late Friday.

Indeed, the news was met with optimism. ""I've never been more hopeful that we will eventually turn the corner on this pandemic,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. ""I encourage all Americans to get vaccinated when their groups are called, and I look forward to doing so when it is my turn.""

Nearly 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been earmarked for distribution and are expected to be shipped to 3,285 locations across the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, which partially funded the Moderna work.

In a statement issued Friday, Moderna said that about 20 million doses of its vaccine will be delivered to the U.S. government by the end of this year. ""The Company expects to have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first quarter of 2021, with 85-100 million of those available in the U.S.,"" the statement read.

Moderna's vaccine has been shown to be safe and highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness, according to documents released Tuesday. The data also suggest that the vaccine may reduce the virus's spread by preventing infections, though more data are needed to fully understand that finding.

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, called the finding ""intriguing"" during the Friday briefing, adding that the NIH is considering studying this further.

The FDA authorization comes the day after an advisory committee to the agency recommended the vaccine in a near unanimous vote. Of 21 voting members, 20 voted in favor of authorization.

One person, Dr. Michael Kurilla, an infectious disease expert with the National Institutes of Health, abstained from voting because he said he felt the question on which the committee voted, ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?"" was too broad, and should have been targeted toward people at highest risk for severe Covid-19.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Last week, the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for those ages 16 and older. Nearly 3 million doses of that vaccine were on target for delivery this week to health care workers and people in long-term care facilities. A second batch of doses has been reserved for the second shot, administered 21 days after the first.

Moderna's vaccine is also given in two doses, but 28 days apart. Clinical trials showed the vaccine was 94 percent effective in preventing symptomatic illness within two weeks after the second dose. Pfizer's has been shown to be similarly effective.

Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine does not need to be stored at ultracold temperatures. Rather, the vaccine can be stored at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit — the temperature of a standard refrigerator — for up to 30 days, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

One potentially thorny issue is the risk of severe allergic reactions. The FDA's Marks said Friday night that the agency was looking into ""roughly five"" allergic reactions linked to the Pfizer vaccine. One of those reactions was reported in a health care worker in Alaska who needed to be hospitalized.

While no such reactions were reported during Moderna's clinical trials, the FDA is advising people who have had severe reactions to vaccines in the past to forgo the vaccine at this time, until more information is available.

One potential — but as yet unproven — culprit for the allergic reactions is polyethylene glycol, which is present in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Marks said, adding any ideas about what could be leading to allergic reactions remain speculative.

No long-term problems have been reported.

2020-12-18 20:02:08+00:00,49,"At least one federal judge in Georgia has ruled against landlords who argue the CDC ban was unconstitutional. But that hasn't stopped Kinsey from continuing to evict based on it. On Dec. 1, she ruled against another local renter, using the same rationale.

Kinsey’s clerk said the judge would not comment on the cases, citing court policy.

The CDC’s eviction moratorium was supposed to protect renters in all 50 states through the end of the year. Keeping Covid-affected renters in their apartments, the CDC said, would reduce the potential for virus transmission likely to occur as displaced people were forced to move in with family or friends or into homeless shelters.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

But nationwide adherence to the moratorium has been spotty, housing experts say. Some judges, like Kinsey, are rejecting the moratorium outright, while others are evicting based on landlord-friendly state regulations or disputed claims about tenants violating their leases.

Evictions processed while the moratorium is still in place are a preview of what some experts predict will be a wave of homelessness when the CDC moratorium expires on Dec. 31. Access to Congressional funds earmarked for rental assistance also ends then, programs that have helped landlords as well as renters.

“If policymakers don’t intervene, we are facing the very real possibility of tens of millions of people losing their homes this winter,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in an email. “The consequences will be catastrophic — for children, families, communities and our country’s ability to contain the pandemic.”

‘They broke a lot of my things’

Apart from the temporary CDC moratorium, the U.S. has no federal eviction policy and each state has different rules for landlords and tenants. In Ohio, for example, landlords can proceed with evictions if a tenant is just one day late with the rent.

Some states have implemented their own eviction bars. But at least seven states — Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming — have never put such protections in place. All are Republican-controlled and most have resisted many Covid-19 measures.

Landlords in an array of states have filed lawsuits challenging the CDC moratorium. One, filed in federal court in the northern district of Ohio, contends that the eviction ban “represents a sweeping assumption of power by an administrative agency that it simply does not possess.” The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics filed briefs in support of the CDC’s order and against the landlords. The judge hearing the case is expected to rule soon.

The homeless wave is already starting to build in some places, housing advocates say. Benjamin Horne, advocacy director for the Legal Aid Society of Columbus, Ohio, reported a significant increase in eviction filings in the most recent week in his area — over 500 compared with at most 300 previously.

Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, told NBC News in an email that Springfield, a small Ohio city near Dayton, has seen its homeless population explode in recent weeks. “Demand for shelter is now nearly seven times what it was at the beginning of the pandemic,” Faith said of Springfield.

Amanda Frank, 39, of Wooster, Ohio, near Akron, became homeless in November when a judge ruled against her in an eviction proceeding. For a year, Frank had rented a townhouse from a local contractor and builder, Sommer & Swartzentruber, where she lived with her boyfriend and 17-year-old daughter.

Frank had fallen behind on her rent after her boyfriend was laid off due to Covid-19, she said. Although she received rental assistance from a local church and ultimately paid her landlord what she owed, the judge hearing her case sided with the landlord, saying she’d been able to pay the rent but had not done so on time.

Working for a house-cleaning company, Frank had become the sole breadwinner and she provided documentation to the court that she’d been affected by Covid-19 as required by the CDC moratorium, she said.

She was given a week to get out and at 3 p.m. on the last day, as she was packing, the landlord’s representatives arrived and started tossing her belongings into the yard.

“They broke a lot of my things by throwing them out the door,” said Frank, who has never been evicted before. “That was the most devastating thing I’ve ever had to go through.”

Frank’s landlord, Gerald Swartzentruber, did not return a phone call and email seeking comment about Frank’s eviction.

Local charitable organizations have helped Frank collect rent money for a new home but every landlord she’s applied to has turned her down because of the eviction on her record, she said. This is the typical experience of renters with evictions in their histories, housing experts said.

For now, Frank and her boyfriend are living in their car. Her daughter has gone to live with Frank’s ex-husband.

$5,400 each in unpaid rent

Frank is one of many who have fallen behind on rent amid the pandemic. The portion of tenants owing back rent has roughly tripled during the pandemic, federal census surveys show.

In both 2013 and 2017, the two most recent years for which pre-pandemic data on delinquent rent are available, roughly 6 percent of renters were unable to pay all or part of their rent, according to the surveys. But the most recent survey tracking the pandemic’s impact on households, released yesterday, identified an estimated 18 percent of households behind on rent payments.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia says renter households experiencing job loss because of Covid-19 currently owe an estimated $7.2 billion in unpaid rent, or $5,400 each. Among the hardest hit are female renters and households of color, the report noted.

The bipartisan stimulus package under consideration by Congress would provide $25 billion in emergency rental assistance and extend the CDC moratorium through Jan. 31, 2021.

Those funds would be welcomed as many current rental assistance programs are running out of time and money.

There are more than 518 of these programs, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and of the more than $4.2 billion allotted to them, some $364 million of coronavirus relief funds that were supposed to cover missing rent payments remain unspent. If it is not allocated, that money will be sent back to the U.S. Treasury at the end of the year.

2020-12-18 13:35:44+00:00,8,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence received the Covid-19 vaccine in a televised appearance Friday morning in an effort to promote its safety and boost public confidence in its effectiveness.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was also given to his wife, Karen Pence, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the the White House by a medical team from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

""I didn't feel a thing. Well done,"" Pence said in remarks after receiving the shot in his left arm.

Pence called it a ""medical miracle,"" saying that the average vaccine usually takes eight to 12 years to develop, manufacture and distribute. ""But we're on track here in the United States to administer millions of doses to the American people in less than one year. It is a miracle indeed,"" he said.

""Karen and I wanted to step forward and take this vaccine to assure the American people that while we cut red tape, we cut no corners,"" Pence added. ""Thanks to the great work at the National Institutes of Health, and the great and careful work of the FDA and the leadership of our president and Operation Warp Speed, the American people can be confident we have one, and, perhaps within hours, two safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for you and for your family.""

Doctors advised the Pences and Adams that they must return in 21 days for the second dose of the vaccine and that they may feel some soreness around the injection site.

The White House said in a statement this week that, by getting the shot, Pence, who leads the coronavirus task force, was hoping to ""promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people.""

It's unclear if President Donald Trump will receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Trump has said he looks forward to getting the vaccine ""at the appropriate time."" He and first lady Melania Trump recovered from Covid-19 in October.

President-elect Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, will both receive the vaccine on Monday, according to Jen Psaki, incoming White House press secretary. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, are expected to receive it the following week.

""I don't want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,"" Biden told reporters.

Pence is receiving the vaccine just days after the first shipments were delivered to health care facilities across the country and given to front-line workers and nursing home residents. It also comes as the U.S. has set records this week for daily coronavirus cases and deaths.

The disease caused by the coronavirus has killed more than 300,000 people and infected more than 16.3 million in the U.S. alone.

2020-12-18 08:01:02+00:00,38,"A health care worker at the Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska, developed a severe allergic reaction shortly after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine Tuesday evening, and had to be hospitalized overnight.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

During a media briefing Wednesday, health officials said the middle-aged woman had no history of allergies and had never experienced anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction.

Bartlett Regional Hospital officials said all 96 of its workers who received the vaccine Tuesday were observed for 30 minutes after the shot. The woman starting feeling flushed about 10 minutes into that observation period, and took Benadryl, an antihistamine.

However, her symptoms progressed to an elevated heart rate and shortness of breath, and was sent to the hospital's emergency department.

""She had a red, flushed rash over her face and torso,"" Dr. Lindy Jones, the emergency physician who treated her, said during the briefing Wednesday. ""I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction."" Jones gave her an emergency injection of epinephrine.

Her symptoms abated for a short time, but then re-emerged. She was put on intravenous epinephrine, and moved to the hospital's intensive care unit where she remained overnight. Jones said the woman did not necessarily require ICU resources, but added, ""we are a small little hospital here, so if we are concerned about anyone, we put them in the ICU.""

As of Wednesday morning, the woman was off all medications, and was expected to be discharged Wednesday evening.

Pfizer said in a statement that the company is ""working with local health authorities to assess"" the reaction that occurred in Alaska, and will ""closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed.""

That hospital officials were able to identify the reaction and treat it appropriately ""demonstrates that the vaccine safety monitoring system is strong and robust for handling the pandemic response,"" Dr. Jay Butler, head of the Covid-19 response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.

Butler said the Alaska case is the only allergic reaction to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reported in the United States so far.

Two health care workers in the United Kingdom experienced similar allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine last week. After the Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine for emergency use in the U.S., the regulatory agency said people with a history of allergic reactions should speak with their doctors about the vaccine, but added there was not enough evidence to suggest the majority of people with allergies steer clear of the shots.

Allergic reactions to vaccines or other medications are rare, but do occur. Any facility qualified to administer vaccines is equipped with emergency epinephrine (known to many as an EpiPen) in the event of severe reactions.

Despite her reaction and subsequent hospitalization, health officials said, the health care worker ""was enthusiastic that she got the vaccine,"" specifically about the benefits it might eventually offer her.

Still, Butler said the woman will be advised to skip the second dose.

2020-12-18 02:02:04+00:00,77,"At least one federal judge in Georgia has ruled against landlords who argue the CDC ban was unconstitutional. But that hasn't stopped Kinsey from continuing to evict based on it. On Dec. 1, she ruled against another local renter, using the same rationale.

Kinsey’s clerk said the judge would not comment on the cases, citing court policy.

The CDC’s eviction moratorium was supposed to protect renters in all 50 states through the end of the year. Keeping Covid-affected renters in their apartments, the CDC said, would reduce the potential for virus transmission likely to occur as displaced people were forced to move in with family or friends or into homeless shelters.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

But nationwide adherence to the moratorium has been spotty, housing experts say. Some judges, like Kinsey, are rejecting the moratorium outright, while others are evicting based on landlord-friendly state regulations or disputed claims about tenants violating their leases.

Evictions processed while the moratorium is still in place are a preview of what some experts predict will be a wave of homelessness when the CDC moratorium expires on Dec. 31. Access to Congressional funds earmarked for rental assistance also ends then, programs that have helped landlords as well as renters.

“If policymakers don’t intervene, we are facing the very real possibility of tens of millions of people losing their homes this winter,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in an email. “The consequences will be catastrophic — for children, families, communities and our country’s ability to contain the pandemic.”

‘They broke a lot of my things’

Apart from the temporary CDC moratorium, the U.S. has no federal eviction policy and each state has different rules for landlords and tenants. In Ohio, for example, landlords can proceed with evictions if a tenant is just one day late with the rent.

Some states have implemented their own eviction bars. But at least seven states — Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming — have never put such protections in place. All are Republican-controlled and most have resisted many Covid-19 measures.

Landlords in an array of states have filed lawsuits challenging the CDC moratorium. One, filed in federal court in the northern district of Ohio, contends that the eviction ban “represents a sweeping assumption of power by an administrative agency that it simply does not possess.” The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics filed briefs in support of the CDC’s order and against the landlords. The judge hearing the case is expected to rule soon.

The homeless wave is already starting to build in some places, housing advocates say. Benjamin Horne, advocacy director for the Legal Aid Society of Columbus, Ohio, reported a significant increase in eviction filings in the most recent week in his area — over 500 compared with at most 300 previously.

Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, told NBC News in an email that Springfield, a small Ohio city near Dayton, has seen its homeless population explode in recent weeks. “Demand for shelter is now nearly seven times what it was at the beginning of the pandemic,” Faith said of Springfield.

Amanda Frank, 39, of Wooster, Ohio, near Akron, became homeless in November when a judge ruled against her in an eviction proceeding. For a year, Frank had rented a townhouse from a local contractor and builder, Sommer & Swartzentruber, where she lived with her boyfriend and 17-year-old daughter.

Frank had fallen behind on her rent after her boyfriend was laid off due to Covid-19, she said. Although she received rental assistance from a local church and ultimately paid her landlord what she owed, the judge hearing her case sided with the landlord, saying she’d been able to pay the rent but had not done so on time.

Working for a house-cleaning company, Frank had become the sole breadwinner and she provided documentation to the court that she’d been affected by Covid-19 as required by the CDC moratorium, she said.

She was given a week to get out and at 3 p.m. on the last day, as she was packing, the landlord’s representatives arrived and started tossing her belongings into the yard.

“They broke a lot of my things by throwing them out the door,” said Frank, who has never been evicted before. “That was the most devastating thing I’ve ever had to go through.”

Frank’s landlord, Gerald Swartzentruber, did not return a phone call and email seeking comment about Frank’s eviction.

Local charitable organizations have helped Frank collect rent money for a new home but every landlord she’s applied to has turned her down because of the eviction on her record, she said. This is the typical experience of renters with evictions in their histories, housing experts said.

For now, Frank and her boyfriend are living in their car. Her daughter has gone to live with Frank’s ex-husband.

$5,400 each in unpaid rent

Frank is one of many who have fallen behind on rent amid the pandemic. The portion of tenants owing back rent has roughly tripled during the pandemic, federal census surveys show.

In both 2013 and 2017, the two most recent years for which pre-pandemic data on delinquent rent are available, roughly 6 percent of renters were unable to pay all or part of their rent, according to the surveys. But the most recent survey tracking the pandemic’s impact on households, released yesterday, identified an estimated 18 percent of households behind on rent payments.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia says renter households experiencing job loss because of Covid-19 currently owe an estimated $7.2 billion in unpaid rent, or $5,400 each. Among the hardest hit are female renters and households of color, the report noted.

The bipartisan stimulus package under consideration by Congress would provide $25 billion in emergency rental assistance and extend the CDC moratorium through Jan. 31, 2021.

Those funds would be welcomed as many current rental assistance programs are running out of time and money.

There are more than 518 of these programs, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and of the more than $4.2 billion allotted to them, some $364 million of coronavirus relief funds that were supposed to cover missing rent payments remain unspent. If it is not allocated, that money will be sent back to the U.S. Treasury at the end of the year.

2020-12-17 22:15:20+00:00,63,"An independent panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration overwhelmingly recommended that the agency authorize Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Thursday, bringing the United States one step closer to adding a second vaccine to its toolkit in fighting the pandemic.

Members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted 20 to 0 in favor of recommending authorization, with one abstention.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The FDA is expected to agree with the committee's recommendation, and an emergency use authorization could come as soon as Thursday evening or Friday.

Acting chair of the advisory group, Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, called Moderna's work a ""remarkable achievement.""

""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, I strongly support it because the benefits outweigh its risks,"" said Dr. Melinda Wharton, director of the Immunization Services Division in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dr. Michael Kurilla, an infectious disease expert with the National Institutes of Health, was the sole member to abstain from the vote. He said he felt the question on which the committee voted, ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?"" was too broad.

""I'm not convinced that for all of those age groups the benefits do actually outweigh the risks,"" Kurilla said. ""And I would prefer to see it more targeted towards people at high risk of serious and life-threatening Covid disease.""

On MSNBC earlier Thursday, Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease expert at Boston University School of Medicine, called it a ""historic day,"" and said that the presumed addition of two other vaccines in Phase 3 clinical trials, from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, ""will ensure that more Americans will get shots in their arms."" Results from those trials are expected in early 2021.

Moderna developed the vaccine with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The company also received funding for the research and development from Operation Warp Speed.

If authorized, the vaccine would be for adults, 18 and older.

Last week, the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for those age 16 and above. Nearly 3 million doses of that vaccine were on target for delivery this week to health care workers and people in long-term care facilities. A second batch of doses has been reserved for the second shot, administered 21 days after the first.

Moderna's vaccine is also given in two doses, but 28 days apart. Clinical trials showed the vaccine was 94 percent effective in preventing symptomatic illness within two weeks after the second dose. Pfizer's has been shown to be similarly effective.

The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna both work in the same way, using tiny snippets of genetic code called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the immune system into producing antibodies to the coronavirus, without using bits of the virus itself.

These are the first such vaccines to be authorized for use.

Any physical reaction to the shots — from minor redness at the injection site to life-threatening anaphylaxis — will be followed closely. This is largely because of four known cases of severe allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine.

Two health care workers in Alaska developed allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer shot this week, and severe allergic reactions were also reported in two health care workers in the United Kingdom last week.

The events remain under investigation, and it is unclear whether there is a single component or ingredient in the Pfizer vaccine that could be causing the reactions.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

During the advisory committee meeting Thursday, representatives from Moderna said that among the more than 30,000 clinical trial participants, there were no cases of anaphylaxis that appeared to be related. (One participant developed anaphylaxis 63 days after getting the second dose. The reaction usually occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen.)

There was also discussion about whether people who have recently had cosmetic fillers could be at greater risk for temporary facial swelling after the shot.

Three people in Moderna's clinical trials who developed swelling in the face also had fillers, either in their cheeks or lips. Those procedures had been completed between two weeks and six months before vaccination.

Other milder side effects were indeed reported among those who received the Moderna vaccine, especially after the second dose.

The most common were pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in the injection area. Headache, fatigue, weakness, chills, nausea and joint pain were also reported. Bell's palsy, a facial paralysis, was reported in four study participants. Three were in the vaccine group, and one had received the placebo.

The advisory committee also addressed the potential impact of giving study participants who got the placebo the real vaccine so they, too, can benefit.

There are pros and cons to such a decision. The highest quality scientific data relies on analyzing the differences between those who got the placebo and those who got the actual vaccine or other medication.

But many ethicists believe the placebo volunteers deserve such protection.

Both Pfizer and Moderna have indicated they will offer placebo recipients the real vaccine.

2020-12-17 16:21:02+00:00,192,"The first sign of trouble came in April, as the United States struggled with the first wave of coronavirus infections. Among the White House's moves was hiring Michael Caputo, a notorious Republican political operative and a Roger Stone protégé, for a leadership role at the Department of Health and Human Services.

Caputo had no meaningful background in health care, science, or responding to public-health crises, but on Team Trump, qualifications have never been much of a priority.

Once at HHS, Caputo added some officials of his own to the administration's operation, including Paul Alexander, a part-time professor at a Canadian university, who was there to serve as Caputo's science adviser. Why Alexander was brought into the operation has never been altogether clear -- there were plenty of qualified people at HHS who would've been happy to advice Caputo on scientific matters -- but Alexander was nevertheless given a prominent role at the CDC, where he tried to force scientific reports to comport with Donald Trump's election-year messaging.

But as it turns out, that's not all he did. Politico reported yesterday:

A top Trump appointee repeatedly urged top health officials to adopt a ""herd immunity"" approach to Covid-19 and allow millions of Americans to be infected by the virus, according to internal emails obtained by a House watchdog and shared with POLITICO.

""There is no other way, we need to establish herd, and it only comes about allowing the non-high risk groups expose themselves to the virus. PERIOD,"" Alexander wrote in a July email to Caputo and six other senior officials. He added, ""Infants, kids, teens, young people, young adults, middle aged with no conditions etc. have zero to little risk....so we use them to develop herd...we want them infected.""

When books are written on the Trump administration's catastrophic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, expect one of them to be titled, We Want Them Infected.

Stepping back, the larger context is important. While a political appointee at the CDC was advocating in support of more coronavirus infections, Donald Trump was listening almost exclusively to Scott Atlas, a radiologist he saw on Fox News, who was also advising the president on the merits of the crackpot pandemic strategy known as ""herd immunity,"" in which officials allow the virus to spread and infect much of the population.

And while the public can take some solace in the fact that both Alexander and Atlas are no longer working in the administration, the far more discouraging fact is that they had considerable success in steering the direction of Team Trump's pandemic response.

Indeed, it was just last week when the outgoing president hosted a bizarre White House event at which Trump declared, ""[Y]ou do have an immunity. You develop immunity over a period of time, and I hear we're close to 15 percent. I'm hearing that, and that is terrific. That's a very powerful vaccine in itself. And just tremendous progress has been made.""

As is too often the case, the Republican flubbed the relevant details -- there were more than 15 million confirmed cases in the United States at the time, but that didn't mean that 15 percent of the population had tested positive -- but more important was the fact that the outgoing president described widespread infections as being the equivalent of a ""vaccine"" (they're not) and characterized infections as ""terrific.""

Or put another way, Trump's misguided perspective is tragically in line with the misguided emails Paul Alexander sent over the summer.",MSNBC,"['infections', 'virus', 'immunity', 'president', 'appointee', 'trumps', 'officials', 'pandemic', 'infected', 'alexander', 'caputo', 'cdc', 'trump']",0

“They broke a lot of my things by throwing them out the door,” said Frank, who has never been evicted before. “That was the most devastating thing I’ve ever had to go through.”

Frank’s landlord, Gerald Swartzentruber, did not return a phone call and email seeking comment about Frank’s eviction.

Local charitable organizations have helped Frank collect rent money for a new home but every landlord she’s applied to has turned her down because of the eviction on her record, she said. This is the typical experience of renters with evictions in their histories, housing experts said.

For now, Frank and her boyfriend are living in their car. Her daughter has gone to live with Frank’s ex-husband.

$5,400 each in unpaid rent

Frank is one of many who have fallen behind on rent amid the pandemic. The portion of tenants owing back rent has roughly tripled during the pandemic, federal census surveys show.

In both 2013 and 2017, the two most recent years for which pre-pandemic data on delinquent rent are available, roughly 6 percent of renters were unable to pay all or part of their rent, according to the surveys. But the most recent survey tracking the pandemic’s impact on households, released yesterday, identified an estimated 18 percent of households behind on rent payments.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia says renter households experiencing job loss because of Covid-19 currently owe an estimated $7.2 billion in unpaid rent, or $5,400 each. Among the hardest hit are female renters and households of color, the report noted.

The bipartisan stimulus package under consideration by Congress would provide $25 billion in emergency rental assistance and extend the CDC moratorium through Jan. 31, 2021.

Those funds would be welcomed as many current rental assistance programs are running out of time and money.

There are more than 518 of these programs, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and of the more than $4.2 billion allotted to them, some $364 million of coronavirus relief funds that were supposed to cover missing rent payments remain unspent. If it is not allocated, that money will be sent back to the U.S. Treasury at the end of the year.

Many programs around the country have been overwhelmed by demand, some lacking the staff to distribute funds quickly enough, the coalition said; others depleted funding within hours of opening. More than 150 programs have closed because demand surpassed available resources.",MSNBC,"['evictions', 'frank', 'moratorium', 'street', 'banned', 'rent', 'housing', 'renters', 'landlords', 'ohio', 'eviction', 'programs', 'affected', 'thrown', 'cdc', 'tenants', 'covid']",0

2020-12-17 13:41:07+00:00,29,"Initial weekly jobless claims rose to 885,000 reflecting the escalating economic toll of cities and states struggling to contain surging Covid-19 numbers — and prompting starkly worded calls for Congress to pass another round of fiscal stimulus to help keep millions of Americans financially solvent.

The latest number, an increase of 23,000 from the previous week's revised levels, does little to allay economists’ concerns about the combination of renewed business closures and lockdowns, weakening retail spending and the looming cutoff of federal financial support programs for borrowers and unemployed workers.

It was also higher than expected. The average estimate of economists polled by FactSet had anticipated initial claims falling to 790,000 and seeing 5.7 million continuing claims. November’s monthly employment report, released in early December, showed that employers added just 245,000 jobs last month — a sharp slowdown that also took economists by surprise.

Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, said the current trajectory is clear — and alarming. ""The recovery is weakening as we head into a rough winter. As the pandemic surges, employers are again furloughing or laying off workers as states impose new restrictions and consumer demand dries up,” he said.

As has been the case for the past several weeks, economists said the weekly jobless figures don’t reflect the full scope of the labor market’s troubles, since many workers have exhausted their state unemployment benefits and have cycled into expanded federal unemployment aid, assistance that expires at the end of the year. Economists also warn that a pullback in spending is all but inevitable as forbearance from debt and eviction moratoriums also end in a few weeks. One recent survey found that more than four in 10 people who lost income because of Covid-19 have not recovered their previous earning power.

“The economy requires forward momentum to stay healthy, and letting it roll to a stop hurts everyone,” said Josh Wright, founder and chief economist at economics consulting firm Wrightside Advisors.

This contraction in consumer activity appears to be already taking place. Retail sales data released Wednesday revealed a pullback in people’s willingness to spend, with Commerce Department data showing a 1.1 percent decline in November.

“Nervous Americans are also becoming more cautious in their travel and spending, fearful of getting sick,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

Zandi said this was the most recent signal to lawmakers that delaying further fiscal aid would have systemic economic consequences. “Without additional fiscal relief from lawmakers, it is likely employment will decline and unemployment will increase in the next few months,” he predicted.

Although the stock market has been buoyed by positive vaccine news, the reality on the ground is much grimmer for workers and small businesses, said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation.

“The pain will be lasting if Congress does not re-up the value of unemployment aid, both for families and the economy that will suffer from a decline in consumer spending,” he warned.

In addition to the legislative gridlock that has kept the promise of additional support for laid-off Americans and struggling small businesses, Wright also placed some of the blame on Wall Street’s sanguine response to the mounting economic catastrophe on Main Street.

“Politics plays a role, of course, but so does markets' willingness to look past the short-term turbulence,” he said.

2020-12-17 13:31:08+00:00,30,"A health care worker at the Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska, developed a severe allergic reaction shortly after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine Tuesday evening, and had to be hospitalized overnight.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

During a media briefing Wednesday, health officials said the middle-aged woman had no history of allergies and had never experienced anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction.

Bartlett Regional Hospital officials said all 96 of its workers who received the vaccine Tuesday were observed for 30 minutes after the shot. The woman starting feeling flushed about 10 minutes into that observation period, and took Benadryl, an antihistamine.

However, her symptoms progressed to an elevated heart rate and shortness of breath, and was sent to the hospital's emergency department.

""She had a red, flushed rash over her face and torso,"" Dr. Lindy Jones, the emergency physician who treated her, said during the briefing Wednesday. ""I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction."" Jones gave her an emergency injection of epinephrine.

Her symptoms abated for a short time, but then re-emerged. She was put on intravenous epinephrine, and moved to the hospital's intensive care unit where she remained overnight. Jones said the woman did not necessarily require ICU resources, but added, ""we are a small little hospital here, so if we are concerned about anyone, we put them in the ICU.""

As of Wednesday morning, the woman was off all medications, and was expected to be discharged Wednesday evening.

Pfizer said in a statement that the company is ""working with local health authorities to assess"" the reaction that occurred in Alaska, and will ""closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed.""

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

That hospital officials were able to identify the reaction and treat it appropriately ""demonstrates that the vaccine safety monitoring system is strong and robust for handling the pandemic response,"" Dr. Jay Butler, head of the Covid-19 response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.

Butler said the Alaska case is the only allergic reaction to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reported in the United States so far.

Two health care workers in the United Kingdom experienced similar allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine last week. After the Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine for emergency use in the U.S., the regulatory agency said people with a history of allergic reactions should speak with their doctors about the vaccine, but added there was not enough evidence to suggest the majority of people with allergies steer clear of the shots.

Allergic reactions to vaccines or other medications are rare, but do occur. Any facility qualified to administer vaccines is equipped with emergency epinephrine (known to many as an EpiPen) in the event of severe reactions.

Despite her reaction and subsequent hospitalization, health officials said, the health care worker ""was enthusiastic that she got the vaccine,"" specifically about the benefits it might eventually offer her.

Still, Butler said the woman will be advised to skip the second dose.

2020-12-17 13:01:07+00:00,103,"Tyson Foods terminated seven employees from an Iowa pork plant following an independent investigation into allegations that management wagered on how many workers would get infected with Covid-19, the meat processing giant announced on Wednesday.

All of those fired were plant management employees at the facility in Waterloo, Iowa.

“We value our people and expect everyone on the team, especially our leaders, to operate with integrity and care in everything we do,” said Dean Banks, Tyson Foods President and CEO, said in a statement on Wednesday. “The behaviors exhibited by these individuals do not represent the Tyson core values, which is why we took immediate and appropriate action to get to the truth.""

The wagering allegations, which stem from a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of deceased Tyson Foods Inc. employee, Isidro Fernandez, stated that plant management did not do enough to protect employees while Covid-19 rapidly spread through the facility in early April.

According to the suit, 1,000 of 2,800 employees at the Waterloo plant were infected.

The plant manager, according to the lawsuit, ""organized a cash buy-in, winner-take-all betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many employees would test positive for COVID-19.""

Upon learning of the allegations, the company initiated its own investigation headed by former Attorney General Eric Holder and the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to look into a possible wagering ring.

Tyson said Banks and others immediately traveled to Waterloo to meet with plant team members and community leaders ""to reinforce Tyson’s commitment to them and the community."" Banks said he was "" very upset to learn of the behaviors found in the allegations, as we expect our leaders to treat all team members with the highest levels of respect and integrity."" '

Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson visited the Waterloo plant in the spring and said that conditions were so awful that they ""shook"" him ""to the core,"" according to the suit. At that time, plant workers were crowded together and few wore face coverings.

2020-12-17 10:05:05+00:00,38,"French President Emmanuel Macron became the latest world leader to contract coronavirus Thursday, as countries across Europe struggle to suppress a spike in infections in the run-up to Christmas.

The Élysée Palace, Macron's official residence, confirmed the news in a statement that said he was tested as soon as his symptoms appeared. All his planned trips have been cancelled, including a trip to Lebanon.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first Western leader to get the virus in April and spent a week in a London hospital. Other presidents followed, including President Donald Trump who received hospital treatment in October.

Macron will isolate for seven days and continue to work remotely, the according to the Élysée statement.

The French president has led a typically busy schedule in the last past week, putting him in close contact with senior French and European politicians.

On Wednesday, he met Portugal's prime minister, António Costa, for a joint press conference and working lunch at the Élysée. Pictures from the meeting show both men in close contact.

The prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, will isolate for 10 days after meeting with Macron at an event in Paris on Monday, his office said.

Brigitte Macron, the president's wife, is isolating but not experiencing symptoms, her office confirmed in a statement.

Just six days ago Macron, one of the European Union's key figures, was at a European Council meeting in Brussels with the bloc's most senior figures and the leaders of all 26 member states. The Élysée' statement does not say when Macron began experiencing symptoms.

The European Commission said Thursday that its president, Ursula Von Der Leyen would not isolate as a result of Macron's positive test.

France, in common with the rest of Western Europe, has suffered severely during the pandemic with more than 2.4 million cases and almost 60,000 deaths in a country of 67 million people.

Macron announced a strict lockdown in October, with the hope of bringing new daily cases down to 5,000 a day, warning that 400,000 people could die if further measures were not taken.

Data from Oxford University showed that new infections on Wednesday were more than twice that at over 12,000.

Outbreak sickens staffers at county health department in Arizona A county health official in Arizona tested positive for Covid-19 after an apparent outbreak within the department. Dr. Theresa Cullen, the health director for Pima County, tested positive on Tuesday, the county announced Wednesday.

107-year-old Minnesota woman survives Covid-19 A Minnesota centenarian recovered from Covid-19 after contracting the virus in November. Tillie Dybing, who turned 107 over the summer and lives in a nursing home in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, has survived not just one, but two viral pandemics. She was five years old when the 1918 flu pandemic hit her hometown in North Dakota, sickening her parents. “My folks got sick and they were in bed, and I'd run into the bed and my dad said, ‘Can't you find another place to run,’” Dybing told NBC News affiliate KARE. Her family was worried when she contracted Covid-19 in the fall because her age put her at high risk for severe complications from the coronavirus. “We were really concerned and though, ‘well, this is probably it,’” her daughter Susan Berke told KARE. But after two weeks of fatigue and no severe symptoms, Dybing, who also survived uterine cancer at 95, was moved out of quarantine after fully recovering from the virus. “I thought, well, if the time has come that I have to leave, then I will go, but I'm still here,” Dybing told KARE.

FDA authorizes at-home Covid-19 test with prescription The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization on Wednesday to an at-home Covid-19 test that people can use with a prescription. The BinaxNOW Covid-19 Ag Card Home Test, developed by Abbott and eMed, is an antigen test, which is designed to detect fragments of viral proteins that trigger an immune response in the body. For people who are 15 years or older, the test uses a self-collected nasal swab sample that is analyzed through a smartphone app under the supervision of an eMed telehealth provider. For patients younger than 15, the FDA recommends that an adult perform the nasal swab. Test results can be delivered in approximately 20 minutes, according to eMed. The test correctly identified 91.7 percent of positive samples and 100 percent of negative samples in people with symptoms, but Abbott said results from four investigational sites are still being analyzed. The tests will cost $25, and 30 million kits are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2021, with an additional 90 million tests available in the second quarter, according to Abbott. On Tuesday, the FDA authorized a separate at-home Covid-19 test that does not need a prescription. That antigen test, developed by Ellume, will also be available in January. Share this -

Two tech groups say they’ll merge efforts on digital vaccine cards Two groups of technologists said Wednesday they were combining their work to speed up the development of digital vaccine cards, so that people may eventually be able to use a smartphone app to prove they’ve gotten a Covid-19 vaccine. Digital vaccine certificates, or passports, are expected to be in demand next year as a possible requirement for international air travel or in-person gatherings. They would be an electronic version of the paper-based “yellow cards” that have been around for decades, but they’re not a reality yet because of complications around privacy and interoperability. One of the tech groups, the Linux Foundation Public Health, was involved in earlier efforts to roll out pandemic-related apps that alert users when they’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive for the coronavirus. The foundation said it would host the work of the other group, the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, which sprung up this year specifically to work on digital vaccine cards. The two groups plan to work with public health authorities on challenges including the ethics of digital vaccine cards, said Lucy Yang, co-lead of the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative.

Twitter to remove false vaccine conspiracy theory tweets Twitter announced on Wednesday it would remove false or misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines. The move follows similar actions by YouTube in October and Facebook in December. Twitter said it would remove tweets that advance “harmful or misleading narratives,” including false claims about the vaccines that have been “widely debunked about the adverse impacts of receiving vaccinations” and false claims that Covid-19 is “not real or not serious.” The changes will begin until next week, and the company will also ban tweets about global conspiracy theories that suggest vaccines are “used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations.” Conspiracy theories around Covid-19 vaccines have spread unabated on social media since the summer, according to a recent report from First Draft, a global nonprofit organization that researches online misinformation. Vaccine-related conspiracy content accounted for some 10 percent of total vaccine posts, according to the report. Anti-vaccination groups have created organized campaigns since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, some claiming outlandish global conspiracies about secret societies and microchips. The conspiracy theories have gone wildly viral on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, including the repeatedly debunked viral video “Plandemic,” which took off due to coordinated cross-promotion by anti-vaccine groups that existed well before the pandemic.

Direct cash payments under consideration as lawmakers near Covid aid deal WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders and the White House are nearing agreement on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal that will likely include a new round of direct payments, three sources familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday. The emerging package will include enhanced federal jobless benefits, small business funding and money to distribute Covid-19 vaccines. The dollar amount of the stimulus payments has not yet been determined — some aides said it could be $600-per-person while others said it may be higher. Negotiators have not yet settled on an income cap for the direct payments, as was done for the previous round of payments approved in March. The proposal, which is still being finalized and does not have leadership agreement, is not expected to include liability protections for employers or state or local funding, two sticking points in negotiations that prevented Congress from passing meaningful Covid-19 legislation for months.

Operation Warp Speed: Covid-19 vaccine deliveries on track An additional 886 shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine are scheduled for delivery to health care systems nationwide on Thursday and Friday, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, Army Gen. Gustave Perna, said during a media briefing Wednesday. Together with deliveries that have already been distributed, a total of 1,522 shipments of the vaccine will have been shipped in the first week. Each shipment contains about 1,000 doses. Because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, each shipment has a temperature monitoring system. Perna said that while most shipments have gone smoothly, a few boxes sent to California and Alabama arrived at the incorrect temperature. Those boxes were removed from distribution before any shots could be given and replaced. The first doses of the vaccine have gone to health care workers. Several states are now starting vaccinations in long-term care facilities, or will be doing so imminently. They are Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and West Virginia. By Monday, 1,110 long-term care facilities are anticipated to have the vaccine, with thousands more long-term care facilities added daily, Perna said. Share this -

Covid-19 vaccines are being hoarded by rich countries — poor ones are missing out LONDON — Lost among the jubilation of America's vaccine rollout this week is an uncomfortable reality: The world's poorest countries will have to wait months and possibly years to see any doses at all. The U.S., Canada, Britain and the European Union have pre-ordered enough Covid-19 shots to inoculate their populations several times over, subject to regulatory approvals. In this critical game of medicine logistics — where supply is small but demand immediate and universal — campaigners and some officials accuse these wealthy nations of snapping up orders and hoarding more than they need. The People's Vaccine Alliance, a collaboration between several aid groups including Oxfam and Amnesty International, has said that unless drastic measures are taken nearly 70 poor countries will be unable to vaccinate 90 percent of their populations next year.

Restaurants worry bipartisan coronavirus deal is cutting them out The White House and congressional leaders are nearing the finish line on a bipartisan Covid-19 relief deal. But they’re running up against objections from a coalition of restaurants who argue the emerging plan will leave them without enough aid to get through the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic. The Independent Restaurant Coalition, a group of chefs and owners formed to advocate for aid during the pandemic, has been decrying the emerging proposal throughout the last month as insufficient. Instead they’re urging Congress to pass the RESTAURANTS Act, a bipartisan bill that would provide $120 billion in grants to smaller bars and restaurants to make up revenue lost due to coronavirus. On paper, their task should be easy. Lawmakers of both parties are eager to back aid for local bars and restaurants. The bill has 50 sponsors in the Senate and over 200 in the House. Over 160 members sent a letter to House and Senate leaders earlier this month, including other members of leadership like Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, asking for it to be included in relief talks. ""If Mitch McConnell brought this to the floor this would pass easily,” Tom Colicchio, the Top Chef judge, restaurateur, and IRC co-founder, told NBC News.

Retail sales plunged in November, as shoppers stayed home amid rising Covid cases Retail sales fell for a second straight month in November, likely weighed down by raging new Covid-19 infections and decreasing household income, adding to growing signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession. Retail sales dropped 1.1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for October was revised down to show sales falling 0.1 percent instead of climbing 0.3 percent as previously reported. October's decrease was the first since April, when stringent measures to control the first wave of coronavirus cases crippled the economy. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales declined 0.5 percent last month. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

Outbreak sickens staffers at county health department in Arizona A county health official in Arizona tested positive for Covid-19 after an apparent outbreak within the department. Dr. Theresa Cullen, the health director for Pima County, tested positive on Tuesday, the county announced Wednesday. The apparent outbreak infected 11 employees, it said, adding that all staff members who work at the main building were being offered testing and would work remotely while the location was being cleaned. “This just goes to prove that when there is substantial community spread of the virus like we’re experiencing now throughout the County, the virus can get into your homes and places of work any number of ways no matter how vigilant you are being with your precautions,” said County Chief Medical Officer Dr. Francisco Garcia in a news release. Protesters held a demonstration at the health department last Thursday over its Covid-19 measures. Many of the participants were not wearing masks and came in close contact with staff members, the department said. Contact tracers have not determined the source of the outbreak, and the county said at least one health department employee had tested positive before the protest. Roughly 300 Pima County employees have contacted Covid-19 since February, and more than 60 of those cases have occurred in just the past two weeks, according to Pima County Administrator Chuck Huckelberry. More than 8,000 Pima County residents have tested positive for the virus in the past week, according to county testing data. Share this -

Tyson fires 7 managers at Iowa plant after virus betting investigation Tyson Foods terminated seven managers from an Iowa pork plant following an independent investigation into allegations that they wagered on how many workers would get infected with Covid-19, the meat processing giant announced Wednesday. All of those fired worked at the plant in Waterloo, Iowa. The wagering allegations stem from a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of deceased Tyson Foods Inc. employee Isidro Fernandez. It stated that management did not do enough to protect employees while Covid-19 rapidly spread through the plant in early April. According to the suit, 1,000 of 2,800 employees at the Waterloo plant were infected. Read the full story. Share this -

Health experts warn of potential Covid-19 vaccine scam phone calls Public health officials are warning of scammers who promise early access to the vaccine for people who hand over their Social Security Number to callers. “If you're receiving unsolicited offers for a vaccine — not one, not two, but about 10 red flags should go up,” Nenette Day, assistant special agent in charge at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, told NBC News. “There is no way that you under any circumstance should deal with anybody except a known and reputable medical provider or pharmacy,” Day added. If consumers receive a call they suspect is fraudulent, the first step is to hang up. If the call is from a legitimate health care provider, consumers should match the number listed on the back of their health insurance card to the caller ID. For more information on coronavirus-related scams, or to report Covid-19 fraud, consumers can visit the HHS website, or call the HHS hotline at 800-477-8477. Read the story here. Share this -

Study: 69% of undocumented immigrant workers 'essential' to fighting virus WASHINGTON — More than two-thirds of undocumented immigrant workers have frontline jobs considered ""essential"" to the U.S. fight against Covid-19, according to a new study released Wednesday by pro-immigration reform group FWD.US. Sixty-nine percent of undocumented immigrant workers have jobs deemed essential by the Department of Homeland Security, according to the study, which is based on the 2019 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau. The study also estimated that nearly one in five essential workers is an immigrant. By contrast, the Trump administration has argued that protecting American jobs against foreign workers is crucial to fixing the economic harm caused by Covid-19. Read the full story.

107-year-old Minnesota woman survives Covid-19 A Minnesota centenarian recovered from Covid-19 after contracting the virus in November. Tillie Dybing, who turned 107 over the summer and lives in a nursing home in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, has survived not just one, but two viral pandemics. She was five years old when the 1918 flu pandemic hit her hometown in North Dakota, sickening her parents. “My folks got sick and they were in bed, and I'd run into the bed and my dad said, ‘Can't you find another place to run,’” Dybing told NBC News affiliate KARE. Her family was worried when she contracted Covid-19 in the fall because her age put her at high risk for severe complications from the coronavirus. “We were really concerned and though, ‘well, this is probably it,’” her daughter Susan Berke told KARE. But after two weeks of fatigue and no severe symptoms, Dybing, who also survived uterine cancer at 95, was moved out of quarantine after fully recovering from the virus. “I thought, well, if the time has come that I have to leave, then I will go, but I'm still here,” Dybing told KARE.

FDA authorizes at-home Covid-19 test with prescription The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization on Wednesday to an at-home Covid-19 test that people can use with a prescription. The BinaxNOW Covid-19 Ag Card Home Test, developed by Abbott and eMed, is an antigen test, which is designed to detect fragments of viral proteins that trigger an immune response in the body. For people who are 15 years or older, the test uses a self-collected nasal swab sample that is analyzed through a smartphone app under the supervision of an eMed telehealth provider. For patients younger than 15, the FDA recommends that an adult perform the nasal swab. Test results can be delivered in approximately 20 minutes, according to eMed. The test correctly identified 91.7 percent of positive samples and 100 percent of negative samples in people with symptoms, but Abbott said results from four investigational sites are still being analyzed. The tests will cost $25, and 30 million kits are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2021, with an additional 90 million tests available in the second quarter, according to Abbott. On Tuesday, the FDA authorized a separate at-home Covid-19 test that does not need a prescription. That antigen test, developed by Ellume, will also be available in January. Share this -

Two tech groups say they’ll merge efforts on digital vaccine cards Two groups of technologists said Wednesday they were combining their work to speed up the development of digital vaccine cards, so that people may eventually be able to use a smartphone app to prove they’ve gotten a Covid-19 vaccine. Digital vaccine certificates, or passports, are expected to be in demand next year as a possible requirement for international air travel or in-person gatherings. They would be an electronic version of the paper-based “yellow cards” that have been around for decades, but they’re not a reality yet because of complications around privacy and interoperability. One of the tech groups, the Linux Foundation Public Health, was involved in earlier efforts to roll out pandemic-related apps that alert users when they’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive for the coronavirus. The foundation said it would host the work of the other group, the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, which sprung up this year specifically to work on digital vaccine cards. The two groups plan to work with public health authorities on challenges including the ethics of digital vaccine cards, said Lucy Yang, co-lead of the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative.

Twitter to remove false vaccine conspiracy theory tweets Twitter announced on Wednesday it would remove false or misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines. The move follows similar actions by YouTube in October and Facebook in December. Twitter said it would remove tweets that advance “harmful or misleading narratives,” including false claims about the vaccines that have been “widely debunked about the adverse impacts of receiving vaccinations” and false claims that Covid-19 is “not real or not serious.” The changes will begin until next week, and the company will also ban tweets about global conspiracy theories that suggest vaccines are “used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations.” Conspiracy theories around Covid-19 vaccines have spread unabated on social media since the summer, according to a recent report from First Draft, a global nonprofit organization that researches online misinformation. Vaccine-related conspiracy content accounted for some 10 percent of total vaccine posts, according to the report. Anti-vaccination groups have created organized campaigns since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, some claiming outlandish global conspiracies about secret societies and microchips. The conspiracy theories have gone wildly viral on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, including the repeatedly debunked viral video “Plandemic,” which took off due to coordinated cross-promotion by anti-vaccine groups that existed well before the pandemic.

'Don't be afraid': In Puerto Rico, respiratory therapist gets first Covid vaccine SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico— A respiratory therapist who treated the first two COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Puerto Rico became the first person in the U.S. territory to be vaccinated against the virus on Tuesday. Yahaira Alicea had treated an Italian couple who visited the island aboard a cruise ship in March. The woman later died. Alicea said it was a fearful moment for her that wore her down physically and emotionally as she urged everyone to get vaccinated. “This is what we want, for this pandemic to end,” Alicea said. “Don’t be afraid.” A health official approached Alicea with the needle as both smiled: “Let’s make history.” Click here to read the full story.

Direct cash payments under consideration as lawmakers near Covid aid deal WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders and the White House are nearing agreement on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal that will likely include a new round of direct payments, three sources familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday. The emerging package will include enhanced federal jobless benefits, small business funding and money to distribute Covid-19 vaccines. The dollar amount of the stimulus payments has not yet been determined — some aides said it could be $600-per-person while others said it may be higher. Negotiators have not yet settled on an income cap for the direct payments, as was done for the previous round of payments approved in March. The proposal, which is still being finalized and does not have leadership agreement, is not expected to include liability protections for employers or state or local funding, two sticking points in negotiations that prevented Congress from passing meaningful Covid-19 legislation for months.

Operation Warp Speed: Covid-19 vaccine deliveries on track An additional 886 shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine are scheduled for delivery to health care systems nationwide on Thursday and Friday, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, Army Gen. Gustave Perna, said during a media briefing Wednesday. Together with deliveries that have already been distributed, a total of 1,522 shipments of the vaccine will have been shipped in the first week. Each shipment contains about 1,000 doses. Because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, each shipment has a temperature monitoring system. Perna said that while most shipments have gone smoothly, a few boxes sent to California and Alabama arrived at the incorrect temperature. Those boxes were removed from distribution before any shots could be given and replaced. The first doses of the vaccine have gone to health care workers. Several states are now starting vaccinations in long-term care facilities, or will be doing so imminently. They are Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and West Virginia. By Monday, 1,110 long-term care facilities are anticipated to have the vaccine, with thousands more long-term care facilities added daily, Perna said. Share this -

2020-12-17 02:32:02+00:00,126,"A Texas couple married for 30 years who were hospitalized with Covid-19 were holding hands as they both died on Sunday, their family says.

Paul Blackwell, 61, and Rosemary Blackwell, 65 — longtime educators of Grand Prairie Independent School District — died just minutes apart at Harris Methodist Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, two of their sons told NBC News.

The couple contracted the virus nearly a week before Thanksgiving. “It really took a toll on them pretty quickly,” son Shawn Blackwell said of his parents after they began exhibiting symptoms.

He said his mother was having shortness of breath at night and wasn’t sleeping. His father laid on the couch for four days. Their deteriorating conditions forced them to miss Thanksgiving with their children for the first time.

“There’s not been one Thanksgiving we’ve never spent together,” son Brandon Blackwell said.

The Friday after the holiday the couple was admitted to the hospital, where they’d spend the next few weeks fighting for their lives.

“It was hard to have them in the hospital,” Shawn Blackwell said.

The brothers weren’t able to physically see their parents and were only able to video chat with them. Their father broke down on one of those video calls, saying he didn't think he was going to make it.

“Their spirits were not too high during their hospital stay,"" Brandon Blackwell said. ""But just us being there, I know, gave them some type of comfort. I was just glad they were able to see our faces.”

It was shortly after video calls with their children that the Blackwells were transferred to the intensive care unit.

“My little brother Shawn got to speak with my mom right before she got intubated and I was able to speak with my dad right before he got intubated, so it was crazy how that worked out,” Brandon Blackwell said.

The next time the sons would see their parents would be on their deathbeds.

“My dad wasn’t going to make it too much longer and my mom was right behind him,” Shawn Blackwell said. After consulting the doctors, the family made the difficult decision discontinue their life support.

Paul and Rosemary Blackwell died holding each other's hands — and the hands of Shawn and Brandon Blackwell, finally able to see their parents in person.

“It was definitely the hardest decision we ever had to deal with in our entire lives, but knowing that they’re together and the amazing parents that they were, we gave them a beautiful send off,"" Shawn Blackwell said. ""We wish it hadn’t happened to our parents, but it does make us feel a little better that they’re both together.""

The couple spent their careers as dedicated educators. Paul Blackwell was a P.E. teacher, mentor and coach at Fannin Middle School for five years. Prior to that, he taught at the Young Men’s Leadership Academy at Kennedy Middle School. Rosemary Blackwell was a second grade teacher at Travis World Language Academy and was the school's longest-tenured educator.

“Rosemary and Paul will be greatly missed by many. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their family, friends, co-workers, and students both current and former,” Grand Prairie Independent School District said in a statement to NBC News.

“They absolutely loved their jobs,” Brandon Blackwell said. “I tried to get my mother to retire years ago and she just said, ‘No, I love what I do.’ She drove 45 minutes for 20 years to work at 6:30 in the morning every day.”

The family said Rosemary Blackwell was finally due to retire this year, along with her husband, to enjoy their grandchildren — all 20 of them.

“Them being in their sixties,"" Shawn Blackwell said, “they still had many years ahead of them.”

The family isn’t sure how the couple contracted the virus. “They were fearful of the virus and took every precaution,” Brandon Blackwell said.

“You see your parents as superheroes and as the ones that are always there for you, and there’s nothing that’s ever supposed to happen them that's bad, and we got a real big dose of reality,” Shawn Blackwell said.

The sons say they take comfort that they could be with their parents in their final moments — and that their parents could with one another until the end.

“It did give us some sense of closure that they both went together because, honestly, it would’ve been weird to have one without the other,” Shawn Blackwell said.

2020-12-17 00:23:04+00:00,58,"A health care worker at the Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska, developed a severe allergic reaction shortly after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine Tuesday evening, and had to be hospitalized overnight.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

During a media briefing Wednesday, health officials said the middle-aged woman had no history of allergies and had never experienced anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction.

Bartlett Regional Hospital officials said all 96 of its workers who received the vaccine Tuesday were observed for 30 minutes after the shot. The woman starting feeling flushed about 10 minutes into that observation period, and took Benadryl, an antihistamine.

However, her symptoms progressed to an elevated heart rate and shortness of breath, and was sent to the hospital's emergency department.

""She had a red, flushed rash over her face and torso,"" Dr. Lindy Jones, the emergency physician who treated her, said during the briefing Wednesday. ""I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction."" Jones gave her an emergency injection of epinephrine.

Her symptoms abated for a short time, but then re-emerged. She was put on intravenous epinephrine, and moved to the hospital's intensive care unit where she remained overnight. Jones said the woman did not necessarily require ICU resources, but added, ""we are a small little hospital here, so if we are concerned about anyone, we put them in the ICU.""

As of Wednesday morning, the woman was off all medications, and was expected to be discharged Wednesday evening.

Pfizer said in a statement that the company is ""working with local health authorities to assess"" the reaction that occurred in Alaska, and will ""closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed.""

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

That hospital officials were able to identify the reaction and treat it appropriately ""demonstrates that the vaccine safety monitoring system is strong and robust for handling the pandemic response,"" Dr. Jay Butler, head of the Covid-19 response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.

Butler said the Alaska case is the only allergic reaction to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reported in the United States so far.

Two health care workers in the United Kingdom experienced similar allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine last week. After the Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine for emergency use in the U.S., the regulatory agency said people with a history of allergic reactions should speak with their doctors about the vaccine, but added there was not enough evidence to suggest the majority of people with allergies steer clear of the shots.

Allergic reactions to vaccines or other medications are rare, but do occur. Any facility qualified to administer vaccines is equipped with emergency epinephrine (known to many as an EpiPen) in the event of severe reactions.

Despite her reaction and subsequent hospitalization, health officials said, the health care worker ""was enthusiastic that she got the vaccine,"" specifically about the benefits it might eventually offer her.

Still, Butler said the woman will be advised to skip the second dose.

Pence, who is the head of the White House coronavirus task force, is hoping to ""promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people,"" the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.

His wife, Karen Pence, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams will receive the vaccine at Friday's event, set to take place at the White House.

Biden meanwhile is expected to receive the vaccine as soon as next week, a transition official tells NBC News.

“I don’t want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,” Biden told reporters earlier Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware. “When I do it, I’ll do it publicly so you can all witness my getting it done.”

The decision to receive the vaccine in public marks a critical moment in the fight against Covid-19 as health care officials battle skepticism by some about the safety of the vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration cleared the way for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to be used for emergency use this month as the country is still deep in the pandemic, with case numbers rising around the country.

The virus has killed more than 300,000 people and infected more than 16.3 million in the U.S. alone.

Health care workers across the United States were among the first Americans to get the federally-approved coronavirus vaccine this week.

Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton have also volunteered to take the vaccine on camera to help build public trust in the coronavirus vaccine. It's unclear when President Donald Trump will receive a vaccine. During Monday’s briefing press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president “is absolutely open to taking the vaccine.""",MSNBC,"['week', 'covid19', 'publicly', 'president', 'coronavirus', 'biden', 'covid', 'receive', 'white', 'safety', 'pence', 'vaccine', 'public', 'soon']",0

Outbreak sickens staffers at county health department in Arizona A county health official in Arizona tested positive for Covid-19 after an apparent outbreak within the department. Dr. Theresa Cullen, the health director for Pima County, tested positive on Tuesday, the county announced Wednesday. The apparent outbreak infected 11 employees, it said, adding that all staff members who work at the main building were being offered testing and would work remotely while the location was being cleaned. “This just goes to prove that when there is substantial community spread of the virus like we’re experiencing now throughout the County, the virus can get into your homes and places of work any number of ways no matter how vigilant you are being with your precautions,” said County Chief Medical Officer Dr. Francisco Garcia in a news release. Protesters held a demonstration at the health department last Thursday over its Covid-19 measures. Many of the participants were not wearing masks and came in close contact with staff members, the department said. Contact tracers have not determined the source of the outbreak, and the county said at least one health department employee had tested positive before the protest. Roughly 300 Pima County employees have contacted Covid-19 since February, and more than 60 of those cases have occurred in just the past two weeks, according to Pima County Administrator Chuck Huckelberry. More than 8,000 Pima County residents have tested positive for the virus in the past week, according to county testing data. Share this -

Tyson fires 7 managers at Iowa plant after virus betting investigation Tyson Foods terminated seven managers from an Iowa pork plant following an independent investigation into allegations that they wagered on how many workers would get infected with Covid-19, the meat processing giant announced Wednesday. All of those fired worked at the plant in Waterloo, Iowa. The wagering allegations stem from a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of deceased Tyson Foods Inc. employee Isidro Fernandez. It stated that management did not do enough to protect employees while Covid-19 rapidly spread through the plant in early April. According to the suit, 1,000 of 2,800 employees at the Waterloo plant were infected. Read the full story. Share this -

Health experts warn of potential Covid-19 vaccine scam phone calls Public health officials are warning of scammers who promise early access to the vaccine for people who hand over their Social Security Number to callers. “If you're receiving unsolicited offers for a vaccine — not one, not two, but about 10 red flags should go up,” Nenette Day, assistant special agent in charge at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, told NBC News. “There is no way that you under any circumstance should deal with anybody except a known and reputable medical provider or pharmacy,” Day added. If consumers receive a call they suspect is fraudulent, the first step is to hang up. If the call is from a legitimate health care provider, consumers should match the number listed on the back of their health insurance card to the caller ID. For more information on coronavirus-related scams, or to report Covid-19 fraud, consumers can visit the HHS website, or call the HHS hotline at 800-477-8477. Read the story here. Share this -

Study: 69% of undocumented immigrant workers 'essential' to fighting virus WASHINGTON — More than two-thirds of undocumented immigrant workers have frontline jobs considered ""essential"" to the U.S. fight against Covid-19, according to a new study released Wednesday by pro-immigration reform group FWD.US. Sixty-nine percent of undocumented immigrant workers have jobs deemed essential by the Department of Homeland Security, according to the study, which is based on the 2019 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau. The study also estimated that nearly one in five essential workers is an immigrant. By contrast, the Trump administration has argued that protecting American jobs against foreign workers is crucial to fixing the economic harm caused by Covid-19. Read the full story.

107-year-old Minnesota woman survives Covid-19 A Minnesota centenarian recovered from Covid-19 after contracting the virus in November. Tillie Dybing, who turned 107 over the summer and lives in a nursing home in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, has survived not just one, but two viral pandemics. She was five years old when the 1918 flu pandemic hit her hometown in North Dakota, sickening her parents. “My folks got sick and they were in bed, and I'd run into the bed and my dad said, ‘Can't you find another place to run,’” Dybing told NBC News affiliate KARE. Her family was worried when she contracted Covid-19 in the fall because her age put her at high risk for severe complications from the coronavirus. “We were really concerned and though, ‘well, this is probably it,’” her daughter Susan Berke told KARE. But after two weeks of fatigue and no severe symptoms, Dybing, who also survived uterine cancer at 95, was moved out of quarantine after fully recovering from the virus. “I thought, well, if the time has come that I have to leave, then I will go, but I'm still here,” Dybing told KARE.

FDA authorizes at-home Covid-19 test with prescription The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization on Wednesday to an at-home Covid-19 test that people can use with a prescription. The BinaxNOW Covid-19 Ag Card Home Test, developed by Abbott and eMed, is an antigen test, which is designed to detect fragments of viral proteins that trigger an immune response in the body. For people who are 15 years or older, the test uses a self-collected nasal swab sample that is analyzed through a smartphone app under the supervision of an eMed telehealth provider. For patients younger than 15, the FDA recommends that an adult perform the nasal swab. Test results can be delivered in approximately 20 minutes, according to eMed. The test correctly identified 91.7 percent of positive samples and 100 percent of negative samples in people with symptoms, but Abbott said results from four investigational sites are still being analyzed. The tests will cost $25, and 30 million kits are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2021, with an additional 90 million tests available in the second quarter, according to Abbott. On Tuesday, the FDA authorized a separate at-home Covid-19 test that does not need a prescription. That antigen test, developed by Ellume, will also be available in January. Share this -

Two tech groups say they’ll merge efforts on digital vaccine cards Two groups of technologists said Wednesday they were combining their work to speed up the development of digital vaccine cards, so that people may eventually be able to use a smartphone app to prove they’ve gotten a Covid-19 vaccine. Digital vaccine certificates, or passports, are expected to be in demand next year as a possible requirement for international air travel or in-person gatherings. They would be an electronic version of the paper-based “yellow cards” that have been around for decades, but they’re not a reality yet because of complications around privacy and interoperability. One of the tech groups, the Linux Foundation Public Health, was involved in earlier efforts to roll out pandemic-related apps that alert users when they’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive for the coronavirus. The foundation said it would host the work of the other group, the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, which sprung up this year specifically to work on digital vaccine cards. The two groups plan to work with public health authorities on challenges including the ethics of digital vaccine cards, said Lucy Yang, co-lead of the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative.

Twitter to remove false vaccine conspiracy theory tweets Twitter announced on Wednesday it would remove false or misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines. The move follows similar actions by YouTube in October and Facebook in December. Twitter said it would remove tweets that advance “harmful or misleading narratives,” including false claims about the vaccines that have been “widely debunked about the adverse impacts of receiving vaccinations” and false claims that Covid-19 is “not real or not serious.” The changes will begin until next week, and the company will also ban tweets about global conspiracy theories that suggest vaccines are “used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations.” Conspiracy theories around Covid-19 vaccines have spread unabated on social media since the summer, according to a recent report from First Draft, a global nonprofit organization that researches online misinformation. Vaccine-related conspiracy content accounted for some 10 percent of total vaccine posts, according to the report. Anti-vaccination groups have created organized campaigns since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, some claiming outlandish global conspiracies about secret societies and microchips. The conspiracy theories have gone wildly viral on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, including the repeatedly debunked viral video “Plandemic,” which took off due to coordinated cross-promotion by anti-vaccine groups that existed well before the pandemic.

Direct cash payments under consideration as lawmakers near Covid aid deal WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders and the White House are nearing agreement on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal that will likely include a new round of direct payments, three sources familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday. The emerging package will include enhanced federal jobless benefits, small business funding and money to distribute Covid-19 vaccines. The dollar amount of the stimulus payments has not yet been determined — some aides said it could be $600-per-person while others said it may be higher. Negotiators have not yet settled on an income cap for the direct payments, as was done for the previous round of payments approved in March. The proposal, which is still being finalized and does not have leadership agreement, is not expected to include liability protections for employers or state or local funding, two sticking points in negotiations that prevented Congress from passing meaningful Covid-19 legislation for months.

Operation Warp Speed: Covid-19 vaccine deliveries on track An additional 886 shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine are scheduled for delivery to health care systems nationwide on Thursday and Friday, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, Army Gen. Gustave Perna, said during a media briefing Wednesday. Together with deliveries that have already been distributed, a total of 1,522 shipments of the vaccine will have been shipped in the first week. Each shipment contains about 1,000 doses. Because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, each shipment has a temperature monitoring system. Perna said that while most shipments have gone smoothly, a few boxes sent to California and Alabama arrived at the incorrect temperature. Those boxes were removed from distribution before any shots could be given and replaced. The first doses of the vaccine have gone to health care workers. Several states are now starting vaccinations in long-term care facilities, or will be doing so imminently. They are Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and West Virginia. By Monday, 1,110 long-term care facilities are anticipated to have the vaccine, with thousands more long-term care facilities added daily, Perna said. Share this -

Covid-19 vaccines are being hoarded by rich countries — poor ones are missing out LONDON — Lost among the jubilation of America's vaccine rollout this week is an uncomfortable reality: The world's poorest countries will have to wait months and possibly years to see any doses at all. The U.S., Canada, Britain and the European Union have pre-ordered enough Covid-19 shots to inoculate their populations several times over, subject to regulatory approvals. In this critical game of medicine logistics — where supply is small but demand immediate and universal — campaigners and some officials accuse these wealthy nations of snapping up orders and hoarding more than they need. The People's Vaccine Alliance, a collaboration between several aid groups including Oxfam and Amnesty International, has said that unless drastic measures are taken nearly 70 poor countries will be unable to vaccinate 90 percent of their populations next year.

Restaurants worry bipartisan coronavirus deal is cutting them out The White House and congressional leaders are nearing the finish line on a bipartisan Covid-19 relief deal. But they’re running up against objections from a coalition of restaurants who argue the emerging plan will leave them without enough aid to get through the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic. The Independent Restaurant Coalition, a group of chefs and owners formed to advocate for aid during the pandemic, has been decrying the emerging proposal throughout the last month as insufficient. Instead they’re urging Congress to pass the RESTAURANTS Act, a bipartisan bill that would provide $120 billion in grants to smaller bars and restaurants to make up revenue lost due to coronavirus. On paper, their task should be easy. Lawmakers of both parties are eager to back aid for local bars and restaurants. The bill has 50 sponsors in the Senate and over 200 in the House. Over 160 members sent a letter to House and Senate leaders earlier this month, including other members of leadership like Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, asking for it to be included in relief talks. ""If Mitch McConnell brought this to the floor this would pass easily,” Tom Colicchio, the Top Chef judge, restaurateur, and IRC co-founder, told NBC News.

Retail sales plunged in November, as shoppers stayed home amid rising Covid cases Retail sales fell for a second straight month in November, likely weighed down by raging new Covid-19 infections and decreasing household income, adding to growing signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession. Retail sales dropped 1.1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for October was revised down to show sales falling 0.1 percent instead of climbing 0.3 percent as previously reported. October's decrease was the first since April, when stringent measures to control the first wave of coronavirus cases crippled the economy. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales declined 0.5 percent last month. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Click here to read the full story. Share this -

The findings set the Moderna vaccine up for emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration by the end of this week, meaning Americans could soon have two highly effective Covid-19 vaccines, after the first shots of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine were given to health care workers on Monday.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The high efficacy of the Moderna vaccine was noted after two doses given 28 days apart. This is about the same level of effectiveness as the Pfizer vaccine.

But there is also evidence suggesting that just one dose of Moderna's may stop the virus's spread. A second document published on the FDA website Tuesday shows asymptomatic infection was reduced by 63 percent after the first shot.

More data are needed to fully understand that finding.

""We're holding our breath,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

""If we also reduce transmission — make people much less apt to be contagious — as well as protecting them from serious disease, that would be a double bonus,"" Schaffner, who is not involved with the Moderna vaccine research, said.

Even those who have been closely involved with Moderna's Phase 3 clinical trials advise caution when interpreting the preliminary results that suggest the vaccine curbs transmission.

""Keep in mind, these are small numbers,"" said Dr. Hana El Sahly, principal investigator for the Moderna studies at Baylor College of Medicine. ""Regardless, it's a trend in the right direction.""

It is expected that regulators will require two doses of the vaccine for maximum protection. Until it's clear that any vaccine effectively prevents spread of the virus, tried and true methods of prevention remain critical.

""We need to be using all of the interventions we have in our arsenal right now,"" said Jessica Atwell, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Immunization Research. ""We know that hand washing and masking and physical distancing can reduce transmission from one person to another.""

A committee independent of the FDA, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, will meet Thursday to decide whether to recommend that the agency greenlight the Moderna vaccine. The meeting will largely mirror the one from last Thursday, when the panel of experts ultimately recommended that the FDA authorize Pfizer's vaccine.

The most common side effects associated with the Moderna vaccine were fatigue, headache and muscle pain. Rarely, nausea and facial swelling were also reported, according to the FDA documents.

El Sahly acknowledged that ""with the second dose, there's an increase in the symptoms of fatigue, headache, and fever, compared to the first dose,"" but added that those symptoms were manageable.

Overall, the data showed people over age 64 had fewer side effects than younger adults.

The vaccines from both drugmakers work the same way, using tiny snippets of genetic code, called mRNA, to train the body to fight off the coronavirus.

It is widely anticipated that the Moderna vaccine's path to authorization will be similar to Pfizer's. An authorization could come as soon as Friday. Moderna will ask for authorization for adults over age 18.

Indeed, officials with Operation Warp Speed are already planning for widespread distribution of the Moderna vaccine.

On Monday, Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said that, assuming the FDA authorizes the Moderna vaccine, nearly 6 million doses will be shipped to 3,285 locations across the country.

2020-12-14 22:02:04+00:00,24,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, made a direct appeal to Americans Sunday to ""hit the reset button"" on skepticism of approved Covid-19 vaccines, stressing that the independent nature of the approval process and the strong safety measures that should give the public confidence.

In an interview on ""Meet the Press,"" Collins said that mistrust of vaccines continues to be a source of great concern to public health officials, insisting that anyone who wants to “look at the facts” surrounding the vaccine’s development, testing and safety record should “be very reassured.”

“I would like to plead to people who are listening to this this morning to really hit the reset button on whatever they think they knew about this vaccine that might cause them to be so skeptical. The data is out there now,” he said.

“This is a very powerful outcome of this incredibly intense, yearlong experience, to develop this. I think all reasonable people — if they had the chance to put the noise aside and disregard all those terrible conspiracy theories — would look at this and say: I want this for my family, I want it for myself. People are dying right now; how could you possibly say let’s wait and see if that might mean some terrible tragedy is going to befall.”

The Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in the United States on Friday, making it the first vaccine to receive that status in the country.

The vaccine began to be shipped Sunday morning, and some vaccinations will begin early this week.

Pfizer’s Phase 3 trials found its vaccine to be 95 percent effective when given in two doses, three weeks apart. It also found that only one shot provides about 50 percent immunity from Covid-19, so the FDA says two shots are necessary.

The Pfizer vaccine has already received some form of authorization in the United Kingdom, Canada and Bahrain. And more vaccines are already in the latter stages of development.

But for months, polling has shown that a significant portion of America is skeptical about getting a Covid-19 vaccine themselves.

President Donald Trump has sought to take credit for the vaccine's quick and effective development. And he’s put pressure on public health officials to approve the vaccine for widespread use. For example, ahead of the FDA’s approval announcement on Friday, Trump tweeted that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn should “get the dam (sic) vaccines out now” and “stop playing games and start saving lives.”

When asked whether rhetoric like that has contributed to the public sentiment about the vaccine, Collins replied “I think that is part of the skepticism, along with a lot of other things that reflect the terrible polarization we have in this country about absolutely everything.”

“There have been few if any vaccines that have ever been subjected to this level of scrutiny. If you want to look at the facts, I think you should be very reassured,” Collins said.

“Put aside all of the noise and, yeah, all of the skepticism that’s born of potential interference from some source or another. That did not determine the outcome. This was based upon scientific decision-making.”

As the vaccine is sent out across the country for initial inoculations, Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to soar in America.

There are currently more than 108,000 people in American hospitals with Covid-19, according to the Covid Tracking Project, as current hospitalization numbers have continued to rise each of the last seven days.

There were more than 210,000 new cases in America on Saturday, with three states (Delaware, South Carolina and West Virginia) setting new, single-day case records. And there were 2,376 deaths attributable to the virus on Saturday, with Alaska and Massachusetts setting daily death records, according to an NBC News analysis.

It's against that worsening backdrop that Collins said widespread vaccination will be so important.

“It’s going to depend on the American public quite a bit in terms of whether people are willing to take part in this immunization plan,” he said.

“The experts would say we need 70-80 percent of Americans to be immune before this virus will basically give up and it will be gone. And we think we can get there by June or so for almost all the 330 million Americans interested in getting this vaccine. But if only half of them do so, this could go on and on and on.”

And he noted that while it’s clear the vaccine provides people with strong protection from a symptomatic Covid-19 infection, scientists still need a few more months to learn whether a vaccinated individual could still spread the infection to others without knowing they have it.

That’s why Collins said masks will still need to be an essential part of American life for many more months.

“Masks are still going to be part of our life, we need to recognize that and not step away or drop our guard,” he said.

“We've got to absolutely double down on all the things Americans can do to save lives, and look at the lives that we have lost and the tragedy that is there. If we have a chance to make these next few months, which otherwise could be very dark, just a little bit better, why wouldn’t we do that?”",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'nih', 'need', 'collins', 'leave', 'look', 'conspiracy', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'director', 'terrible', 'theories', 'americans', 'asks', 'think', 'public', 'facts']",0

It’s time to consider that there is, in fact, a politician willing to inflict more pain and suffering on Americans than President Donald Trump. And his name is Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.

The Senate Majority Leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than died in the Twin Towers.

Today, McConnell is the grim reaper in a much more literal sense. As Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., summed it up: ""Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession,"" he tweeted in the wake of yet another awful set of unemployment numbers. ""One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell's political games are costing lives and livelihoods.""

Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession. One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell’s political games are costing lives and livelihoods. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) December 4, 2020

This is not mere partisan hyperbole. The Senate majority leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than those who died in the terror attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center; as 1 in 8 Americans go hungry; as millions of Americans enter permanent unemployment.

What does McConnell offer them? A “skinny” stimulus bill, consisting of a mere $500 billion in aid, when the near-consensus view among top economists is that it needs to be at least $2 trillion. Skinny? Try “emaciated,” as Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put it in September. In October, when the Trump administration tried to reach a $1.8 trillion compromise with congressional Democrats, it was McConnell who shot it down.

But he was unshaken; $500 billion, he intoned. Not a penny more.

McConnell’s refusal to authorize further government spending in the midst of this crisis has had — and will continue to have — deadly consequences. We learned this the hard way after the 2008 financial crash.

A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal found that the “squeeze on public finances” in the wake of the crash was “linked to nearly 120,000 excess deaths in England.” A 2014 study in the British Journal of Psychiatry found the Great Recession led to more than 10,000 added suicides in Europe and North America. “Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death,” wrote sociologist David Stuckler and epidemiologist Sanjay Basu, co-authors of the book, “The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills,” in 2013. “What we have found is that austerity — severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending — is not only self-defeating, but fatal.”

The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but the worst health crisis since the Spanish Flu.

Today, state and local governments are on their knees and begging for federal aid. So, too, are health care workers, as hospitals hit breaking point. Come the end of this month, as various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expire, millions of gig workers, freelancers, and long-term unemployed will lose their unemployment benefits; millions of renters will lose their homes as the nationwide eviction moratorium ends; tens of millions of borrowers will have to restart their student loan payments.

""All of this beyond outrageous. It should infuriate us all. We often say the United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Well what is the point...if you then say you cant afford to feed...house...employ your population?""



I got angry on the @mehdihasanshow: pic.twitter.com/Mh0ykIQIAi — Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) December 3, 2020

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference? The Senate majority leader is neither the architect of an illegal war, nor the former leader of a terrorist group. Nevertheless, he has much blood on his hands.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'relief', 'reaper', 'mcconnells', 'lives', 'leader', 'health', 'mitch', 'nickname', 'senate', 'economic', 'grim', 'americans', 'mcconnell', 'workers', 'covid', 'reality']",0

2020-12-14 14:11:04+00:00,35,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said late Sunday night that he decided to postpone a plan for White House staffers to soon receive the Covid-19 vaccine, saying they should receive it ""later"" in the rollout.

""People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary. I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time. Thank you!"" Trump said in a tweet.

This came after the National Security Council at the White House said Sunday that senior officials across all three branches of government, including the White House, executive agencies, Congress and the judiciary, would get early access to the vaccine.

NBC News reported that the early access was needed to ensure that there's a continuity of government, vaccinating people in high-level roles who are responsible for keeping the government functioning in a crisis. The specific timing of when they were supposed to receive the vaccine was not clear.

Over the last few months, more than 50 Trump administration officials, campaign officials or contacts within those orbits have tested positive for Covid-19. Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, was recently hospitalized in Washington, D.C., after testing positive for the disease but has been released.

Trump’s statement came ahead of the delivery Monday of the first federally approved coronavirus vaccine to 145 locations across all 50 states. An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that front-line health care workers and long-term care facilities should be prioritized to receive the vaccine first.

It's unclear, meanwhile, when President-elect Joe Biden, 78, will receive a vaccine.

On Friday, Biden did not answer a shouted question on the topic. Incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters:

""We've talked about this a little bit in the past couple of weeks, I don't have anything new for you in terms of our plans ... our focus at this point is really on what we can do to ensure that the vaccine is distributed, that it's safe, that we are planning for all scenarios.

A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal found that the “squeeze on public finances” in the wake of the crash was “linked to nearly 120,000 excess deaths in England.” A 2014 study in the British Journal of Psychiatry found the Great Recession led to more than 10,000 added suicides in Europe and North America. “Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death,” wrote sociologist David Stuckler and epidemiologist Sanjay Basu, co-authors of the book, “The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills,” in 2013. “What we have found is that austerity — severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending — is not only self-defeating, but fatal.”

The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but the worst health crisis since the Spanish Flu.

Today, state and local governments are on their knees and begging for federal aid. So, too, are health care workers, as hospitals hit breaking point. Come the end of this month, as various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expire, millions of gig workers, freelancers, and long-term unemployed will lose their unemployment benefits; millions of renters will lose their homes as the nationwide eviction moratorium ends; tens of millions of borrowers will have to restart their student loan payments.

""All of this beyond outrageous. It should infuriate us all. We often say the United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Well what is the point...if you then say you cant afford to feed...house...employ your population?""

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference? The Senate majority leader is neither the architect of an illegal war, nor the former leader of a terrorist group.

Pfizer is expected to deliver an estimated 2.9 million doses this week via UPS and FedEx, Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said Saturday. The vaccines leaving Portage — a city just south of Kalamazoo — have U.S. marshal protection to ensure they arrive safely at the hospital systems selected to receive the doses, some as early as Monday.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company was leveraging manufacturing plants in Michigan, Missouri and Massachusetts to produce and distribute the vaccines quickly.

“I couldn’t be prouder of my fellow Pfizer colleagues and partners at BioNTech,” Bourla said in a video statement. ""Their historic science-driven effort has delivered a vaccine with the potential to help bring an end to the most devastating pandemic in a century.""

The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine late Friday night. The United Kingdom became the first country to approve and distribute the Pfizer vaccine last week, where an initial batch of 800,000 went to hospital workers, nursing home staff and residents and people over the age of 80.

At least two health care workers in the U.K. had allergic reactions to the vaccine and were recovering. Both individuals had a history of allergies.

FDA scientists ""feel comfortable"" telling the American people to get the vaccine unless they have known allergies to other vaccines or the Pfizer vaccine ingredients, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Saturday.

""About 1.6 percent of the population has had a severe allergic reaction of some sort or another to a food or some environmental aspect,"" Marks said. ""We would really not like to have that many people not be able to receive the vaccine.""

Vaccine rollout in the U.S. will prioritize high-risk populations, such as hospital workers and nursing home staff and residents, to receive inoculations in the first phase. It’s unclear who will be prioritized in the second phase of the rollout.

Widespread vaccine availability for most Americans will likely occur in late spring or early summer next year, though residents in remote, rural locations may wait longer. Vaccines will be delivered at no cost, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Insurance providers will be expected to cover any fees associated with administering the inoculations, and the federal government will have a separate pool of funds for people who are uninsured.",MSNBC,"['portage', 'covid19', 'michigan', 'hospital', 'trucks', 'roll', 'residents', 'vaccines', 'pfizer', 'receive', 'plant', 'vaccine', 'workers', 'staff', 'week']",0
2020-12-13 16:15:05+00:00,51,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, made a direct appeal to Americans Sunday to ""hit the reset button"" on skepticism of approved Covid-19 vaccines, stressing that the independent nature of the approval process and the strong safety measures that should give the public confidence.

In an interview on ""Meet the Press,"" Collins said that mistrust of vaccines continues to be a source of great concern to public health officials, insisting that anyone who wants to “look at the facts” surrounding the vaccine’s development, testing and safety record should “be very reassured.”

“I would like to plead to people who are listening to this this morning to really hit the reset button on whatever they think they knew about this vaccine that might cause them to be so skeptical. The data is out there now,” he said.

“This is a very powerful outcome of this incredibly intense, yearlong experience, to develop this. I think all reasonable people — if they had the chance to put the noise aside and disregard all those terrible conspiracy theories — would look at this and say: I want this for my family, I want it for myself. People are dying right now; how could you possibly say let’s wait and see if that might mean some terrible tragedy is going to befall.”

The Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in the United States on Friday, making it the first vaccine to receive that status in the country.

The vaccine began to be shipped Sunday morning, and some vaccinations will begin early this week.

Pfizer’s Phase 3 trials found its vaccine to be 95 percent effective when given in two doses, three weeks apart. It also found that only one shot provides about 50 percent immunity from Covid-19, so the FDA says two shots are necessary.

The Pfizer vaccine has already received some form of authorization in the United Kingdom, Canada and Bahrain. And more vaccines are already in the latter stages of development.

But for months, polling has shown that a significant portion of America is skeptical about getting a Covid-19 vaccine themselves.

President Donald Trump has sought to take credit for the vaccine's quick and effective development. And he’s put pressure on public health officials to approve the vaccine for widespread use. For example, ahead of the FDA’s approval announcement on Friday, Trump tweeted that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn should “get the dam (sic) vaccines out now” and “stop playing games and start saving lives.”

When asked whether rhetoric like that has contributed to the public sentiment about the vaccine, Collins replied “I think that is part of the skepticism, along with a lot of other things that reflect the terrible polarization we have in this country about absolutely everything.”

“There have been few if any vaccines that have ever been subjected to this level of scrutiny. If you want to look at the facts, I think you should be very reassured,” Collins said.

“Put aside all of the noise and, yeah, all of the skepticism that’s born of potential interference from some source or another. That did not determine the outcome. This was based upon scientific decision-making.”

As the vaccine is sent out across the country for initial inoculations, Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to soar in America.

There are currently more than 108,000 people in American hospitals with Covid-19, according to the Covid Tracking Project, as current hospitalization numbers have continued to rise each of the last seven days.

There were more than 210,000 new cases in America on Saturday, with three states (Delaware, South Carolina and West Virginia) setting new, single-day case records. And there were 2,376 deaths attributable to the virus on Saturday, with Alaska and Massachusetts setting daily death records, according to an NBC News analysis.

It's against that worsening backdrop that Collins said widespread vaccination will be so important.

“It’s going to depend on the American public quite a bit in terms of whether people are willing to take part in this immunization plan,” he said.

“The experts would say we need 70-80 percent of Americans to be immune before this virus will basically give up and it will be gone. And we think we can get there by June or so for almost all the 330 million Americans interested in getting this vaccine. But if only half of them do so, this could go on and on and on.”

And he noted that while it’s clear the vaccine provides people with strong protection from a symptomatic Covid-19 infection, scientists still need a few more months to learn whether a vaccinated individual could still spread the infection to others without knowing they have it.

That’s why Collins said masks will still need to be an essential part of American life for many more months.

“Masks are still going to be part of our life, we need to recognize that and not step away or drop our guard,” he said.

“We've got to absolutely double down on all the things Americans can do to save lives, and look at the lives that we have lost and the tragedy that is there. If we have a chance to make these next few months, which otherwise could be very dark, just a little bit better, why wouldn’t we do that?”",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'nih', 'need', 'collins', 'leave', 'look', 'conspiracy', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'director', 'terrible', 'theories', 'americans', 'asks', 'think', 'public', 'facts']",0

2020-12-13 11:32:05+00:00,66,"CHICAGO — Like many Black people in Chicago, Etta Davis is afraid of catching Covid-19. She has a heart condition and diabetes and tries hard to wear her mask and stay safe. Yet, she doesn’t place much hope in the coming vaccine.

She hears city leaders say her community will be prioritized, but as a lower-income, Black woman on the South Side, she says she has good reason to doubt them.

""We're not gonna get it first, we know this,"" she said. ""I'm just keeping it real. Money talks to the people with the money. They’re going to get it first.""

The city of Chicago is gearing up to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine as early as next week, and officials are emphasizing that the process will be free and equitable. But many Black people, who are the most likely to die from the coronavirus, do not believe what they are hearing.

Just as the city is promoting vaccination in lower-income, Black neighborhoods, it is planning the shutdown of Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, a historic teaching hospital beloved by many Black people on the South Side. The coming closure has sparked anger and protests by residents who view the decision as evidence that city leaders and health officials do not care about their access to health care.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Davis said she is struggling to understand how a hospital serving a Black community could close in the middle of a pandemic disproportionately harming it. Black people have accounted for nearly 40 percent of Covid-19-related deaths in Chicago, but they comprise less than a third of the population. That disparity, Black residents said, makes it hard to trust officials who say Black people will receive a safe, equitable vaccine.

At a protest outside Mercy Hospital on Wednesday, Robin Hood, a pastor for Redeemed Outreach Ministries in Chicago, said the closure would sow distrust among community members, who have seen three other hospitals close across the city since 2018.

“They don't trust the government. They watched what happened to hospitals being closed in Chicago over the last 20 years. We've had several hospitals close,” Hood said. “Our communities are always left behind when it comes to the most basic needs, and that's health care.”

Trinity Health, which owns Mercy Hospital, has said the institution is not profitable enough and could close as soon as February. Patients and activists have asked the city to facilitate a sale of the hospital to a new owner who would commit to providing care for poor and Black Chicagoans.

With no current buyer, Mercy Hospital CEO Carol Schneider said the site will be turned into an urgent care center. Before it closes, the hospital will administer the Covid-19 vaccine “so all of us are working together with the city of Chicago to make sure that the vaccine gets to those that need it most as soon as possible.”

Chicagoan Antwain Miller shares Davis’ concern that “everything's about money.”

“I feel like the most disadvantaged folks would be left behind,” said Miller, who attended a protest against the closure and mentioned the long history of medical abuse of Black patients and his distrust of medical providers. “Would they give us the full-fledged vaccine? They might give us a generic version of the vaccine.”

There is no “generic” vaccine and no evidence that Black people will receive anything different than others, but Miller is not alone in wondering if Black people could be harmed or mistreated by providers.

Chicago resident Yolanda Pitts said she and her children will not take the vaccine: “The African American community, we're just not trusting you. Because we do feel like we're the first person that they want to test it on.”

Even residents who are looking forward to taking it do not fault their wary neighbors. Jitu Brown, a born-and-raised South Sider and the national director of the Journey for Justice Alliance, a racial justice group, blamed vaccination failures on politicians who lost the trust of the people they serve.

“Many of these people that beg for folks' votes and talk a progressive talk maintain the status quo. Ignoring community voice is the status quo. Underserving Black and brown communities is not courageous, it’s cowardly,” Brown said. “Be courageous, face this country's ugly and commit to transforming.

""Boxes are being packed and loaded with vaccine with emphasis on quality control,"" Perna said. Within the next 24 hours, he said, those boxes will move from Pfizer's manufacturing facility to UPS and FedEx hubs, where they will be delivered to 636 predetermined locations nationwide.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Perna said 145 of those sites should receive the vaccine Monday, with the others trickling in through Wednesday. The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine late Friday night.

An estimated 2.9 million doses will be distributed within the first week. That number is expected to ramp up significantly in the coming weeks, to as much as 40 million doses by the end of 2020.

State governors and health departments are in charge of the vaccine distribution to providers. A number of states are expected to start administering the shots simultaneously to both front-line health care workers and long-term care facilities, Perna said.

Less than a day after authorizing the first vaccine to protect against Covid-19, the FDA worked to ease lingering concerns over the possibility of severe allergic reactions to the Pfizer doses.

""We considered the potential allergic reactions carefully,"" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a briefing with reporters Saturday morning. He added that the FDA scientists ""feel comfortable"" telling the American people that unless they have specific allergies to other vaccines or vaccine ingredients, they can get the shot.

Scrutiny of the potential for vaccine-related allergies arose this past week, when the United Kingdom began administering the Pfizer vaccine. Two health care workers experienced serious allergic reactions, prompting British regulators to issue a warning for anyone with a history of severe allergies.

Marks said that after reviewing Pfizer's safety data, the FDA team found no reason to exclude the majority of people with allergies from getting the vaccine.

""About 1.6 percent of the population has had a severe allergic reaction of some sort or another to a food or some environmental aspect,"" Marks said. ""We would really not like to have that many people not be able to receive the vaccine.""

The potential for allergic reactions to vaccines — or any other medication — is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it is standard practice to warn consumers against the potential for allergic reactions to any pharmaceutical. Patients are asked in virtually all doctor visits about a history of drug allergies. And any facility qualified to administer vaccines is equipped with emergency epinephrine (known to many as an EpiPen) in the event of anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction.

Marks said those with a history of allergic reactions should speak with their physician about any Covid-19 vaccine.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Also Saturday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel recommended the vaccine for people age 16 and up and said pregnant women should consult with their doctors before getting it and people with serious allergic reactions to other vaccines should not get it.

The CDC group also said that the vaccine should be offered to people who have already had Covid, whether they had symptoms or not. The vaccine is also recommended for people with underlying health conditions or with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients or who have a chronic disease.

Medical systems nationwide are already preparing to receive Pfizer's vaccine, which has been shown to be nearly 95 percent effective when given in two doses, about three weeks apart.

Dr. Richard Besser, a former acting director of the CDC and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, offered a reminder that even highly effective vaccines will not be enough to curb the pandemic on their own.

""The potential of this moment to change the course of the pandemic will only be realized if it is accompanied by thoughtful action,"" Besser wrote in a statement to NBC News. ""Individuals must continue to follow proven public health guidance like wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and washing their hands.""

2020-12-13 04:01:04+00:00,26,"Melania Trump should have had 2020 off. The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Melania ""doesn't shake in her boots ever and she tells Donald exactly how she feels,"" says Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of the First Lady and ex-East Wing adviser.

She believes ""if he's going to do it, he better do it right and he better do it with brass knuckles."" pic.twitter.com/biXV2SmbBE — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) October 2, 2020

We got precious little time to savor the audio before the 2020 news cyclone swept it away. Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.

ok, FINE, we'll auto-tune the ""Christmas stuff"" thing into a carol 🎅🎄🦌 pic.twitter.com/VEprOK3QOP — The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) October 2, 2020

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Ah well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas — at least for a while. This time next year, it will be Jill Biden's turn to throw the soirees, but 'til then we'll have to muddle through somehow.",MSNBC,"['surging', 'melania', 'christmas', 'administration', 'know', 'doing', 'stuff', 'house', 'white', 'events', 'holiday', 'trump', 'covid']",0

The Food and Drug Administration said it had authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in the United States late Friday — the first major, tantalizing indication for Americans that the pandemic's days may be numbered.

A letter from the FDA to Pfizer reads that ""the known and potential benefits of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine"" outweigh its potential risks for people ages 16 and older.

FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn in a statement called the authorization ""a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world.""",MSNBC,"['world', 'covid19', 'ashanti', 'states', 'stephen', 'positive', 'significant', 'tantalizing', 'tested', 'statement', 'vaccine', 'potential', 'united', 'singer']",0

It’s time to consider that there is, in fact, a politician willing to inflict more pain and suffering on Americans than President Donald Trump. And his name is Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.

The Senate Majority Leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than died in the Twin Towers.

Today, McConnell is the grim reaper in a much more literal sense. As Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., summed it up: ""Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession,"" he tweeted in the wake of yet another awful set of unemployment numbers. ""One person is standing in the way.

Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession. One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell’s political games are costing lives and livelihoods. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) December 4, 2020

This is not mere partisan hyperbole. The Senate majority leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than those who died in the terror attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center; as 1 in 8 Americans go hungry; as millions of Americans enter permanent unemployment.

What does McConnell offer them? A “skinny” stimulus bill, consisting of a mere $500 billion in aid, when the near-consensus view among top economists is that it needs to be at least $2 trillion. Skinny? Try “emaciated,” as Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put it in September. In October, when the Trump administration tried to reach a $1.8 trillion compromise with congressional Democrats, it was McConnell who shot it down.

But he was unshaken; $500 billion, he intoned. Not a penny more.

McConnell’s refusal to authorize further government spending in the midst of this crisis has had — and will continue to have — deadly consequences. We learned this the hard way after the 2008 financial crash.

A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal found that the “squeeze on public finances” in the wake of the crash was “linked to nearly 120,000 excess deaths in England.” A 2014 study in the British Journal of Psychiatry found the Great Recession led to more than 10,000 added suicides in Europe and North America. “Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death,” wrote sociologist David Stuckler and epidemiologist Sanjay Basu, co-authors of the book, “The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills,” in 2013. “What we have found is that austerity — severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending — is not only self-defeating, but fatal.”

The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but the worst health crisis since the Spanish Flu.

Today, state and local governments are on their knees and begging for federal aid. So, too, are health care workers, as hospitals hit breaking point. Come the end of this month, as various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expire, millions of gig workers, freelancers, and long-term unemployed will lose their unemployment benefits; millions of renters will lose their homes as the nationwide eviction moratorium ends; tens of millions of borrowers will have to restart their student loan payments.

""All of this beyond outrageous. It should infuriate us all. We often say the United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Well what is the point...if you then say you cant afford to feed...house...employ your population?""

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference?

Pride, celebrated as country music's first Black superstar, passed in Dallas, Texas, where he had established his life's second successful act—in real estate and banking.

At Nov. 11's CMA Awards Pride took home the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award and sang ""Kiss An Angel Good Mornin'"" with Jimmie Allen. It was his final performance.

""I’m so heartbroken that one of my dearest and oldest friends, Charley Pride, has passed away,"" Dolly Parton tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""It’s even worse to know that he passed away from COVID-19. What a horrible, horrible virus. Charley, we will always love you.""

Reba McEntire tweeted, ""Charley Pride will always be a legend in Country music. He will truly be missed but will always be remembered for his great music, wonderful personality and his big heart.""

Billy Ray Cyrus called him a ""gentleman... legend and true trail blazer.""

Pride was born a sharecropper’s son in Sledge, Mississippi, joined the Army, worked at a smelting plant, and tried to break into big-league baseball, ending up as a pitcher for a New York Yankees' farm team before an injury sidelined his diamond dreams.

Last year Ken Burns' PBS documentary series ""Country Music"" quoted Pride as saying he was inspired by baseball great Jackie Robinson's major league breakthrough, which influenced his belief the sport could be his ""way out of the cotton field.""

""Charley Pride was a trail blazer whose remarkable voice & generous spirit broke down barriers in country music just as his hero Jackie Robinson had in baseball,"" Burns tweeted Saturday.

Pride moved to Nashville in 1963 to make music. In 1967 his recording of ""Just Between You and Me"" broke in the country Top 10 chart.

His first singles were released without noting that he was Black, and without publicity photos, according to ""Country Music."" As a result, early audiences were sometimes initially shocked into silence.

""Once they heard me sing, [they said], 'I don’t care if he’s green. I like his singing,'"" Pride is quoted as saying.

From then until 1987 he performed on 52 Top 10 hits. He was RCA's top-selling country artist, his representatives said. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2000.

In his memoir, Pride wrote, ""We’re not color blind yet, but we’ve advanced a few paces along the path and I like to think I’ve contributed something to that process.""

2020-12-12 19:02:07+00:00,60,"CHICAGO — Like many Black people in Chicago, Etta Davis is afraid of catching Covid-19. She has a heart condition and diabetes and tries hard to wear her mask and stay safe. Yet, she doesn’t place much hope in the coming vaccine.

She hears city leaders say her community will be prioritized, but as a lower-income, Black woman on the South Side, she says she has good reason to doubt them.

""We're not gonna get it first, we know this,"" she said. ""I'm just keeping it real. Money talks to the people with the money. They’re going to get it first.""

The city of Chicago is gearing up to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine as early as next week, and officials are emphasizing that the process will be free and equitable. But many Black people, who are the most likely to die from the coronavirus, do not believe what they are hearing.

Just as the city is promoting vaccination in lower-income, Black neighborhoods, it is planning the shutdown of Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, a historic teaching hospital beloved by many Black people on the South Side. The coming closure has sparked anger and protests by residents who view the decision as evidence that city leaders and health officials do not care about their access to health care.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Davis said she is struggling to understand how a hospital serving a Black community could close in the middle of a pandemic disproportionately harming it. Black people have accounted for nearly 40 percent of Covid-19-related deaths in Chicago, but they comprise less than a third of the population. That disparity, Black residents said, makes it hard to trust officials who say Black people will receive a safe, equitable vaccine.

At a protest outside Mercy Hospital on Wednesday, Robin Hood, a pastor for Redeemed Outreach Ministries in Chicago, said the closure would sow distrust among community members, who have seen three other hospitals close across the city since 2018.

“They don't trust the government. They watched what happened to hospitals being closed in Chicago over the last 20 years. We've had several hospitals close,” Hood said. “Our communities are always left behind when it comes to the most basic needs, and that's health care.”

Trinity Health, which owns Mercy Hospital, has said the institution is not profitable enough and could close as soon as February. Patients and activists have asked the city to facilitate a sale of the hospital to a new owner who would commit to providing care for poor and Black Chicagoans.

With no current buyer, Mercy Hospital CEO Carol Schneider said the site will be turned into an urgent care center. Before it closes, the hospital will administer the Covid-19 vaccine “so all of us are working together with the city of Chicago to make sure that the vaccine gets to those that need it most as soon as possible.”

Chicagoan Antwain Miller shares Davis’ concern that “everything's about money.”

“I feel like the most disadvantaged folks would be left behind,” said Miller, who attended a protest against the closure and mentioned the long history of medical abuse of Black patients and his distrust of medical providers. “Would they give us the full-fledged vaccine? They might give us a generic version of the vaccine.”

There is no “generic” vaccine and no evidence that Black people will receive anything different than others, but Miller is not alone in wondering if Black people could be harmed or mistreated by providers.

Chicago resident Yolanda Pitts said she and her children will not take the vaccine: “The African American community, we're just not trusting you. Because we do feel like we're the first person that they want to test it on.”

Even residents who are looking forward to taking it do not fault their wary neighbors. Jitu Brown, a born-and-raised South Sider and the national director of the Journey for Justice Alliance, a racial justice group, blamed vaccination failures on politicians who lost the trust of the people they serve.

“Many of these people that beg for folks' votes and talk a progressive talk maintain the status quo. Ignoring community voice is the status quo. Underserving Black and brown communities is not courageous, it’s cowardly,” Brown said. “Be courageous, face this country's ugly and commit to transforming.

2020-12-12 18:20:04+00:00,37,"Hospital systems nationwide should expect the first shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine to arrive Monday, Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said during a media briefing Saturday.

""Boxes are being packed and loaded with vaccine with emphasis on quality control,"" Perna said. Within the next 24 hours, he said, those boxes will move from Pfizer's manufacturing facility to UPS and FedEx hubs, where they will be delivered to 636 predetermined locations nationwide.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Perna said 145 of those sites should receive the vaccine Monday, with the others trickling in through Wednesday. The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine late Friday night.

An estimated 2.9 million doses will be distributed within the first week. That number is expected to ramp up significantly in the coming weeks, to as much as 40 million doses by the end of 2020.

State governors and health departments are in charge of the vaccine distribution to providers. A number of states are expected to start administering the shots simultaneously to both front-line health care workers and long-term care facilities, Perna said.

Less than a day after authorizing the first vaccine to protect against Covid-19, the FDA worked to ease lingering concerns over the possibility of severe allergic reactions to the Pfizer doses.

""We considered the potential allergic reactions carefully,"" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a briefing with reporters Saturday morning. He added that the FDA scientists ""feel comfortable"" telling the American people that unless they have specific allergies to other vaccines or vaccine ingredients, they can get the shot.

Scrutiny of the potential for vaccine-related allergies arose this past week, when the United Kingdom began administering the Pfizer vaccine. Two health care workers experienced serious allergic reactions, prompting British regulators to issue a warning for anyone with a history of severe allergies.

Marks said that after reviewing Pfizer's safety data, the FDA team found no reason to exclude the majority of people with allergies from getting the vaccine.

""About 1.6 percent of the population has had a severe allergic reaction of some sort or another to a food or some environmental aspect,"" Marks said. ""We would really not like to have that many people not be able to receive the vaccine.""

The potential for allergic reactions to vaccines — or any other medication — is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it is standard practice to warn consumers against the potential for allergic reactions to any pharmaceutical. Patients are asked in virtually all doctor visits about a history of drug allergies. And any facility qualified to administer vaccines is equipped with emergency epinephrine (known to many as an EpiPen) in the event of anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction.

Marks said those with a history of allergic reactions should speak with their physician about any Covid-19 vaccine.

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Also Saturday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel recommended the vaccine for people age 16 and up and said pregnant women should consult with their doctors before getting it and people with serious allergic reactions to other vaccines should not get it.

The CDC group also said that the vaccine should be offered to people who have already had Covid, whether they had symptoms or not. The vaccine is also recommended for people with underlying health conditions or with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients or who have a chronic disease.

Medical systems nationwide are already preparing to receive Pfizer's vaccine, which has been shown to be nearly 95 percent effective when given in two doses, about three weeks apart.

Dr. Richard Besser, a former acting director of the CDC and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, offered a reminder that even highly effective vaccines will not be enough to curb the pandemic on their own.

""The potential of this moment to change the course of the pandemic will only be realized if it is accompanied by thoughtful action,"" Besser wrote in a statement to NBC News. ""Individuals must continue to follow proven public health guidance like wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and washing their hands.""

2020-12-12 14:32:02+00:00,36,"The patients who stream into her clinic in a low-income and predominantly Black section of Chicago's South Side have been terrified by the coronavirus pandemic, said Dr. Brittani James, stressed out by its harmful effects on the community and frustrated by mixed messages from government officials.

But now, just as possible solution to the virus's spread is on the horizon, she is particularly worried about what she is hearing from her patients. Many of them fear that the vaccines aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 will be harmful to Black Americans.

Concerns about vaccines have left some Black people entirely unwilling to take a vaccine, while others have said that they want to wait and see how the first wave of vaccine distribution is handled.

When those concerns come up, “I look my patients in the eye and I say that I understand, I’ve read the studies myself, and my job is to protect you and I will not do you wrong,” said James, a family physician who is also an assistant professor at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. “I don’t respond with writing them off as irrational and ignorant.”

As a result of her conversations with patients and her own medical experience, “I’m already seeing the writing on the wall that we are not prepared to roll this vaccine out to vulnerable communities,” said James, who co-founded the Institute for Antiracism in Medicine earlier this year. “I feel like I’m screaming into a void in trying to get people to understand that I can see that this will fail if we continue to do what we normally do with distribution.”

Over the past several months, as infections, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 continue to rise across the country, it is having the harshest effects on Black communities like the one James serves. By almost every metric, be it increased unemployment, diminished academic performance or exposure to pre-existing conditions that put a person at a greater risk of getting sick, the virus and its economic fallout have often affected Black Americans more severely than other groups.

“It’s been very overwhelming,” James said.

The pandemic’s disparate impact has fueled concerns that Black communities — who along with Latinos and Native Americans are among the groups most affected by Covid-19 — are being left behind as America responds to the virus. And with several vaccines likely on the path to federal approval in the near future, ensuring that Black communities and other marginalized groups have access to treatment is something that medical professionals say is crucial to defeating the pandemic.

But right now, the one thing that may be more important than getting vaccines in the hands of Black Americans is increasing their trust in the process that created it, and in a medical system that has mistreated them in both the past and the present.

Generations of experimentation on Black Americans and dismissal at the hands of medical professionals have left many skeptical of the medical field and wary of taking a vaccine, something that just half of Black poll respondents have said they are willing to do.

It’s all part of a cycle of a distrust in medicine that some Black medical providers say is both completely warranted and deeply concerning.

“It is not paranoia, it is not that Black people don’t ‘get it’ or are simply uneducated and unintelligent about their health,” James says. “The reality is that their worries have been earned and will not be corrected until medicine and public health and the government reckon with the past and what has been done to Black and brown people.”

Now, as the country deals with another deadly wave of the coronavirus, Black doctors and medical providers are taking key roles in doing something they say should have been done decades ago: working to build trust in medicine in Black communities and acknowledge past harms. But, increasing confidence in vaccines is just one part of a process they say must continue for years.

Black medical providers aren’t shocked

Polling of Black Americans reveals that months into the pandemic, there continues to be a deep distrust of potential vaccine efforts.

A September survey of Black and Latino respondents published by the COVID Collaborative, the NAACP and UnidosUS found that while 55 percent of Black respondents knew someone who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, just 14 percent said that they believed that a future vaccine would be safe, and only 18 percent believed that the vaccine would be effective.

A December poll from the Pew Research Center found that while 71 percent of Black respondents knew someone who had been hospitalized or died from Covid-19, fewer than half of Black Americans polled would get the vaccine.

For Black medical providers, these numbers are stark, but not surprising.

“We saw early on that vaccine acceptance and willingness to enroll in vaccine clinical trials was going to be a major challenge,” said Dr. Reed Tuckson, a former public health commissioner in Washington, D.C., and the leader of the Black Coalition Against COVID-19, a D.C.-based effort to spread information about the virus and potential vaccines to Black Americans.

Over the past several months, the coalition has worked with a number of Washington community organizations, historically Black colleges and universities, and community leaders to share information both locally and nationally about Covid-19 prevention, and drafted a public “Love Letter to Black America” that calls for people to be open to vaccines when they are available.

Much of the organization’s national work has revolved around combating misinformation about potential vaccines, and the coalition has used radio campaigns to further its reach. The coalition has also worked to make experts available to the general public through remote national town halls and forums, including a recent event that allowed people to hear directly from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.

Tuckson said that the events have largely been a success, adding that the coalition’s first two town hall events reached some 240,000 people. Among Black Americans, “there is a hunger and willingness for information and to engage in these issues when they are presented with the community’s issues in mind,” he said.

Other members of the coalition include the presidents of the National Medical Association, and the National Black Nurses Association, and the leadership of the nation’s four historically-Black medical schools: the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, the Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C., the Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles.

The individual groups within the coalition have also worked to spread information about the vaccine to the communities they serve, and the four medical schools have been involved in the clinical trials process. But these efforts have at times drawn a backlash from alumni and other Black Americans worried that the process would somehow be unsafe.

The doctors argue that their actions will ultimately help Black communities. “We’ve been developing linguistically and culturally appropriate materials to help people to get access to testing and educational material about Covid-19,” Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine, recently told the Undefeated.

Martha Dawson, president of the National Black Nurses Association, said that efforts to increase openness to the vaccine in Black communities must stem from a direct acknowledgement of the ways that Black people have faced discrimination in the medical field, and from an honest and open dialogue that does not dismiss concerns or fears about a vaccine, but instead addresses them clearly and with information.

“Historically, there is a saying that when white people catch a cold, African Americans catch pneumonia,” Dawson said. She explains that any effort to address the pandemic in Black communities must also address what are known as the “social determinants of health” the external factors -- living conditions and economic outcomes that directly affect a person’s health and have played a role in wide health disparities between Black people and white people well before the pandemic began.

“This pandemic should serve as a wake-up call for how fragile our health care system is and that there is room for improvement,” she adds.

The scars of Tuskegee

That improvement isn’t just limited to closing the disparities exacerbated by the coronavirus, experts say. Rather, they also want there to be increased acknowledgement and awareness of a history that is widely known in Black communities and not always shared elsewhere: the history of how racism in medicine has left profound cultural and social scars on Black people and their communities.

This history begins with enslaved men and women being subjected to surgeries without anesthesia in the name of medical advancement. Men like James Marion Sims, who has been celebrated as the “Father of Modern Gynecology,” operated on Black women unable to oppose the treatment. Other stories include cases like that of Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman who went to a segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital for cancer treatment in 1951 only to have her cells taken and used in medical research without her consent for decades after her death.

Perhaps the largest shadow has been cast by the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, which began in the 1930s and continued until its public revelation in 1972. The study, which was conducted in Alabama with approval of the U.S. government, tracked 600 Black men -- 399 living with syphilis and 201 without the disease — but did not offer any treatment, instead observing the men for decades as they struggled with health complications related to the disease, infected others, and died. The study did irreparable damage to the men and their loved ones, and according to research published in 2016, scarred a generation, with life expectancy among Black men over 45 falling in the years immediately following the revelation of the experiment.

The scars of Tuskegee and other historical traumas continue to resonate today, several Black medical providers said, and help explain part of the distrust Black communities have toward the medical field. But another factor that is also significant is how people have been treated in the present, an issue that has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic.

“Black people can’t even get adequate health care and access to insurance,” Dawson said, noting that even when Black patients can access doctors, they report having negative interactions with them and are not always taken seriously when raising concerns about their health.

“When there isn’t a pandemic, if you don’t allow me to fully participate in the health care system, then why in a pandemic are you expecting me to participate in the health care system?” she added. “We can’t keep having it both ways.”

The medical providers all acknowledged that the mistrust and misinformation that they are seeing are issues that can’t be resolved overnight and won’t be fixed in the weeks before vaccines begin to be made available to front-line public health workers, a key group exposed to the virus. But they also acknowledge that the costs of doing nothing are significant and could lead to the further devastation of Black communities.

Dr. Leon McDougle, a Black physician in Columbus, Ohio, and the current president of the National Medical Association, notes that one piece of misinformation he wants to correct is that Covid-19 is only threatening to older patients. During a recent interview, he recalled the story of a 35-year-old patient, a former Division I football player, who needed weeks of treatment for Covid-19 followed by months of dialysis for kidney failure.

“Prior to his illness, he looked like the Incredible Hulk,” McDougle said. He points to the case as an example of the ways that Covid-19 symptoms can linger for months after the treatment. McDougle, who leads a task force of Black physicians that plans to independently vet potential vaccines, also cites the case as an example of why vaccination will be important, noting that avoiding the vaccine could make racial health disparities worse.

Because of this, McDougle said, it is crucial for him to “lead by example,” so he said he has signed up to participate in clinical trials for a vaccine and that he would take a vaccination when it is available. He said he hopes that this pledge, coupled with similar pledges made by other Black doctors, nurses, researchers and pharmacists, can help ease suspicion of Covid-19 vaccines.

Tuckson of the Black Coalition Against COVID-19 is more direct.

“The African American community needs to understand that 2020 is not 1930 or 1940,” he said. “There were no African American physicians or scientists or health policy leaders in the past, today is a different situation,” he added, noting that a series of ethical guidelines in medicine known as the Belmont Report stem directly from the Tuskegee experiment. He also said that numerous Black scientists “will have direct involvement in the creation of a vaccine,” including Black women like Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, a lead coronavirus vaccine researcher at the NIH.

For James, the Chicago doctor, the only way that vaccine conversations will change in Black communities is if Black people not only play a role in creating a vaccine, but they are also given lead roles on sharing vaccine information with the public.

“We need to listen to Black and brown leadership, places like Black churches, nonprofits that understand the communities,” she said. “We need to empower them with resources to execute and follow their lead.”

A letter from the FDA to Pfizer reads that ""the known and potential benefits of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine"" outweigh its potential risks for people ages 16 and older.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""It's nothing short of a medical miracle to have FDA authorization of a vaccine for Covid-19 just over 11 months since the virus was made known to the world,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Friday night.

FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn in a statement called the authorization ""a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world.""

The vaccine, made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, is expected to be shipped nationwide as soon as this weekend, earmarked for front-line health care workers, as well as staff working at long-term care facilities.

The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first #COVID19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world. https://t.co/HP4f5DTFl9 — Dr. Stephen M. Hahn (@SteveFDA) December 12, 2020

Those two groups in Phase 1 of the vaccine rollout together represent around 24 million people — 3 million residents of long-term care facilities and 21 million health care workers on the front lines of treating Covid-19 patients.

""Our teams are engaged and ready to receive it,"" said Onisis Stefas, chief pharmacy officer for Northwell Health in New York, adding that health systems should get about 48 hours notice before shipment.

With the FDA's authorization, shipments of the vaccine are expected to move quickly, so that the first vaccine doses could be administered Monday or Tuesday, an official at HHS confirmed to NBC News on Friday.

Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine has been shown to be both safe and highly effective. Phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine reveal the shot is 95 percent effective across a variety of age and racial groups and ethnicities when given in two doses, about three weeks apart.

Documents released Tuesday revealed that even just one shot may offer about 50 percent immunity, though the FDA said two shots are necessary for maximum protection.

On Thursday, a group of independent advisers to the FDA overwhelmingly voted in favor of the emergency use authorization by the regulatory agency. The FDA predictably followed its panel's advice, authorizing the vaccine the next day.

There were a handful of dissenters among the advisory panel, however, some of whom said there is not enough data to recommend the shots for teens 16 and 17, although there were participants of that age in the clinical trials.

One of those members who voted against advising emergency use was Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School and vice president for medical affairs at Rosalind Franklin University in Chicago.

""We have limited safety and efficacy data on how the vaccine affects the pediatric population,"" Chatterjee wrote in an email to CNBC. ""Since most of them will not be eligible to receive the vaccine in the near future, and because they are not in a high-risk group, I believe we have time to gather and analyze additional data in this and younger age groups.""

Otherwise, Chatterjee said, she supported the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine.

Another member who voted no, Dr. David Kim, director of the vaccines division of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy in the Department of Health and Human Services, told CNBC in an email that he would have voted yes ""most enthusiastically"" had the vote been limited to recommending authorization to those ages 18 and older.

In the end, the FDA determined that the data supported the vaccine's use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals.

As of yet, there is no indication those who've had Covid-19 should not get the vaccine. Covid-19 reinfections are thought to be rare, but if natural antibody levels wane over time, it may be possible for a person to become infected more than once.

The U.S. will be the fourth country to roll out the Pfizer vaccine, after the United Kingdom, Canada and Bahrain.

Potential side effects of the vaccine will be monitored closely. Fever, fatigue, headache and muscle and joint pain may be expected.

""Adverse reactions are not always a bad thing,"" Stefas of Northwell Health, said. ""It shows that your body is reacting to the vaccine, and that your immune response is working.""

Earlier this week, two health care workers in the U.K. experienced serious allergic reactions almost immediately after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, prompting British regulators to warn that people with a history of severe allergic reactions shouldn't receive the vaccine. In the FDA guidance, the agency said that the vaccine should not be given to individuals with ""known history of severe allergic reaction"" or anaphylaxis.

The FDA also cautioned that medical treatment for allergic reactions should be given immediately if an individual experiences an anaphylactic reaction following the Pfizer vaccine.

The FDA advisory panel is scheduled to meet again virtually December 17 to consider a similar vaccine, made by Moderna. In November, the company released preliminary results from its Phase 3 trial, which showed that the vaccine is nearly 95 percent at preventing symptomatic illness.

More details from Moderna are expected to be released publicly before next week's meeting.

The United States on Thursday again broke single-day Covid-19 records for both reported deaths and cases, according to an NBC News' count.

The country saw 229,928 new cases and 3,110 deaths. The previous single-day record was just on Wednesday. The rise in cases in large parts of the country has prompted dire warnings about hospital capacity and whether colder weather and the holiday season will help the virus spread.

On Thursday, Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine got the recommendation from an independent panel of experts that the FDA authorize it for emergency use. The FDA is not obligated to go along with the panel's recommendation, but it is widely expected to authorize the vaccine for emergency use promptly.

But now, just as possible solution to the virus's spread is on the horizon, she is particularly worried about what she is hearing from her patients. Many of them fear that the vaccines aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 will be harmful to Black Americans.

Concerns about vaccines have left some Black people entirely unwilling to take a vaccine, while others have said that they want to wait and see how the first wave of vaccine distribution is handled.

When those concerns come up, “I look my patients in the eye and I say that I understand, I’ve read the studies myself, and my job is to protect you and I will not do you wrong,” said James, a family physician who is also an assistant professor at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. “I don’t respond with writing them off as irrational and ignorant.”

As a result of her conversations with patients and her own medical experience, “I’m already seeing the writing on the wall that we are not prepared to roll this vaccine out to vulnerable communities,” said James, who co-founded the Institute for Antiracism in Medicine earlier this year. “I feel like I’m screaming into a void in trying to get people to understand that I can see that this will fail if we continue to do what we normally do with distribution.”

Over the past several months, as infections, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 continue to rise across the country, it is having the harshest effects on Black communities like the one James serves. By almost every metric, be it increased unemployment, diminished academic performance or exposure to pre-existing conditions that put a person at a greater risk of getting sick, the virus and its economic fallout have often affected Black Americans more severely than other groups.

“It’s been very overwhelming,” James said.

The pandemic’s disparate impact has fueled concerns that Black communities — who along with Latinos and Native Americans are among the groups most affected by Covid-19 — are being left behind as America responds to the virus. And with several vaccines likely on the path to federal approval in the near future, ensuring that Black communities and other marginalized groups have access to treatment is something that medical professionals say is crucial to defeating the pandemic.

But right now, the one thing that may be more important than getting vaccines in the hands of Black Americans is increasing their trust in the process that created it, and in a medical system that has mistreated them in both the past and the present.

“The African American community needs to understand that 2020 is not 1930 or 1940,” he said. “There were no African American physicians or scientists or health policy leaders in the past, today is a different situation,” he added, noting that a series of ethical guidelines in medicine known as the Belmont Report stem directly from the Tuskegee experiment. He also said that numerous Black scientists “will have direct involvement in the creation of a vaccine,” including Black women like Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, a lead coronavirus vaccine researcher at the NIH.

For James, the Chicago doctor, the only way that vaccine conversations will change in Black communities is if Black people not only play a role in creating a vaccine, but they are also given lead roles on sharing vaccine information with the public.

“We need to listen to Black and brown leadership, places like Black churches, nonprofits that understand the communities,” she said. “We need to empower them with resources to execute and follow their lead.”

2020-12-09 21:44:03+00:00,52,"For 18 days after Erika Becerra gave birth, she fought for her life, hooked up to a ventilator in a Detroit hospital.

Diagnosed with Covid-19 on Nov. 7 at just shy of nine months pregnant, Becerra, 33, was otherwise healthy, relatives said, and excited to welcome her second child.

Initially, her coronavirus symptoms were manageable at home: body aches and some tightness in her chest, Claudia Garcia, Becerra’s aunt and godmother, said.

But then, Becerra started having problems breathing, and her husband, a landscaper, rushed her to the hospital by ambulance. With her condition worsening by the day, doctors opted to induce Becerra on Nov. 15, a couple weeks before her due date, Garcia said.

Becerra’s son, Diego, was born healthy. But chaos followed his birth: Becerra’s oxygen level plummeted, the doctors at Henry Ford Hospital told Garcia. Instead of getting to cradle her baby boy, Becerra had to be intubated.

She never got the chance to hold her newborn, according to her distraught family. At one point, hospital staff brought the baby close to her cheek so he could sense his mother’s presence, a doctor told Garcia, but family members do not know if Becerra was aware that Diego was there.

While Becerra was initially responsive with eye and hand movements in the first several days that she was intubated, her condition deteriorated. On Dec. 3, she died.

“I am speechless when it comes to the reality of this,” Garcia, 41, told NBC News. “We want to make sure everybody understands the tragic consequences of this damn virus. I don’t want anyone to suffer this pain.”

""We want to make sure everybody understands the tragic consequences of this damn virus.""

Becerra had recently moved to Detroit from her hometown of East Los Angeles and was a stay-at-home mom to a daughter who turned one year old while Becerra was on the ventilator.

Garcia, who lives in Fontana, California, spoke with Becerra’s doctors daily and relayed the information to Becerra’s Spanish-speaking husband and parents. Every time the phone rang, Garcia jumped, fearful it would be bad news.

She said Becerra’s death has stunned her close-knit family. Becerra was “happy — so, so, happy” to bring a little boy into her family, Garcia said. Diego was named after his father, Diego Becerra, while the couple’s first child, Erika Guadalupe, was named after her. Becerra nicknamed her daughter Lupita.

Her family described Becerra as selfless and caring.

“Erika was the most wonderful person you could ever meet,” Miguel Avilez, her brother, told CNN this week through tears. “For her, other people’s happiness was her happiness.”

Becerra’s family does not know where she got the coronavirus, but believes it was during a hospital visit she had made when she started having preterm contractions. Doctors have told her family that her death was due to the coronavirus, not any complications of pregnancy or delivery, according to Garcia. (Henry Ford Health System in Detroit declined to comment, citing patient privacy laws.)

An uncommon phenomenon in pregnant women

Deaths of pregnant women due to Covid-19 are uncommon, but not unheard of, said Dr. Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California at San Francisco.

“We know that most have very mild cases or asymptomatic cases that don’t require hospitalization,” she said. “But we also know that if you do require hospitalization for Covid, you’re more likely to get very sick, and sicker compared to if you weren’t pregnant compared to women of the same age.”

Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added pregnancy to a list of conditions that carry a higher chance of severe or fatal complications from Covid-19, based on a large study of pregnant women that found that they faced a 70 percent increased risk of death compared to symptomatic women who were not pregnant.

Still, Gaw said the overall risk of death remains low for pregnant women with the coronavirus.

“You’re at higher risk of getting very sick, but most don’t get very sick, fortunately.”

“You’re at higher risk of getting very sick, but most don’t get very sick, fortunately,” she said. Nonetheless, pregnant women should take measures such as wearing a mask, social distancing, washing their hands well and “being really selective about who you interact with closely” to reduce their chances of catching the coronavirus, she said.

Becerra took all those steps and still fell ill, Garcia said. Her death comes as the United States is seeing a record uptick in confirmed Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and fatalities.

The virus has struck minorities, including the Latino community, disproportionately hard. Garcia urged fellow Latinos to take the illness seriously.

“Not everyone makes it,” she said.

No one else in Becerra’s family tested positive for the coronavirus, including Diego, who was monitored for several days at the hospital after he was born. The newborn and his sister are being cared for by their father and Becerra’s parents, who flew to Detroit from California to sit by her hospital bedside for her final moments. Over FaceTime, Garcia got to say goodbye, too.

Becerra’s family plans to hold a small memorial service in Detroit. Garcia started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the funeral; as of Wednesday afternoon, more than $86,000 in donations had poured in, mostly from strangers. Garcia said she was overwhelmed by the generosity.

“We come from a very, very humble background,” Garcia said. “We don’t ask for much. She doesn’t ask for much.”

Becerra’s family will put the overflow of donations toward raising her children. Garcia plans to tell the kids all about their mother as they get older: how Becerra would lovingly rub her pregnant belly with Diego inside; how she would gently play with Lupita; and how everyone she met fell in love with her “beautiful soul.”

“I’m going to make sure their Mommy stays alive in their heart forever,” Garcia said. “They are going to know who their mom was.”",MSNBC,"['hospital', 'becerras', 'sick', 'pregnant', 'covid19', 'garcia', 'family', 'wait', 'becerra', 'told', 'diego', 'child', 'mother', 'welcome', 'couldnt', 'women', 'killed', 'baby', 'second', 'hold']",0

It’s time to consider that there is, in fact, a politician willing to inflict more pain and suffering on Americans than President Donald Trump. And his name is Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.

The Senate Majority Leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than died in the Twin Towers.

Today, McConnell is the grim reaper in a much more literal sense. As Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., summed it up: ""Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession,"" he tweeted in the wake of yet another awful set of unemployment numbers. ""One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell's political games are costing lives and livelihoods.""

Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession. One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell’s political games are costing lives and livelihoods. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) December 4, 2020

This is not mere partisan hyperbole. The Senate majority leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than those who died in the terror attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center; as 1 in 8 Americans go hungry; as millions of Americans enter permanent unemployment.

What does McConnell offer them? A “skinny” stimulus bill, consisting of a mere $500 billion in aid, when the near-consensus view among top economists is that it needs to be at least $2 trillion. Skinny? Try “emaciated,” as Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put it in September. In October, when the Trump administration tried to reach a $1.8 trillion compromise with congressional Democrats, it was McConnell who shot it down.

But he was unshaken; $500 billion, he intoned. Not a penny more.

McConnell’s refusal to authorize further government spending in the midst of this crisis has had — and will continue to have — deadly consequences. We learned this the hard way after the 2008 financial crash.

A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal found that the “squeeze on public finances” in the wake of the crash was “linked to nearly 120,000 excess deaths in England.” A 2014 study in the British Journal of Psychiatry found the Great Recession led to more than 10,000 added suicides in Europe and North America. “Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death,” wrote sociologist David Stuckler and epidemiologist Sanjay Basu, co-authors of the book, “The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills,” in 2013. “What we have found is that austerity — severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending — is not only self-defeating, but fatal.”

The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but the worst health crisis since the Spanish Flu.

Today, state and local governments are on their knees and begging for federal aid. So, too, are health care workers, as hospitals hit breaking point. Come the end of this month, as various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expire, millions of gig workers, freelancers, and long-term unemployed will lose their unemployment benefits; millions of renters will lose their homes as the nationwide eviction moratorium ends; tens of millions of borrowers will have to restart their student loan payments.

""All of this beyond outrageous. It should infuriate us all. We often say the United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Well what is the point...if you then say you cant afford to feed...house...employ your population?""



I got angry on the @mehdihasanshow: pic.twitter.com/Mh0ykIQIAi — Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) December 3, 2020

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference? The Senate majority leader is neither the architect of an illegal war, nor the former leader of a terrorist group.

So naturally, the Trump administration thought this would be the perfect time to reject science-based restrictions on a deadly air pollutant known for lodging itself deep in the lungs and infiltrating the bloodstream.

In 2019, the EPA’s own staff scientists said tightening the standard would save roughly 12,200 lives annually.

On Monday, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency made its latest Big Tobacco-like move in the war on public health when it declined to raise air quality standards for fine particulate matter. The decision flies in the face of mounting scientific evidence that air pollution is worsening the pandemic — not just by exacerbating the severity of Covid-19 symptoms, but by transporting the virus at greater distances through the air.

Public health experts have been recommending that the EPA further restrict air pollution for years. Specifically, they’ve recommended reducing fine particulates, tiny dust specks about one-thirtieth the size of a human hair that make up about 90 percent of all U.S. air pollution. These specks are well known for triggering asthma, heart problems and about 100,000 deaths a year in the U.S.

In 2019, the EPA’s own staff scientists agreed, and said tightening the standard would save roughly 12,200 lives annually. But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, said Monday that none of this evidence is enough to justify reducing pollution. “Every scientist can take a look at this and reach a different conclusion,” he said. His conclusion is that there are still “uncertainties in the evidence for adverse health effects” from the current pollution regulations.

For decades, the tobacco industry cited “uncertainty” in the science to deny the dangers of secondhand smoke and delay public health regulations.

This is a stunning rejection of modern air-pollution science, which for decades has operated under a consensus that there is no safe level of fine particle exposure for Americans. But it also represents a common rhetorical tactic among those who want to reject scientific evidence about the dangers of a pollutant or product in order to continue producing it. This tactic exploits the language of “scientific uncertainty” — which exists in the discussion of every single scientific topic, even gravity — in order to convince the public that we just don’t know enough to act.

For decades, the tobacco industry cited “uncertainty” in the science to deny the dangers of secondhand smoke and delay public health regulations. At the same time, corporations tried to prevent more evidence from coming forward. One way they did this was by pushing for scientific “transparency” rules, which would prohibit the government from using research based on confidential human health data. Spoiler alert: All of the research that shows smoking harms human health is based on confidential human health data.

The EPA has been doing the exact same thing for the last four years when it comes to air pollution. Not only has Wheeler misleadingly claimed “uncertainty” in air pollution science to justify deregulating polluters, he’s also pushed for rules that would limit the type of science the EPA can use to justify pollution regulations. In addition, Wheeler’s EPA has systematically neglected the U.S. air pollution monitoring network, “leaving tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to undetected bad air quality from events like wildfires to industrial pollution,” according to a recent Reuters investigation.

This Big Tobacco-approach isn’t limited to air pollution, either. Denial and suppression of scientific evidence is central to Trump’s response to climate change, and it’s central to his response to the coronavirus. Indeed, when Trump leaves office in 42 days, his legacy will not just have been that he presided over the rollback of more than 125 climate and environmental policies. It will be that he cemented Big Tobacco-style science denial as the backbone of Republican public health policy.

The effect of this legacy is not just that people will get sick and die. It’s that people will get sick or die, and their loved ones will not be able to seek redress, because there will never be sufficient evidence of their suffering.

So naturally, the Trump administration thought this would be the perfect time to reject science-based restrictions on a deadly air pollutant known for lodging itself deep in the lungs and infiltrating the bloodstream.

In 2019, the EPA’s own staff scientists said tightening the standard would save roughly 12,200 lives annually.

On Monday, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency made its latest Big Tobacco-like move in the war on public health when it declined to raise air quality standards for fine particulate matter. The decision flies in the face of mounting scientific evidence that air pollution is worsening the pandemic — not just by exacerbating the severity of Covid-19 symptoms, but by transporting the virus at greater distances through the air.

Public health experts have been recommending that the EPA further restrict air pollution for years. Specifically, they’ve recommended reducing fine particulates, tiny dust specks about one-thirtieth the size of a human hair that make up about 90 percent of all U.S. air pollution. These specks are well known for triggering asthma, heart problems and about 100,000 deaths a year in the U.S.

In 2019, the EPA’s own staff scientists agreed, and said tightening the standard would save roughly 12,200 lives annually. But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, said Monday that none of this evidence is enough to justify reducing pollution. “Every scientist can take a look at this and reach a different conclusion,” he said. His conclusion is that there are still “uncertainties in the evidence for adverse health effects” from the current pollution regulations.

This is a stunning rejection of modern air-pollution science, which for decades has operated under a consensus that there is no safe level of fine particle exposure for Americans.

It’s time to consider that there is, in fact, a politician willing to inflict more pain and suffering on Americans than President Donald Trump. And his name is Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.

The Senate Majority Leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than died in the Twin Towers.

Today, McConnell is the grim reaper in a much more literal sense. As Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., summed it up: ""Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession,"" he tweeted in the wake of yet another awful set of unemployment numbers. ""One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell's political games are costing lives and livelihoods.""

Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession. One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell’s political games are costing lives and livelihoods. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) December 4, 2020

This is not mere partisan hyperbole. The Senate majority leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than those who died in the terror attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center; as 1 in 8 Americans go hungry; as millions of Americans enter permanent unemployment.

What does McConnell offer them? A “skinny” stimulus bill, consisting of a mere $500 billion in aid, when the near-consensus view among top economists is that it needs to be at least $2 trillion. Skinny? Try “emaciated,” as Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put it in September. In October, when the Trump administration tried to reach a $1.8 trillion compromise with congressional Democrats, it was McConnell who shot it down.

But he was unshaken; $500 billion, he intoned. Not a penny more.

McConnell’s refusal to authorize further government spending in the midst of this crisis has had — and will continue to have — deadly consequences. We learned this the hard way after the 2008 financial crash.

A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal found that the “squeeze on public finances” in the wake of the crash was “linked to nearly 120,000 excess deaths in England.” A 2014 study in the British Journal of Psychiatry found the Great Recession led to more than 10,000 added suicides in Europe and North America. “Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death,” wrote sociologist David Stuckler and epidemiologist Sanjay Basu, co-authors of the book, “The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills,” in 2013. “What we have found is that austerity — severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending — is not only self-defeating, but fatal.”

The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but the worst health crisis since the Spanish Flu.

Today, state and local governments are on their knees and begging for federal aid. So, too, are health care workers, as hospitals hit breaking point. Come the end of this month, as various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expire, millions of gig workers, freelancers, and long-term unemployed will lose their unemployment benefits; millions of renters will lose their homes as the nationwide eviction moratorium ends; tens of millions of borrowers will have to restart their student loan payments.

""All of this beyond outrageous. It should infuriate us all. We often say the United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Well what is the point...if you then say you cant afford to feed...house...employ your population?""

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference? The Senate majority leader is neither the architect of an illegal war, nor the former leader of a terrorist group.

The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Melania ""doesn't shake in her boots ever and she tells Donald exactly how she feels,"" says Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of the First Lady and ex-East Wing adviser.

She believes ""if he's going to do it, he better do it right and he better do it with brass knuckles."" pic.twitter.com/biXV2SmbBE — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) October 2, 2020

We got precious little time to savor the audio before the 2020 news cyclone swept it away. Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.

ok, FINE, we'll auto-tune the ""Christmas stuff"" thing into a carol 🎅🎄🦌 pic.twitter.com/VEprOK3QOP — The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) October 2, 2020

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Ah well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas — at least for a while.

It’s probably for the best that you try to forget that a vaccine has been discovered at all. At least for a while.

I repeat: You will not benefit from the vaccine directly for a good long while, because ""a vaccine is approved"" isn't the same as ""the pandemic is over.""

I know it's hard to accept. I get it. We've been stuck in purgatory for months, unable to plan for — or even picture — the future. The pandemic has kept us unsure about when — or whether — things will ever be normal again.

With news of an imminent vaccine, the fog is starting to clear. It's easy to make the mental leap that since things will be much better soon, the danger has abated now. As that's not the case, it's probably for the best that you try to forget that a vaccine has been discovered at all. At least for a while.

I don't mean for this to come across as yet more doom and gloom about Covid-19. On the contrary, it truly is borderline miraculous that we've got multiple candidates for a vaccine less than a year after the coronavirus's existence was first reported to the World Health Organization. And there won't be much longer to wait before the first rounds of the vaccine are distributed. The Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee focused on vaccines is set to meet Thursday to discuss Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization to get its product approved for the market. It will meet again to discuss a similar request from Moderna a week later.

But there's a bit of a supply-and-demand problem here. The demand is 330 million Americans. The supply is … not that. Not yet, anyway. Pfizer had to roll back its initial plan to pump out enough of its vaccine for 50 million people before the end of the year, The Wall Street Journal reported — instead, the company announced that it will be producing enough for 25 million people. (It still expects to produce enough vaccine for over half a billion people in 2021, though.)

Even if the vaccine were ready for every man, woman and child today, the line to get vaccinated is already lengthy.

The pharmaceutical giant blamed the setback on issues within the supply chain, a constant refrain that has made life that much harder for medical professionals. ""We were late,"" a person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine told The Journal. ""Some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards. We fixed it but ran out of time to meet this year's projected shipments.""

The Trump administration has put in an order for 100 million doses from Pfizer, enough for 50 million people — but The New York Times revealed Monday that the administration had passed on purchasing more of the vaccine when it was offered the chance in the summer. That means that because of the company's commitments to other countries, it may be as late as May before the Biden administration even has the chance to buy more.

Moderna, on the other hand, predicts that it will have made 500 million to 1 billion doses of its two-shot vaccine by the end of 2021 — but it will have just enough doses for about 10 million people in December. (As The Washington Post points out, Moderna has never had a product on the market before, so there's not exactly a guarantee it hits those goals.)

Even if the vaccine were ready for every man, woman and child today, the line to get vaccinated is already lengthy. Doctors and other health-care workers are predicted to receive the first doses because of their constant exposure to people who've tested positive for the coronavirus.

2020-12-08 17:31:05+00:00,122,"A former Alabama state senator died of Covid-19 last week at age 78, officials said.

The former senator, Larry Dixon, a Republican who was also a former executive director of the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, died Friday, the board said in a statement.

Dr. David Thrasher, a pulmonologist in Montgomery who was a close friend of Dixon's, said Dixon's wife, Gaynell Dixon, told him that her husband's last words to her were a prescient warning to the people of Alabama.

""We messed up. We let our guard down,"" Dixon said, according to Thrasher. ""Please tell everybody to be careful. This is real, and if you get diagnosed, get help immediately.""

Thrasher said Dixon was exposed to the virus at a social gathering ""with a couple of guys"" that was hosted outside about two weeks ago.

Thrasher said he was unsure how many people attended, but he said he knew of two other men who attended and had tested positive.

Thrasher said he treated Dixon for early Covid-19 symptoms a few days after the gathering. As his condition worsened, Dixon was placed on a ventilator, Thrasher said.

Gaynell Dixon also tested positive last week and is still recovering, Thrasher said.

Thrasher said Dixon's two daughters contracted the virus this year but recovered and have not been reinfected since their parents' diagnoses.

Dixon, a Republican, represented Senate District 25, which covers Montgomery, Ellmore and Crenshaw counties, from 1983 until he retired in 2010.

Before his Senate service, Dixon was a member of the state House from 1978 to 1982 and a member of the Montgomery City Council from 1975 to 1978.

In a statement published Monday in the Alabama Daily News, Perry Hooper, a former state representative and member of the State Republican Executive Committee, wrote that he was ""still in shock"" over Dixon's death.

""Larry, although not a Montgomery native, loved his adopted hometown as much as anyone,"" Hooper said. ""He devoted his life to service to this great city. He was a great legislator, a man of great moral character, and a devoted and loving husband and father.""

The Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, which issues licenses for medical practitioners, said Friday that it was ""forever grateful"" for Dixon's 35 years as executive director.

""He set an incredible example of service for us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Gaynell, and his family during this difficult time,"" the board members said in a statement.

Alabama has set state records for hospitalization rates and numbers of new Covid-19 cases.

As of Monday, the state had recorded almost 270,000 Covid-19 infections and 3,889 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. State residents have tested positive at a rate of 34.7 percent over the past seven days — one of the highest rates in the country.

Thrasher said Dixon was the ""finest human being,"" whose last wish was to prevent more Alabamians from following his fate.

""He wanted to encourage people to be careful, wear a mask, don't socially gather,"" Thrasher said. ""He said, 'Let's save some lives.'""",MSNBC,"['warns', 'covid19', 'dies', 'board', '78', 'alabama', 'service', 'dixons', 'thrasher', 'words', 'senator', 'covid', 'dixon', 'tested', 'state', 'montgomery', 'messed']",0

I repeat: You will not benefit from the vaccine directly for a good long while, because ""a vaccine is approved"" isn't the same as ""the pandemic is over.""

I know it's hard to accept. I get it. We've been stuck in purgatory for months, unable to plan for — or even picture — the future. The pandemic has kept us unsure about when — or whether — things will ever be normal again.

I don't mean for this to come across as yet more doom and gloom about Covid-19.

The Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee focused on vaccines is set to meet Thursday to discuss Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization to get its product approved for the market. It will meet again to discuss a similar request from Moderna a week later.

But there's a bit of a supply-and-demand problem here. The demand is 330 million Americans. The supply is … not that. Not yet, anyway. Pfizer had to roll back its initial plan to pump out enough of its vaccine for 50 million people before the end of the year, The Wall Street Journal reported — instead, the company announced that it will be producing enough for 25 million people. (It still expects to produce enough vaccine for over half a billion people in 2021, though.)

Even if the vaccine were ready for every man, woman and child today, the line to get vaccinated is already lengthy.

The pharmaceutical giant blamed the setback on issues within the supply chain, a constant refrain that has made life that much harder for medical professionals. ""We were late,"" a person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine told The Journal. ""Some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards. We fixed it but ran out of time to meet this year's projected shipments.""

The Trump administration has put in an order for 100 million doses from Pfizer, enough for 50 million people — but The New York Times revealed Monday that the administration had passed on purchasing more of the vaccine when it was offered the chance in the summer. That means that because of the company's commitments to other countries, it may be as late as May before the Biden administration even has the chance to buy more.

Moderna, on the other hand, predicts that it will have made 500 million to 1 billion doses of its two-shot vaccine by the end of 2021 — but it will have just enough doses for about 10 million people in December. (As The Washington Post points out, Moderna has never had a product on the market before, so there's not exactly a guarantee it hits those goals.)

The information was made public before a meeting Thursday of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC — an advisory group to the FDA that will vote on whether to advise the agency to grant emergency use authorization of the vaccine in the U.S.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The 53-page document contains analysis from both federal regulators and Pfizer on the latest data from the company's Phase 3 clinical trial on its Covid-19 vaccine. It will be used to help guide the advisory group in its decision-making.

""I think we can be confident in the findings of this trial,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director for the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health International Vaccine Access Center, said. Moss noted the diversity of the trial participants, with ""representation across ethnic and racial groups, comorbidities and age.""

Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, said that based on the information provided in the document, he could ""see absolutely no reason why this emergency use authorization would not be granted."" Neither Poland nor Moss is involved in Pfizer's vaccine trials.

The Pfizer vaccine calls for two doses, three weeks apart. In November, Pfizer said early results from its Phase 3 clinical trials showed that two doses appeared to be 95 percent effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19.

The new information shows it has benefits even after the first dose, with an effectiveness of more than 50 percent about a week later. While useful, Poland said it will be important to follow through with that second dose to ""significantly boost the immune response.""

""The concern is that after a single dose, people would think 'I'm home free.' That would be the wrong message,"" Poland said.

The vaccine's overall effectiveness seems to be the same across all age groups, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with underlying conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.

Both Poland and Moss called the data ""a grand slam.""

""We do not have good examples of vaccines with this level of efficacy across age, gender, race and comorbidities,"" Poland said. ""I've never seen something like this.""

It's important to note that the shots may come with side effects, including fatigue, fever, headaches, muscle and joint pain.

Four cases of Bell's palsy, a condition that causes weakness in the facial muscles, were identified in participants who received the vaccine, and none in the group who got the placebo. At least one of the patients recovered within a few days of getting the shot.

There is no evidence the vaccine caused the problem, but FDA is expected to recommend long-term follow-up of this potential issue.

Experts note it will also be important to study the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as those who have compromised immune systems.

Moss pointed out several other unanswered questions.

""Can people who are vaccinated get asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus? That's important,"" he said, adding it's also unclear how long protection lasts after both the first and second doses of vaccine.

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech expect to have 50 million doses available this year and 1.3 billion in 2021, using facilities both in the United States and Belgium.

The United Kingdom was first to roll out the Pfizer vaccine, with a 90-year-old woman near London receiving the first shot Tuesday morning.

Then will likely come nursing home residents, first responders, people with health risks associated with Covid-19, essential workers and on and on until you get to the rest of the population.

The Times published a helpful tool for people to check where in line they might fall based on where they live and other factors, such as age, vulnerability and other data. The results were definitely illuminating. (According to this projection, I should be braced to be behind about 1.5 million people here in New York City.)

Estimates now indicate that there may not be enough vaccine for the general public until May or June — and that was before the news that the government may have problems ordering more from Pfizer. That hasn't stopped people from already asking their doctors when they can get vaccinated. New York University's Langone Hospital had to send out a text Monday saying that, essentially, its patients' guesses were as good as its was.

All of this speaks to how confusing some of the discourse around Covid-19 vaccines has been. President Donald Trump insisted repeatedly during his re-election campaign that a vaccine would be available by the Nov. 3 election, implying that it would be distributed to all Americans at the same time. The Trump administration's political appointees are still highlighting the bright side of things, claiming that up to 24 million people will be vaccinated by mid-January.

""Within 24 hours of FDA greenlighting with authorization, we'll ship to all of the states and territories that we work with. And within hours, they can be vaccinating,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

That doesn't quite track with what health experts told The Times, which said the timeline the administration had laid out ""was uncompromising and did not account for the possibility of delay during the many steps from vaccine manufacture to distribution at state and local levels, not to mention the hesitancy that many people might feel about taking a newly approved vaccine.""

The uncertainty of just when everyone will be able to get vaccinated has bumped up hard against our brains, which have already been struggling with trying to make sense of the world since it was set on pause in the spring. New Yorker staff writer Helen Rosner tweeted out an apt description for the state of play in May, calling it ""an infinite present.""

Today in therapy we talked about how (for those of us currently healthy and taking isolation seriously) right now we live in an infinite present. No future plans, no anticipation of travel or shows or events or celebrations. It’s an endless today, never tomorrow. — Helen Rosner (@hels) May 13, 2020

Wired magazine had Kate Sweeny, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, explain the anxiety the pandemic produces: ""Waiting periods are marked by two existentially challenging states: We don't know what's coming, and we can't do much about it. Together, those states are a recipe for anxiety and worry. People would often rather deal with the certainty of bad news than the anxiety of remaining in limbo.""

The news that a vaccine is coming helps burst that bubble. Suddenly, there's hope on the horizon, and the present can finally turn into the past. But the truth is that the world outside your home will be no safer the day after the FDA approves whichever of the vaccines it greenlights. Dr. Anthony Fauci tried to make that clear on CNN's ""New Day,"" saying there won't be an immediate impact on the still-rising mortality rate for at least several weeks after the mass vaccination campaign really gets underway.

The Covid-19 vaccine will not show an impact on mortality rate immediately, Dr. Anthony Fauci says.



“[It’s] likely you’re not going to see a measurable diminution for at least several weeks, if not longer. But it will come, I guarantee you.” pic.twitter.com/ofotpjqHyb — New Day (@NewDay) December 7, 2020

And all that doesn't mean the pandemic is over. We still need to see whether, as Fauci said, people who are immune to the virus can still spread it after being vaccinated. Which means that until you and everyone you know has had both shots, it's probably best that you take the fact that a vaccine exists at all and lock it up in the back of your head. Instead, keep acting as though it's still dangerous to see your friends and families as we head into the Christmas season.

The Senate Majority Leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than died in the Twin Towers.

Today, McConnell is the grim reaper in a much more literal sense. As Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., summed it up: ""Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession,"" he tweeted in the wake of yet another awful set of unemployment numbers. ""One person is standing in the way.

Congress knows how to help workers and families. It knows how to prevent the looming recession. One person is standing in the way. Mitch McConnell’s political games are costing lives and livelihoods. — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) December 4, 2020

This is not mere partisan hyperbole. The Senate majority leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than those who died in the terror attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center; as 1 in 8 Americans go hungry; as millions of Americans enter permanent unemployment.

What does McConnell offer them? A “skinny” stimulus bill, consisting of a mere $500 billion in aid, when the near-consensus view among top economists is that it needs to be at least $2 trillion. Skinny? Try “emaciated,” as Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put it in September. In October, when the Trump administration tried to reach a $1.8 trillion compromise with congressional Democrats, it was McConnell who shot it down.

But he was unshaken; $500 billion, he intoned. Not a penny more.

McConnell’s refusal to authorize further government spending in the midst of this crisis has had — and will continue to have — deadly consequences. We learned this the hard way after the 2008 financial crash.

A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal found that the “squeeze on public finances” in the wake of the crash was “linked to nearly 120,000 excess deaths in England.” A 2014 study in the British Journal of Psychiatry found the Great Recession led to more than 10,000 added suicides in Europe and North America. “Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death,” wrote sociologist David Stuckler and epidemiologist Sanjay Basu, co-authors of the book, “The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills,” in 2013. “What we have found is that austerity — severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending — is not only self-defeating, but fatal.”

The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but the worst health crisis since the Spanish Flu.

Today, state and local governments are on their knees and begging for federal aid. So, too, are health care workers, as hospitals hit breaking point. Come the end of this month, as various provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expire, millions of gig workers, freelancers, and long-term unemployed will lose their unemployment benefits; millions of renters will lose their homes as the nationwide eviction moratorium ends; tens of millions of borrowers will have to restart their student loan payments.

""All of this beyond outrageous. It should infuriate us all. We often say the United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Well what is the point...if you then say you cant afford to feed...house...employ your population?""

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference?

2020-12-08 08:10:01+00:00,61,"LONDON — At 6.31 a.m. on Tuesday, 334 days after the first reported Covid-19 death in China, Margaret Keenan, 90, became the first person in the world to receive a clinically approved vaccine.

It was a landmark moment in the global fight against the most destructive pandemic in 100 years. In approving and delivering the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, Britain is forging a path that will likely be followed by the United States and Europe in the coming weeks.

""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19,"" said Keenan, who was given the vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry, a city northwest of London.

For all the buildup, it was a shot like any other. Nurse May Parsons asked Keenan to ""relax your arm for me,"" before inserting the needle and finishing with a reassuring but routine ""all done."" Then came the volley of camera flashes and applause.

""It's the best early birthday present I could wish for,"" Keenan, a grandmother of four who turns 91 next week, told reporters. ""It means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.""

""My advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it,"" she said. ""If I can do it, so can you.""

For many, seeing these shots injected into Britons' shoulder muscles will come as a much-needed morale boost at the end of a hellish year globally — one that's seen 1.5 million people killed, 65 million others sickened, and countless more subjected to economic hardship.

Symbolism aside, the reality is that even wealthy countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom face an enormous logistical challenge in trying to vaccinate priority groups — let alone everyone else.

""This feels like the beginning of the end,"" professor Stephen Powis, the National Health Service’s national medical director, said Sunday ahead of the rollout. ""But, of course, it is a marathon, not a sprint, and it will take many months to vaccinate everybody who needs vaccination.""

NHS England Chief Executive Sir Simon Stevens added, ""Less than a year after the first case of this new disease was diagnosed, the NHS has now delivered the first clinically approved Covid-19 vaccination — that is a remarkable achievement.""

Americans will likely not be far behind, with the Food and Drug Administration expected to meet in days to discuss BioNTech-Pfizer's application for emergency use authorization. Next week, the FDA will meet to rule on another vaccine, made by Moderna.

The Chinese and the Russian governments have given emergency approval to several of their vaccines. But these are all still going through Phase 3 trials or have scant publicly released data.

In Britain, with a population of some 67 million, the rollout is the start of the biggest and most challenging vaccination program in the history of the publicly funded National Health Service.

It has purchased 40 million doses. But the first batch delivered from Pfizer's plant in Belgium only contains around 800,000 — enough for 400,000 people taking two doses each.

It needs to be kept at supercold temperatures and handled with extreme care, so its rollout will be limited to 50 hospital ""hubs"" where there is specialist storage equipment.

First in line will be anyone over the age of 80 who is already in hospital.

Keenan, known to friends as ""Maggie,"" is a retired jewelry shop worker who's lived in Coventry for 60 years and grew up in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Like many seniors she's been isolating for most of this year.

""It's a huge honor to be the first person in the country to deliver a Covid-19 jab to a patient,"" said Parsons, a nurse who has worked for the NHS for 24 years and is originally from the Philippines. ""I'm just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day.""

The second patient to receive the vaccine at the hospital was named William Shakespeare, a detail that soon became the top trending topic on Twitter, where people traded puns such as ""The Taming of the Flu"" and ""The Two Gentlemen of Corona"" — references to works by the playwright.

The vaccinations will earn a line in the history books for Coventry, a former industrial powerhouse that endured heavy bombardment in World War II and the shuttering of its auto plants that once earned it the title of Britain's ""motor city.""

Nursing home staff and some front-line health care workers will also get the vaccines, although exactly who makes the initial cut has already prompted heated debate in what has often been a vague and seemingly disorganized process.

It's also been impossible to disentangle what should be a global fight from the impulses of national politics. Critics accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government, which is simultaneously trying to negotiate a Brexit deal, of using its world-first vaccine announcement to promote nationalist or even jingoistic politics.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said last week that Britain's rapid vaccine approval showed the U.K. is ""a much better country"" than the U.S., France and Belgium. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock has dubbed Tuesday as ""V Day"" — short for Vaccine Day, but also referencing ""V-E Day,"" which marked the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945.

Some experts worry that the news will cause people to become complacent, compounding an already tough winter of restrictions, economic pain and the grim routine of daily death tolls.

""No one can discount the importance of the hope that this rollout will generate,"" Mukesh Kapila, a former adviser to the World Health Organization's director general, said. ""But it isn't going to mean we can stop lockdown restrictions anytime soon.""

Meanwhile, Covid-19 is killing more people than ever — the U.S. averaged 1,826 daily deaths last week, one every 45 seconds. Europe's cases have slowed following widespread lockdown restrictions, but still places such as the United Kingdom and Spain have among the highest numbers of deaths per capita in the world.

The vaccine will do nothing for the grieving relatives of those who died. It will not comfort business owners whose companies have already collapsed. And it won't repay the lost wages of unemployed workers, nor ease the hardship endured by so many.

Supplies will be tight. Federal officials plan to ship 6.4 million doses within 24 hours of FDA authorization and up to 40 million doses by the end of the year. Most of these will go to the 21 million health care workers and 3 million nursing home staff in the U.S.

2020-12-08 06:02:05+00:00,351,"A former Alabama state senator died of Covid-19 last week at age 78, officials said.

The former senator, Larry Dixon, a Republican who was also a former executive director of the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, died Friday, the board said in a statement.

Dr. David Thrasher, a pulmonologist in Montgomery who was a close friend of Dixon's, said Dixon's wife, Gaynell Dixon, told him that her husband's last words to her were a prescient warning to the people of Alabama.

""We messed up. We let our guard down,"" Dixon said, according to Thrasher. ""Please tell everybody to be careful. This is real, and if you get diagnosed, get help immediately.""

Thrasher said Dixon was exposed to the virus at a social gathering ""with a couple of guys"" that was hosted outside about two weeks ago.

Thrasher said he was unsure how many people attended, but he said he knew of two other men who attended and had tested positive.

Thrasher said he treated Dixon for early Covid-19 symptoms a few days after the gathering. As his condition worsened, Dixon was placed on a ventilator, Thrasher said.

Gaynell Dixon also tested positive last week and is still recovering, Thrasher said.

Thrasher said Dixon's two daughters contracted the virus this year but recovered and have not been reinfected since their parents' diagnoses.

Dixon, a Republican, represented Senate District 25, which covers Montgomery, Ellmore and Crenshaw counties, from 1983 until he retired in 2010.

Before his Senate service, Dixon was a member of the state House from 1978 to 1982 and a member of the Montgomery City Council from 1975 to 1978.

In a statement published Monday in the Alabama Daily News, Perry Hooper, a former state representative and member of the State Republican Executive Committee, wrote that he was ""still in shock"" over Dixon's death.

""Larry, although not a Montgomery native, loved his adopted hometown as much as anyone,"" Hooper said. ""He devoted his life to service to this great city. He was a great legislator, a man of great moral character, and a devoted and loving husband and father.""

The Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, which issues licenses for medical practitioners, said Friday that it was ""forever grateful"" for Dixon's 35 years as executive director.

""He set an incredible example of service for us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Gaynell, and his family during this difficult time,"" the board members said in a statement.

Alabama has set state records for hospitalization rates and numbers of new Covid-19 cases.

As of Monday, the state had recorded almost 270,000 Covid-19 infections and 3,889 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. State residents have tested positive at a rate of 34.7 percent over the past seven days — one of the highest rates in the country.

Thrasher said Dixon was the ""finest human being,"" whose last wish was to prevent more Alabamians from following his fate.

""He wanted to encourage people to be careful, wear a mask, don't socially gather,"" Thrasher said. ""He said, 'Let's save some lives.'""",MSNBC,"['warns', 'covid19', 'dies', 'board', '78', 'alabama', 'service', 'dixons', 'thrasher', 'words', 'senator', 'covid', 'dixon', 'tested', 'state', 'montgomery', 'messed']",0

2020-12-08 04:05:07+00:00,82,"By the time you finish reading this, at the rate we're at right now, about 10 people in the United States will have died of Covid-19. To date, over 14.7 million have tested positive for the coronavirus. You can now add me, my husband and our three children to that massive number. Despite our country's best efforts to ""do the right thing,"" the number continues to rise. But what is doing the right thing, really?

Despite our country’s best efforts to “do the right thing,” that number continues to rise. But what is doing the right thing, really?

That's something I've been grappling with since my husband tested positive the day before Thanksgiving. He woke up with a headache and a minor sore throat. Normally, we'd have chalked those symptoms up to a hangover or just general malaise. But given the situation, we decided to get him tested.

Masked up, I joined him for a complicated and confusing tele-doc appointment. After a long wait, we were tested at an urgent care clinic. His rapid test came back positive. We weren't naive enough to think driving home with my head out the window with two masks on would stop me from getting it, too. If he had it, I knew that meant I did or soon would. So we needed to figure out the next two weeks quickly.

My husband immediately went back to our New York City apartment to isolate. I stayed in our New Jersey home with our three kids, who are 14, 11 and 7, and I self-quarantined in a guest room above our garage, separate from my kids. Just having this type of housing arrangement is a privilege. I didn't see them for an entire week. They were forced to take care of themselves while I was isolated. Our generous neighbors and family dropped off meals at our doors; I am incredibly thankful — and lucky — that we have that kind of support system.

Had we not gotten my husband tested, we would have kept our kids in school, exposing our family, our kids' classmates and our colleagues. We were a day away from unknowingly becoming superspreaders. That absolutely terrifies me.

By the end of the week, I had tested positive, as well. My symptoms changed by the day, but they mostly felt just like a terrible flu. The worst symptoms were the fear and anxiety about what was to come and about whom I might have infected. Here again, I was privileged enough to be able to manage those fears, with doctors answering my frantic phone calls and messages. And I work for a company that let me put my life on hold and focus on my health.

But even with this support, parts of the process failed. The urgent care clinic never gave me my test results. My husband figured out which lab it used and created a patient profile online. My husband's first PCR test was never processed, or it got lost. We're still not sure. When he went home to New York, he paid $250 for another test from a private lab — again, a luxury available only to those who can afford it.

This stress isn't unusual — it's the norm. Across the country, Americans have raised the alarm for months about our haphazard testing and muddled guidelines. And the guidelines have shifted since the pandemic started. Is it any wonder that this spread continues? We're all confused. I still don't know where we got Covid-19.

And forget about contact tracing calls; making them was insanely difficult. So many of the people I might have exposed didn't want to hear it. The people I came in contact with and the big-box stores I spent time in seemed to have no interest in when I might have exposed them. None of the stores took my temperature, but even if they had done so, it wouldn't have made a difference — I had no fever.

One of the people who did take my call seriously, the woman who cuts my hair, canceled her Thanksgiving, took her kids out of school, stopped going to work and made no money for nearly two weeks. Her test, which she spent three hours waiting to get, came back eight days later. It was negative. But how many people can put their lives, livelihoods and jobs on hold just to do the right thing?

Hourly wage workers are going to work sick because they can't afford not to work. Many of their employers are ignoring the symptoms, because they are trying to keep business alive.

Testing remains a challenge — and there are no consequences for people who don't self-isolate while they wait several days just to get results, especially if they have no or minimal symptoms.

And then there are people who may know they are spreading the coronavirus and simply don't care. Any of these scenarios is possible, because there is no comprehensive national containment plan.

Quarantining symptom-free, rambunctious kids for 14 days can feel excessive when you are trying to manage your life, and the rules and consequences vary state to state and even sometimes city by city, as do the mechanisms for checking up on residents. But the consequences are real, and they are everywhere. We see them in our exploding rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.

My family is extremely lucky. We didn't get super sick. We had access to testing, eventually got some results and had the space and the financial stability to isolate safely. We have supportive paying jobs and schools that can offer virtual learning. If I didn't have all of that, maybe it would have been a lot harder to follow the guidelines.

What's most concerning is that our government is doing little to nothing to make these guidelines easier to follow. In South Korea and Hong Kong, a positive test means two weeks in a government-sponsored quarantine hotel, with meals provided. Here, almost the entire system is reliant on personal responsibility.

Covid-19, of course, doesn't care whether you are rich, poor, Black, white, young or old. It doesn't care whether you're about to celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas or your birthday. We're told to do the right thing but not fully how or why. And what I have learned is that the ""right thing"" gets easier the more privileged you are.

The only way we can get through this is if we have a system that works for everyone, and after having Covid-19, I'm convinced that we do not.

As the Food and Drug Administration's external advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Dec. 17 to discuss the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, the tidal wave of questions about the vaccines has begun — many of which still have no answers, but the answers to some of which we can surmise from data released so far.

If you have questions, submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #AskDrKavita and we will do our best to provide timely responses.

As more data become available, we in the expert medical community will do our best to keep you posted. But one thing is unanimous: Scientist are flabbergasted at the progress that has been made with vaccine development. Some worry that the speed and President Donald Trump's unfortunate moniker, ""Operation Warp Speed,"" indicate that safety is being compromised. Hopefully, the review of more complete data in the U.S. will reinforce what the U.K. has determined, which is that it is safe and effective for limited use.

I've decided to answer five basic questions about the vaccines here, but I'm sure there are many, many more. If you have questions, submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #AskDrKavita and we will do our best to provide timely responses.

So, let's identify what we know — at least as of today:

1. How do these mRNA Vaccines work?

First, it should be said the Covid-19 vaccines cannot give you Covid-19 — some vaccines do contain live virus (like the chickenpox or measles vaccines), which can sometimes pose risks to people with compromised immune systems. But all of the Covid-19 vaccines to date, including the two up for immediate approval, don't contain live virus.

Furthermore, because the vaccines are mRNA vaccines, they don't affect or interact with our DNA. The mRNA vaccine gives instructions to cells to make the coronavirus spike protein develop an immune response which will prepare your body in case of exposure to the real Covid-19 virus. Think of the mRNA vaccine as an accelerated workout for your muscles to get ready for the Ironman triathlon — it helps prime your body in case you decide to run the race (or here, if you get exposed to Covid-19).

2. How will the vaccine be distributed?

Both vaccines require ultra-cold, freezer-level temperatures. Pfizer has an elaborate process to ship the vaccines, shipping each box of 195 vials with 50 pounds of dry ice pellets to ensure a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius, with shipment by plane, train or truck to states, tribal nations and territories.

The federal government will serve as air traffic control, telling manufacturers where to send shipments. States have submitted plans for distribution, and hospitals around the country have invested in freezers. space and staff to distribute the vaccine to health care workers and long-term care facilities as the first priority group.

3. How effective is the vaccine?

The vaccine will work best after you receive both doses — in other words, you really need the second dose to feel its true effectiveness — and the immune system response is at its best about one to two weeks after the second dose (just like your muscles are conditioned for the Ironman a few weeks into intensive training).

Once you do get the vaccine, it will be about 90 percent to 95 percent effective in reducing your chance of having the disease. This means that for people who are vaccinated, there is a 95 percent chance of reducing mild or moderate-to-severe disease compared to people who are not vaccinated. People who received the vaccine had 95 percent fewer cases of Covid-19 compared to those who did not receive the vaccine.

There are a lot of caveats around these numbers, and we believe that in the real world, the effectiveness percentage might be a bit lower, but it's certainly enough to flatten the curves we are seeing.

4. How safe is the vaccine?

We don't have long-term data, but we have tens of thousands of trial participants who have been painstakingly scrutinized. No serious side effects have been observed. That doesn't mean there are no side effects; local reactions (such as mild ache at the injection site), as well as feeling some generalized symptoms, have been observed. The FDA will continue to monitor long-term safety for side effects.

As a cautionary measure, remember that the FDA isn't granting a full biologics license application (which is considered a full approval). It's essentially giving a temporary permit to use the vaccine (an emergency use authorization). Such temporary authorization can be taken away (as was done with hydroxychloroquine when it was discovered that it doesn't help treat the virus) depending on the evolving data.

The temporary authorizations mean that the benefits of a treatment outweigh the risks, to the best of scientists' knowledge. And as a final reassurance to the public, tens of millions of health care workers will get the vaccine in the next weeks, so we will have real-world examples of any side effects from their experiences (keeping in mind the timeline — it's a double dose separated by 21 to 28 days).

5. When can I expect to get the vaccine?

That depends. States are permitted some flexibility. Some plan to vaccinate essential workers after health care workers and long-term care residents, while others are prioritizing elderly residents. You should ask your local health officials for details, and you can look here for details about your state's plan.

The hardest part of this next period will be identifying where and how to get your vaccine. Cost will hopefully not be an issue, because public and private payers have made a commitment to waive costs. But because of the complex storage requirements, it might not be that easy for every doctor's office to stock the vaccine on site. The mRNA vaccines are stable for several days out of a freezer in a refrigerator and for up to three hours outside a refrigerator. That means supply initially might be limited to places that can handle storage as well as distribution in a timely manner with no potential for waste.

Those are some basics about what we know. But of course, there is a lot we don't know, including how long immunity lasts or what this vaccine means for children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer and Moderna have started testing the vaccine on younger adolescents and teens. Some adult women who didn't know they were pregnant at the beginning of trials found out they were, in fact, pregnant after they received the vaccine, so we expect some data about those patients to be reported.

Mostly, we expect that there will be incredible demand. It's important to remember that vaccines don't save lives — vaccinations do. In other words, you need shots in the arm for this to work. So if you thought making a vaccine in record time was the big hurdle, believe it or not, getting at least 70 percent to 80 percent of the country to be vaccinated or to achieve immunity by infection is really the hardest part. The best advice is to hold tight and to take an active part in the dialogue, and if you have questions, don't be afraid to ask.

""We messed up. We let our guard down,"" Dixon said, according to Thrasher. ""Please tell everybody to be careful. This is real, and if you get diagnosed, get help immediately.""

Thrasher said Dixon was exposed to the virus at a social gathering ""with a couple of guys"" that was hosted outside about two weeks ago.

Thrasher said he was unsure how many people attended, but he said he knew of two other men who attended and had tested positive.

Thrasher said he treated Dixon for early Covid-19 symptoms a few days after the gathering. As his condition worsened, Dixon was placed on a ventilator, Thrasher said.

Gaynell Dixon also tested positive last week and is still recovering, Thrasher said.

Thrasher said Dixon's two daughters contracted the virus this year but recovered and have not been reinfected since their parents' diagnoses.

Dixon, a Republican, represented Senate District 25, which covers Montgomery, Ellmore and Crenshaw counties, from 1983 until he retired in 2010.

Before his Senate service, Dixon was a member of the state House from 1978 to 1982 and a member of the Montgomery City Council from 1975 to 1978.

In a statement published Monday in the Alabama Daily News, Perry Hooper, a former state representative and member of the State Republican Executive Committee, wrote that he was ""still in shock"" over Dixon's death.

""Larry, although not a Montgomery native, loved his adopted hometown as much as anyone,"" Hooper said. ""He devoted his life to service to this great city. He was a great legislator, a man of great moral character, and a devoted and loving husband and father.""

The Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, which issues licenses for medical practitioners, said Friday that it was ""forever grateful"" for Dixon's 35 years as executive director.

""He set an incredible example of service for us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Gaynell, and his family during this difficult time,"" the board members said in a statement.

Alabama has set state records for hospitalization rates and numbers of new Covid-19 cases.

As of Monday, the state had recorded almost 270,000 Covid-19 infections and 3,889 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. State residents have tested positive at a rate of 34.7 percent over the past seven days — one of the highest rates in the country.

Thrasher said Dixon was the ""finest human being,"" whose last wish was to prevent more Alabamians from following his fate.

""He wanted to encourage people to be careful, wear a mask, don't socially gather,"" Thrasher said. ""He said, 'Let's save some lives.'""",MSNBC,"['warns', 'covid19', 'dies', 'board', '78', 'alabama', 'service', 'dixons', 'thrasher', 'words', 'senator', 'covid', 'dixon', 'tested', 'state', 'montgomery', 'messed']",0

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference? The Senate majority leader is neither the architect of an illegal war, nor the former leader of a terrorist group. Nevertheless, he has much blood on his hands.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'relief', 'reaper', 'mcconnells', 'lives', 'leader', 'health', 'mitch', 'nickname', 'senate', 'economic', 'grim', 'americans', 'mcconnell', 'workers', 'covid', 'reality']",0
2020-12-07 23:33:08+00:00,19,"As we head into what some public health experts are calling the darkest days of the year, there are glimmers of light in the form of at least two — if not more — viable vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, aka Covid-19. As the Food and Drug Administration's external advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Dec. 17 to discuss the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, the tidal wave of questions about the vaccines has begun — many of which still have no answers, but the answers to some of which we can surmise from data released so far.

If you have questions, submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #AskDrKavita and we will do our best to provide timely responses.

As more data become available, we in the expert medical community will do our best to keep you posted. But one thing is unanimous: Scientist are flabbergasted at the progress that has been made with vaccine development. Some worry that the speed and President Donald Trump's unfortunate moniker, ""Operation Warp Speed,"" indicate that safety is being compromised. Hopefully, the review of more complete data in the U.S. will reinforce what the U.K. has determined, which is that it is safe and effective for limited use.

I've decided to answer five basic questions about the vaccines here, but I'm sure there are many, many more. If you have questions, submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #AskDrKavita and we will do our best to provide timely responses.

So, let's identify what we know — at least as of today:

1. How do these mRNA Vaccines work?

First, it should be said the Covid-19 vaccines cannot give you Covid-19 — some vaccines do contain live virus (like the chickenpox or measles vaccines), which can sometimes pose risks to people with compromised immune systems. But all of the Covid-19 vaccines to date, including the two up for immediate approval, don't contain live virus.

Furthermore, because the vaccines are mRNA vaccines, they don't affect or interact with our DNA. The mRNA vaccine gives instructions to cells to make the coronavirus spike protein develop an immune response which will prepare your body in case of exposure to the real Covid-19 virus. Think of the mRNA vaccine as an accelerated workout for your muscles to get ready for the Ironman triathlon — it helps prime your body in case you decide to run the race (or here, if you get exposed to Covid-19).

2. How will the vaccine be distributed?

Both vaccines require ultra-cold, freezer-level temperatures. Pfizer has an elaborate process to ship the vaccines, shipping each box of 195 vials with 50 pounds of dry ice pellets to ensure a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius, with shipment by plane, train or truck to states, tribal nations and territories.

The federal government will serve as air traffic control, telling manufacturers where to send shipments. States have submitted plans for distribution, and hospitals around the country have invested in freezers. space and staff to distribute the vaccine to health care workers and long-term care facilities as the first priority group.

3. How effective is the vaccine?

The vaccine will work best after you receive both doses — in other words, you really need the second dose to feel its true effectiveness — and the immune system response is at its best about one to two weeks after the second dose (just like your muscles are conditioned for the Ironman a few weeks into intensive training).

Once you do get the vaccine, it will be about 90 percent to 95 percent effective in reducing your chance of having the disease. This means that for people who are vaccinated, there is a 95 percent chance of reducing mild or moderate-to-severe disease compared to people who are not vaccinated. People who received the vaccine had 95 percent fewer cases of Covid-19 compared to those who did not receive the vaccine.

There are a lot of caveats around these numbers, and we believe that in the real world, the effectiveness percentage might be a bit lower, but it's certainly enough to flatten the curves we are seeing.

4. How safe is the vaccine?

We don't have long-term data, but we have tens of thousands of trial participants who have been painstakingly scrutinized. No serious side effects have been observed. That doesn't mean there are no side effects; local reactions (such as mild ache at the injection site), as well as feeling some generalized symptoms, have been observed. The FDA will continue to monitor long-term safety for side effects.

As a cautionary measure, remember that the FDA isn't granting a full biologics license application (which is considered a full approval). It's essentially giving a temporary permit to use the vaccine (an emergency use authorization). Such temporary authorization can be taken away (as was done with hydroxychloroquine when it was discovered that it doesn't help treat the virus) depending on the evolving data.

The temporary authorizations mean that the benefits of a treatment outweigh the risks, to the best of scientists' knowledge. And as a final reassurance to the public, tens of millions of health care workers will get the vaccine in the next weeks, so we will have real-world examples of any side effects from their experiences (keeping in mind the timeline — it's a double dose separated by 21 to 28 days).

5. When can I expect to get the vaccine?

That depends. States are permitted some flexibility. Some plan to vaccinate essential workers after health care workers and long-term care residents, while others are prioritizing elderly residents. You should ask your local health officials for details, and you can look here for details about your state's plan.

The hardest part of this next period will be identifying where and how to get your vaccine. Cost will hopefully not be an issue, because public and private payers have made a commitment to waive costs. But because of the complex storage requirements, it might not be that easy for every doctor's office to stock the vaccine on site. The mRNA vaccines are stable for several days out of a freezer in a refrigerator and for up to three hours outside a refrigerator. That means supply initially might be limited to places that can handle storage as well as distribution in a timely manner with no potential for waste.

Those are some basics about what we know. But of course, there is a lot we don't know, including how long immunity lasts or what this vaccine means for children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer and Moderna have started testing the vaccine on younger adolescents and teens. Some adult women who didn't know they were pregnant at the beginning of trials found out they were, in fact, pregnant after they received the vaccine, so we expect some data about those patients to be reported.

Mostly, we expect that there will be incredible demand. It's important to remember that vaccines don't save lives — vaccinations do. In other words, you need shots in the arm for this to work. So if you thought making a vaccine in record time was the big hurdle, believe it or not, getting at least 70 percent to 80 percent of the country to be vaccinated or to achieve immunity by infection is really the hardest part. The best advice is to hold tight and to take an active part in the dialogue, and if you have questions, don't be afraid to ask. And as always, we will do our best to keep you informed.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'know', 'dont', 'questions', 'health', 'care', 'data', 'vaccines', 'mrna', 'heres', 'best', 'vaccine', 'covid']",0

So will these looming deadlines force the obstinate Senate majority leader to reluctantly sign off on a new bipartisan bill that offers $908 billion in relief? That's half of what Trump says he was willing to agree to in October, and less than a third of what House Democrats initially asked for in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act in May.

Remember: The United States is confronting not just the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression but also the worst health crisis since the Spanish flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the coming winter is “going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.” Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, a Covid-19 advisor to President-elect Joe Biden, is even blunter: “We are about to enter Covid hell.”

Yet, shamefully, such warnings seem to have no impact on McConnell. He has turned the Senate into a judge-confirming machine, even as the virus ravages the nation and multiple Covid-19 relief bills passed by the House of Representatives languish on his desk.

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives. McConnell is one of them. And yet, time and again, he refuses to do so. He insists on protecting corporations — whether it’s the $500 billion “slush fund” for big companies that he included in the CARES Act in March, or his vow that no Covid-19 relief bill will pass the Senate “without liability protection” for employers who risk the lives of their workers. But protecting workers themselves? Or renters? Or hungry kids? To quote veteran activist Ralph Nader, McConnell is a “a corporation masquerading as a human being.” Nader has also called him “the most brazen evil, cruel and powerful legislator” he has come across “in the last 50 years.”

Few people on this planet can honestly say they have the power to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from losing their jobs, their homes, and even their lives. McConnell is one of them.

There was a rather revealing moment in October, during a live TV debate between McConnell and his Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. She didn’t pull her punches. “The House passed a bill in May and the Senate went on vacation. I mean, you just don’t do that. You negotiate. Senator, it is a national crisis.”

McConnell’s response? He laughed. In fact, he carried on chuckling as McGrath said, “If you want to call yourself a leader, you’ve got to get things done.”

Do the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Americans seem funny to him? Is this 78-year-old father and grandfather from Kentucky really so heartless?

Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should “spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.” But what if empathy, however, is beyond the grim reaper?

Over the past decade, I have spent my own career as a TV interviewer asking everyone from Iraq War architect John Bolton to Contra backer Otto Reich to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness whether they had issues sleeping at night; whether they regretted the deaths they had — directly or indirectly — caused.

Today, these are the kind of questions I would like to pose to McConnell perhaps more than any other person in the United States. How does he sleep at night? How does he rationalize the deaths and the suffering caused by his willful inaction and indifference? The Senate majority leader is neither the architect of an illegal war, nor the former leader of a terrorist group. Nevertheless, he has much blood on his hands.",MSNBC,"['covid19', 'relief', 'reaper', 'mcconnells', 'lives', 'leader', 'health', 'mitch', 'nickname', 'senate', 'economic', 'grim', 'americans', 'mcconnell', 'workers', 'covid', 'reality']",0
2020-12-07 20:31:04+00:00,25,"Melania Trump should have had 2020 off. The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Melania ""doesn't shake in her boots ever and she tells Donald exactly how she feels,"" says Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of the First Lady and ex-East Wing adviser.

She believes ""if he's going to do it, he better do it right and he better do it with brass knuckles."" pic.twitter.com/biXV2SmbBE — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) October 2, 2020

We got precious little time to savor the audio before the 2020 news cyclone swept it away. Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.

ok, FINE, we'll auto-tune the ""Christmas stuff"" thing into a carol 🎅🎄🦌 pic.twitter.com/VEprOK3QOP — The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) October 2, 2020

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Ah well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas — at least for a while. This time next year, it will be Jill Biden's turn to throw the soirees, but 'til then we'll have to muddle through somehow.",MSNBC,"['surging', 'melania', 'christmas', 'administration', 'know', 'doing', 'stuff', 'house', 'white', 'events', 'holiday', 'trump', 'covid']",0
2020-12-07 18:46:03+00:00,83,"By the time you finish reading this, at the rate we're at right now, about 10 people in the United States will have died of Covid-19. To date, over 14.7 million have tested positive for the coronavirus. You can now add me, my husband and our three children to that massive number. Despite our country's best efforts to ""do the right thing,"" the number continues to rise. But what is doing the right thing, really?

Despite our country’s best efforts to “do the right thing,” that number continues to rise. But what is doing the right thing, really?

That's something I've been grappling with since my husband tested positive the day before Thanksgiving. He woke up with a headache and a minor sore throat. Normally, we'd have chalked those symptoms up to a hangover or just general malaise. But given the situation, we decided to get him tested.

Masked up, I joined him for a complicated and confusing tele-doc appointment. After a long wait, we were tested at an urgent care clinic. His rapid test came back positive. We weren't naive enough to think driving home with my head out the window with two masks on would stop me from getting it, too. If he had it, I knew that meant I did or soon would. So we needed to figure out the next two weeks quickly.

My husband immediately went back to our New York City apartment to isolate. I stayed in our New Jersey home with our three kids, who are 14, 11 and 7, and I self-quarantined in a guest room above our garage, separate from my kids. Just having this type of housing arrangement is a privilege. I didn't see them for an entire week. They were forced to take care of themselves while I was isolated. Our generous neighbors and family dropped off meals at our doors; I am incredibly thankful — and lucky — that we have that kind of support system.

Had we not gotten my husband tested, we would have kept our kids in school, exposing our family, our kids' classmates and our colleagues. We were a day away from unknowingly becoming superspreaders. That absolutely terrifies me.

By the end of the week, I had tested positive, as well. My symptoms changed by the day, but they mostly felt just like a terrible flu. The worst symptoms were the fear and anxiety about what was to come and about whom I might have infected. Here again, I was privileged enough to be able to manage those fears, with doctors answering my frantic phone calls and messages. And I work for a company that let me put my life on hold and focus on my health.

But even with this support, parts of the process failed. The urgent care clinic never gave me my test results. My husband figured out which lab it used and created a patient profile online. My husband's first PCR test was never processed, or it got lost. We're still not sure. When he went home to New York, he paid $250 for another test from a private lab — again, a luxury available only to those who can afford it.

This stress isn't unusual — it's the norm. Across the country, Americans have raised the alarm for months about our haphazard testing and muddled guidelines. And the guidelines have shifted since the pandemic started. Is it any wonder that this spread continues? We're all confused. I still don't know where we got Covid-19.

And forget about contact tracing calls; making them was insanely difficult. So many of the people I might have exposed didn't want to hear it. The people I came in contact with and the big-box stores I spent time in seemed to have no interest in when I might have exposed them. None of the stores took my temperature, but even if they had done so, it wouldn't have made a difference — I had no fever.

One of the people who did take my call seriously, the woman who cuts my hair, canceled her Thanksgiving, took her kids out of school, stopped going to work and made no money for nearly two weeks. Her test, which she spent three hours waiting to get, came back eight days later. It was negative. But how many people can put their lives, livelihoods and jobs on hold just to do the right thing?

Hourly wage workers are going to work sick because they can't afford not to work. Many of their employers are ignoring the symptoms, because they are trying to keep business alive.

Testing remains a challenge — and there are no consequences for people who don't self-isolate while they wait several days just to get results, especially if they have no or minimal symptoms.

And then there are people who may know they are spreading the coronavirus and simply don't care. Any of these scenarios is possible, because there is no comprehensive national containment plan.

Quarantining symptom-free, rambunctious kids for 14 days can feel excessive when you are trying to manage your life, and the rules and consequences vary state to state and even sometimes city by city, as do the mechanisms for checking up on residents. But the consequences are real, and they are everywhere. We see them in our exploding rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.

My family is extremely lucky. We didn't get super sick. We had access to testing, eventually got some results and had the space and the financial stability to isolate safely. We have supportive paying jobs and schools that can offer virtual learning. If I didn't have all of that, maybe it would have been a lot harder to follow the guidelines.

What's most concerning is that our government is doing little to nothing to make these guidelines easier to follow. In South Korea and Hong Kong, a positive test means two weeks in a government-sponsored quarantine hotel, with meals provided. Here, almost the entire system is reliant on personal responsibility.

Covid-19, of course, doesn't care whether you are rich, poor, Black, white, young or old. It doesn't care whether you're about to celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas or your birthday. We're told to do the right thing but not fully how or why. And what I have learned is that the ""right thing"" gets easier the more privileged you are.

The only way we can get through this is if we have a system that works for everyone, and after having Covid-19, I'm convinced that we do not.

2020-12-07 14:31:08+00:00,20,"Scientist Melissa Miller never knows what to expect at her lab from week to week. Since last spring, there’s been a constant shortage of testing supplies. Sometimes it’s the reagents needed to run tests, and other times it’s as simple as the plastic tips used on the pipettes.

“The shortages still exist,” said Miller, director of UNC Medical Center’s clinical microbiology lab. “Lab directors have been screaming about this for months.”

Labs across the country have been facing dire shortages of supplies as the number of Covid-19 tests being processed has skyrocketed. But with so many supplies directed toward Covid-19 testing, it's increasingly becoming more difficult for patients to get an accurate diagnosis for sexually transmitted infections, common but serious illnesses like pneumonia and other potentially life-threatening infections.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

A November survey by the American Society for Microbiology of 134 labs around the country found that more than half of them were experiencing shortages in the supplies used to test for bacteria that cause common diseases like strep throat and pneumonia. More than 65 percent of labs reported shortages for testing for STIs.

This week, Miller learned the reagents needed to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea were on back order for the next three weeks, she told NBC News. Now the lab, which serves hundreds of patients, can no longer do these tests.

“It’s hard for our providers to keep track of what we’re able to do on any given day,” Miller said. “Providers used to be able to ask for every kind of test in our lab and now they can’t. It’s affecting their ability to practice medicine quite honestly.”

Supplies for STI testing have been hit particularly hard, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a letter to doctors in September, advising them that if there are shortages in their region, they may need to start rationing tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, only giving them to people who are at higher risk.

“The goal of this guidance is to maximize the number of people diagnosed and treated for STIs, while prioritizing individuals most likely to experience complications, such as maternal transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease, or increased risk of HIV infection,” Dr. Laura Bachmann, chief medical officer for the CDC’s Division of STD Prevention, told NBC News in a statement.

Doctors at some Planned Parenthood clinics say when they’re experiencing shortages, they now have to diagnose some patients empirically, meaning based on clinical observations rather than a routine test. Since many STIs are often asymptomatic, that can can be particularly challenging — and dangerous for patients.

We’re expecting an explosion in STD rates that top where we were pre-Covid levels.

“I’ve never been able to not order a test,” said Dr. Krishna Upadhya, vice president of quality care and health equity at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “It’s very difficult as a health care provider to not have the tool you need to take the best care of your patients.”

Planned Parenthood doctors are still encouraging patients to come in for testing.

But public health experts fear the shortages could be causing too many people to go undiagnosed and unknowingly spread STIs, causing even more alarm since STI rates were already on the rise before the pandemic.

According to the latest CDC statistics, chlamydia cases have increased nearly 20 percent since 2014, gonorrhea cases are up more than 60 percent and syphilis is up a stunning 71 percent.

“We already had an out-of-control STD epidemic before Covid,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “We’re expecting an explosion in STD rates that top where we were pre-Covid levels.”

It's not just STI testing. Some labs now can't test for food-borne bacteria, like salmonella and E. coli.

“This is the public health crisis going on below the Covid public health crisis,” Miller said.

A few weeks ago, Miller’s lab couldn’t run the gold-standard test for the dangerous staph infection MRSA. They had to go back to an older method that isn’t as accurate.

Sudden shortages have forced TriCore Reference Laboratories, which serves thousands of people throughout New Mexico, to figure out new ways to do tests. That's caused delays in results for patients.

“We get supplies for today and, maybe, tomorrow,” said Karissa Culbreath, TriCore’s director of infectious diseases. “There are times we have people waiting at the loading dock for the delivery truck so we can run the tests for the needs for that day.”

The problem is going to get worse, Culbreath worries. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals and doctors were only treating Covid-19 patients, so there was less of a need for other types of tests.

But patient volumes have returned to normal, on top of a nationwide surge in Covid-19 cases.

“Now the entire country is a hot spot,"" Culbreath said. ""I only see relief as soon as we’re able to control the pandemic.”

2020-12-07 10:02:02+00:00,89,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, sounded a dire alarm on Sunday amid spiking Covid-19 cases across America as she expressed frustration with government officials who ignore public health guidance as caseloads and deaths rise.

Speaking during an interview on NBC News' “Meet the Press,” Birx said that it’s especially frustrating to see governors and local officials refuse to enact the same mitigation strategies they used to successfully curb the virus’ spread in the summer.

“Right now, across the Sunbelt, we have governors and mayors who have cases equivalent to what they had in the summertime, yet aren’t putting in the same policies and mitigations that they put in the summer that they know changed the course of this pandemic,” Birx said.

“This is the worst event that this country will face not just from a public health side, yet we know what behaviors spread the virus and we know how to change those behaviors to stop spreading the virus.”

Government leaders have sent conflicting messages on the virus since it hit American shores: while public health officials have been fighting to help convince Americans to take the threat of the virus seriously and calling for an aggressive commitment to mitigation efforts, President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned both the severity of the virus and public health guidance meant to combat its spread.

And this month, the White House and State Department planned large indoor holiday parties despite warnings against indoor gatherings.

Birx, who has spent much of the year traveling to different communities as part of the attempt to fight the virus, added that she hears regularly from people all over the country who are mimicking “myths” downplaying the seriousness of it.

“I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don’t work, parroting back that we should work toward herd immunity, parroting back that gatherings don’t result in super-spreading events,” She said.

“And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong, and you can see the evidence base.”

While Birx did not directly address the president’s message, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who joined “Meet the Press” shortly after Birx, did.

He said that while most in government are “taking this more serious, the president is not, as part of his political posturing. It’s very dangerous, it’s extremely dangerous.”

Infections have accelerated across the country around the holiday season — new, daily caseloads have repeatedly surpassed 200,000 in recent days, with more than 2,200 new daily deaths each of the last few days. Overall, there has been 14.7 million coronavirus cases in America and 282,00 deaths, according to an NBC News analysis.

The new influx in cases has caused new strain on both the nation’s hospital and testing systems, and areas have begun implementing new stay-at-home orders in the hopes of easing that strain and blunting the accelerated spread of the virus.

Despite warnings from public health officials not to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, airports broke pandemic-era records as many appeared to still be gathering. Birx said that America will likely see the repercussions of those gatherings in the next week or two and cautioned that Americans cannot continue with the same mindset that they took to Thanksgiving travel.

“Every state across this country needs to increase their mitigation and every state needs to be critically informing their state population that the gatherings we saw in Thanksgiving will lead to a surge, it will happen this week and next week,” she said.

“We cannot go into the holiday season — Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza — with the same kind of attitude that: ‘Those gatherings don’t apply to me.’ They apply to everyone, if you don’t want to lose your grandparents, your aunt.”",MSNBC,"['virus', 'dont', 'health', 'birx', 'fighting', 'gatherings', 'officials', 'holiday', 'spread', 'myths', 'state', 'parroting', 'pandemics', 'public']",0

2020-12-07 04:32:04+00:00,417,"WASHINGTON — As the ravages of the novel coronavirus forced millions of people out of work, shuttered businesses and shrank the value of retirement accounts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged to a three-year low.

But for Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican, the crisis last March signaled something else: a stock buying opportunity.

And for the second time in less than two months, Perdue’s timing was impeccable. He avoided a sharp loss and reaped a stunning gain by selling and then buying the same stock: Cardlytics, an Atlanta-based financial technology company on whose board of directors he once served.

On Jan. 23, as word spread through Congress that the coronavirus posed a major economic and public health threat, Perdue sold off $1 million to $5 million in Cardlytics stock at $86 a share before it plunged, according to congressional disclosures.

Weeks later, in March, after the company’s stock plunged further following an unexpected leadership shakeup and lower-than-forecast earnings, Perdue bought the stock back for $30 a share, investing between $200,000 and $500,000.

Those shares have now quadrupled in value, closing at $121 a share on Tuesday.

The Cardlytics transactions were just a slice of a large number of investment decisions made in the early days of the pandemic by Perdue and other senators. They stirred public outrage after it became clear that some members of Congress had been briefed on the economic and health threat the virus posed. The transactions were mentioned briefly in a story published by the Intercept in May.

Now that Perdue is locked in a pitched battle for reelection in a Jan. 5 runoff, his trades during a public health and economic crisis have become an issue in what already has become a negative, expensive campaign that will determine which party controls the Senate.

There is no evidence that Perdue, who is among the wealthier members of the Senate, acted on information gained as a member of Congress or through his long-standing relationship with company officials. It’s illegal to use nonpublic information gained as a company insider or member of Congress to make investment decisions.

But legal experts say the timing of his sale, the fact that he quickly bought Cardlytics stock back when it had lost two-thirds of its market value and his close ties to company officials all warrant scrutiny.

“This does seem suspicious,” said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law school professor who specializes in corporate and securities issues. But he added, “You need more than suspicions to convict.”

The Perdue campaign declined a request for an interview with the senator. In a statement, Perdue spokesperson John Burke said the senator had been cleared of wrongdoing but did not provide details.

“The bi-partisan Senate Ethics Committee, DOJ and SEC all independently and swiftly cleared Senator Perdue months ago, which was reported on,” Burke said.

Perdue’s opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff, has seized on his stock trading while trying to brand him as a “crook.”

Perdue is not the only senator on the ballot in Georgia. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, also a Republican, is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock in a bid to complete the remainder of retired Sen. Johnny Isakson’s term.

Perdue’s Cardlytics transactions fit into a broader pattern of stock moves he made when the coronavirus first struck the U.S.

At the time, Perdue publicly maintained that the economy was strong and praised President Donald Trump during a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News Channel for “executing the greatest economic turnaround in U.S. history.”

A series of swift transactions in his portfolio told a different story, however, showing the senator dumped some company stocks, while investing in others — like protective equipment maker DuPont and pharmaceutical company Pfizer — that were poised to do well during the pandemic.

Perdue has previously said that outside financial advisers make most of his trades.

But Donna Nagy, an Indiana University law professor, said that type of arrangement doesn’t preclude Perdue from directing an adviser to make specific transactions. She said one way for members of Congress to avoid questions about their financial holdings is to put them in a blind trust, which Perdue has not done.

“All of these questions about the motivations behind our members of Congress and their personal securities trading could be alleviated if Congress passed a law that limited investments,” said Nagy, who specializes in securities law. “Ordinary citizens should not have to question members of Congress about their investments.”

The issue was enough of a liability that Perdue abruptly sold off between $3.2 million and $9.4 million of his stock portfolio over a four-day period in mid-April, according to an Associated Press review of mandatory financial disclosures he has submitted to the Senate. He did not sell his stock in Cardlytics.

Still, Perdue has largely avoided the same degree of scrutiny faced by some of his colleagues.

Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina drew the most attention and stepped down as Senate Intelligence Committee chair amid a probe of his sale of upward of $1.7 million in stock, which came when he was privately warning some well-heeled constituents about the virus while publicly downplaying the threat.

Cardlytics works at the intersection of banking and online marketing. It helps run rewards programs for financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, using data the banks have gathered on their customers to market to them — similar to what Facebook does with targeted ads.

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

After the March turmoil, its share price dramatically rebounded. Lynne Laube, Cardlytics’ current CEO, said the pandemic had a lot to do with it, driving consumer interest in savings programs.

“I hate to say this pandemic is playing in our favor, but it’s playing in our favor,” she said during an earnings call in May.

Perdue acquired 75,000 shares in Cardlytics through stock options offered for his service on the company’s board from 2010 to 2014, when he stepped down after winning his Senate seat, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. The company, which at the time had not yet gone public, also offered him options that would become available in October 2020 and January 2022.

Perdue’s latest financial disclosures do not indicate whether he has exercised the options that became available in October.

But according to Coffee, the Columbia University law professor, it’s an unusual move by the company.

“I’ve never seen options extended from 2014 to 2022,” he said. “That’s a very long extension.”

While Perdue left the company’s board, he has maintained ties to some of its executives, who have donated more than $30,000 to his political committees. Donations made to Perdue account for nearly 80% of all giving to federal candidates by Cardlytics employees over the past decade, records show.

Perdue, meanwhile, has used social media to publicize the company. In August 2016, he took a tour of its office and posed for a photo with Laube and then-CEO Scott Grimes, which he posted to Facebook. In fall 2019, he introduced Laube and Grimes at a gala in Atlanta, where they received a business achievement award.

Isakson, who served with Perdue, took steps to avoid the type of scrutiny Perdue is now facing. Isakson, a Republican, put most of his own holdings in a blind trust after some of his assets drew unwanted attention in 2012.

“I said I need to be as patently pure and patently clean as anybody, and the best way to do that is a blind trust,” Isakson, who served on the Senate’s finance and ethics committees, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution in 2017. “I don’t know what I own.”",MSNBC,"['opportunity', 'cardlytics', 'congress', 'senate', 'stock', 'senator', 'saw', 'perdue', 'panic', 'financial', 'company', 'transactions', 'amid', 'georgia', 'sen', 'million', 'covid']",0

2020-12-06 22:32:02+00:00,30,"CENTERVILLE, Ohio – Like many public school districts around the country, Centerville City Schools near Dayton started the year off remotely for the 8,000 kids it serves. Based on recommendations from local public health officials, the district didn't resume in-person classes until mid-October.

It didn't last. By late October, Superintendent Tom Henderson said the district was scrambling every day to find teachers for 90 to 115 classrooms, competing with other districts for substitutes. At one point, Henderson and his team were filling in teacher gaps hour by hour when substitutes and full-time teachers had planning periods. Crucial support staff members were also tough to find. Some days, they didn't have enough school bus drivers.

Too many people had either caught Covid-19 or had recently come into contact with someone who had it.

""Most of the exposure has come from outside of school,"" Henderson said. ""The quarantines are just really hard to deal with.""

The week before Thanksgiving, Henderson pulled the plug. Faced with rising case counts in the community and expecting positive case counts and associated quarantines to spike after the holiday, he shifted the district to remote learning until Jan. 19 — more than two weeks after New Year's Day.

Henderson said the local public health commissioner has acknowledged that schools are doing a good job preventing the spread of Covid-19 inside their buildings. But there's nothing they can do about the broader outbreak.

As the pandemic raged across the United States, experts warned that keeping schools open for in-person learning would become increasingly difficult if community spread went unchecked. Centerville's experience is an object lesson in that dynamic. Several other school districts announced similar shifts to remote learning over the holiday period.

Keeping schools open has emerged as a flashpoint over how states and municipalities are handling the pandemic. As in many other places in the U.S., restaurants in Ohio remain open with indoor dining, which epidemiologists have pointed to as a major source of community spread.

Centerville's schools also illustrate a broader challenge for communities with rising case rates — quarantines that end up sidelining people for multiple cycles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends that people who are exposed to Covid-19 quarantine for 10 days if no symptoms are reported and for seven days if they have negative test results and no symptoms. That is down from previous guidance, which recommended 14 days of quarantine regardless of symptoms or test results.

New quarantines are required for every positive exposure. Within a family, exposures can stack, with the quarantine clock resetting upon each new contact with an infected person. Under the original guidance, a person who tested positive needed to isolate for 10 days, but a caregiver or a sibling had to quarantine for 14 days, starting at the end of the infected person's contagious period. Although the CDC has revised its quarantine guidance, the same dynamic still occurs, albeit for a shorter time.

""Twenty-four days is a long time for a staff or a student,"" Henderson said.

In-person school is vital on a number of levels. At a minimum, it functions as child care for working parents and provides food and a safe place to go for children who are food insecure or homeless. Remote school is less effective for younger children, which is why some states have prioritized reopening elementary schools and kept high schools online. But keeping schools open has proven difficult in areas where community spread of Covid-19 has surged.

Montgomery County, where Centerville is located, was recently updated to a Level 4 Public Emergency by the state's Public Health Advisory System, a designation that indicates ""severe exposure and spread."" Health officials recommend that residents leave home only for essential supplies and services. There have been 4,285 cases in the county in the past two weeks, a number that is almost certainly an undercount because of delays in test processing created by the Thanksgiving holiday. The county's intensive care units are nearly 86 percent full as of Dec. 3. Overall, nearly a third of ICU patients across the state have Covid-19, according to the most recent release from the state Health Department.

Dr. Nora Colburn, associate medical director for clinical epidemiology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said in a press release that non-Covid patients are increasingly being crowded out of the healthcare system.

A healthcare professional preprares to enter a Covid-19 patient's room in the ICU at Van Wert County Hospital in Van Wert, Ohio on Nov. 20, 2020. Megan Jelinger / AFP - Getty Images

""We are in crisis,"" Colburn said. ""Hospitals across Ohio are running out of beds, healthcare workers are burned out and stretched thin, and our hospitals are stressed to the extreme.""

Gov. Mike DeWine instituted a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. for three weeks beginning Nov. 17, which experts say is likely to have little effect on the spread of the coronavirus. Other states have also instituted coronavirus mitigation measures, which schools have tried to adapt to as they push to return to classrooms.

Private and parochial schools, which have been operating in person since late August, are starting to feel the crunch, as well. Archbishop Alter High School, a Catholic high school in Kettering, shifted the entire school to remote learning the Thursday before Thanksgiving after dozens of students were out because of quarantines and positive cases. Principal Lourdes Lambert said the goal was to keep all students on the same footing and resume in-person classes after the holiday.

The decisions made outside school walls will continue to affect the sustainability of in-person learning, even more so as cold weather forces people indoors, which Lambert said she believes was behind her school's increase in cases.

""More people are inside,"" Lambert said. ""I think that's why we're seeing an uptick in cases.""

Henderson, Centerville's superintendent, said he hopes to resume in-person learning next month but acknowledges that he worries about what conditions will be like then.

""Will things be much different in January? Our goal is to come back"" he said, but that's not entirely up to him or his staff, who have been following every safety protocol that's been recommended.

2020-12-06 19:31:05+00:00,92,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, sounded a dire alarm on Sunday amid spiking Covid-19 cases across America as she expressed frustration with government officials who ignore public health guidance as caseloads and deaths rise.

Speaking during an interview on NBC News' “Meet the Press,” Birx said that it’s especially frustrating to see governors and local officials refuse to enact the same mitigation strategies they used to successfully curb the virus’ spread in the summer.

“Right now, across the Sunbelt, we have governors and mayors who have cases equivalent to what they had in the summertime, yet aren’t putting in the same policies and mitigations that they put in the summer that they know changed the course of this pandemic,” Birx said.

“This is the worst event that this country will face not just from a public health side, yet we know what behaviors spread the virus and we know how to change those behaviors to stop spreading the virus.”

Government leaders have sent conflicting messages on the virus since it hit American shores: while public health officials have been fighting to help convince Americans to take the threat of the virus seriously and calling for an aggressive commitment to mitigation efforts, President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned both the severity of the virus and public health guidance meant to combat its spread.

And this month, the White House and State Department planned large indoor holiday parties despite warnings against indoor gatherings.

Birx, who has spent much of the year traveling to different communities as part of the attempt to fight the virus, added that she hears regularly from people all over the country who are mimicking “myths” downplaying the seriousness of it.

“I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don’t work, parroting back that we should work toward herd immunity, parroting back that gatherings don’t result in super-spreading events,” She said.

“And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong, and you can see the evidence base.”

While Birx did not directly address the president’s message, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who joined “Meet the Press” shortly after Birx, did.

He said that while most in government are “taking this more serious, the president is not, as part of his political posturing. It’s very dangerous, it’s extremely dangerous.”

Infections have accelerated across the country around the holiday season — new, daily caseloads have repeatedly surpassed 200,000 in recent days, with more than 2,200 new daily deaths each of the last few days. Overall, there has been 14.7 million coronavirus cases in America and 282,00 deaths, according to an NBC News analysis.

The new influx in cases has caused new strain on both the nation’s hospital and testing systems, and areas have begun implementing new stay-at-home orders in the hopes of easing that strain and blunting the accelerated spread of the virus.

Despite warnings from public health officials not to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, airports broke pandemic-era records as many appeared to still be gathering. Birx said that America will likely see the repercussions of those gatherings in the next week or two and cautioned that Americans cannot continue with the same mindset that they took to Thanksgiving travel.

“Every state across this country needs to increase their mitigation and every state needs to be critically informing their state population that the gatherings we saw in Thanksgiving will lead to a surge, it will happen this week and next week,” she said.

“We cannot go into the holiday season — Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza — with the same kind of attitude that: ‘Those gatherings don’t apply to me.’ They apply to everyone, if you don’t want to lose your grandparents, your aunt.”",MSNBC,"['virus', 'dont', 'health', 'birx', 'fighting', 'gatherings', 'officials', 'holiday', 'spread', 'myths', 'state', 'parroting', 'pandemics', 'public']",0

The deaths were at three nursing home facilities in Grant County, health officials said Thursday. They were men in their 70s, 80s, and 90s who had underlying health conditions, according to a press release by the Grant County Health District.

Four additional deaths are pending death certificate reviews.

The health department said it is looking into whether the deaths are linked to a Nov. 7 wedding in Ritzville, about 59 miles southwest of Spokane, but an investigation found that some staff members at the facilities had tested positive after attending the event.

Officials did not say how many staff members were guests at the wedding and a health department spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment on Saturday.

""Because staff in these facilities care for entire units, direct contact with associated patients is not known,"" the agency said.

The health department had previously said that the wedding was linked to 40 cases of coronavirus and outbreaks at a nursing home facility and a school. The more than 300 guests were asked to get tested and to quarantine.

At the time of the ceremony, Gov. Jay Inslee's executive order capped wedding receptions at 30 people, according to the Tri-City Herald.

""Our most vulnerable community members — elderly, immunocompromised, and those with chronic conditions — are especially at risk of complications due to a COVID-19 infection and we must continue to take measures to protect them from this disease.

The FBI said in a public service announcement Friday that the facility, Infinity Diagnostic Laboratory in Ventnor, was offering active virus tests in addition to antibody tests. The lab called it ""rapid 10-minute testing"" on a sign that was taken down Friday, NBC Philadelphia reported. Finger prick blood tests can detect Covid-19 antibodies, but only nasal or saliva tests should be used to diagnose active cases, the FBI said.

Brian Strahl of Margate said he paid for staff members at his business to be tested at the lab but felt wary of the results.

""I think giving fake, inaccurate tests just makes a bad situation 10 times worse,"" he told NBC Philadelphia. ""Because you're putting ... people at risk, and you're also giving people a false sense of security. I think it's horrible.""

2020-12-06 16:01:05+00:00,110,"The medical license of an Oregon doctor who refused to wear a face mask despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been revoked weeks after a video surfaced of him dismissing Covid-19 as a ""common cold.""

Steven LaTulippe made the comments Nov. 7 during a ""Stop the Steal"" rally in support of President Donald Trump outside the State Capitol in Salem.

""I want to expose what I call corona mania,"" LaTulippe said in a video posted on YouTube by the political group Multnomah County Republicans.

Less than a month later, on Dec. 3, the Oregon Medical Board issued an emergency suspension after finding that LaTulippe ""engaged in unprofessional conduct or dishonorable conduct,"" online records show.

According to the emergency suspension, LaTulippe in July allegedly told a patient who asked for guidance on when to get tested for the coronavirus that asymptomatic people should not be tested and that wearing a mask does not prevent transmission. LaTulippe directed the patient not to self-isolate because being around other people would provide immunity from Covid-19, according to the state board's documents.

The medical board also found that LaTulippe and his staff refused to wear masks in the clinic and urged patients to remove their own masks. Medical board investigators who visited LaTulippe said there were no screening procedures upon entering the premises and no hand sanitizer was available in the waiting area.

As a result of these findings, the medical board ruled that LaTulippe ""constitutes an immediate danger to the public, and presents a serious danger to the public health and safety.""

The suspension prevents LaTulippe, who was licensed in 2000, from practicing medicine anywhere in Oregon.

In a previous interview with NBC, LaTulippe said he believes there is ""bad science"" supporting guidance over wearing face masks when coming into contact with people outside of one's household.

""I have absolutely zero problems with infectivity, and I have completely successful treatments, so I ask, 'What is the problem?' Why would I be demonized if I know what I'm doing?"" he said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a mask to reduce transmission of the virus. A Nov. 20 report cited seven studies conducted in various settings that ""confirmed the benefit of universal masking in community level analyses.""

While the physician has refused to wear a facial covering, LaTulippe previously said he asked patients who believe they have Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus to wear one.

He said he established a protocol of seeing those patients at the end of the day after his other patients were gone and treated them in a back room that is disinfected before and after their visit.

""I'm very interested in sound medical practice, and I'm interested in good science,"" he has said. ""And when science and medicine become perverted with corrupt politics, then I'm up for a fight, and that's what made me go to that rally and say what I said.""",MSNBC,"['oregon', 'patients', 'wearing', 'board', 'revoked', 'refusal', 'science', 'medical', 'pandemic', 'masks', 'suspension', 'doctors', 'wear', 'latulippe', 'refused', 'license', 'mask']",0

The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Sometimes it’s the reagents needed to run tests, and other times it’s as simple as the plastic tips used on the pipettes.

“The shortages still exist,” said Miller, director of UNC Medical Center’s clinical microbiology lab. “Lab directors have been screaming about this for months.”

Labs across the country have been facing dire shortages of supplies as the number of Covid-19 tests being processed has skyrocketed. But with so many supplies directed toward Covid-19 testing, it's increasingly becoming more difficult for patients to get an accurate diagnosis for sexually transmitted infections, common but serious illnesses like pneumonia and other potentially life-threatening infections.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

A November survey by the American Society for Microbiology of 134 labs around the country found that more than half of them were experiencing shortages in the supplies used to test for bacteria that cause common diseases like strep throat and pneumonia. More than 65 percent of labs reported shortages for testing for STIs.

This week, Miller learned the reagents needed to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea were on back order for the next three weeks, she told NBC News. Now the lab, which serves hundreds of patients, can no longer do these tests.

“It’s hard for our providers to keep track of what we’re able to do on any given day,” Miller said. “Providers used to be able to ask for every kind of test in our lab and now they can’t. It’s affecting their ability to practice medicine quite honestly.”

Supplies for STI testing have been hit particularly hard, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a letter to doctors in September, advising them that if there are shortages in their region, they may need to start rationing tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, only giving them to people who are at higher risk.

“The goal of this guidance is to maximize the number of people diagnosed and treated for STIs, while prioritizing individuals most likely to experience complications, such as maternal transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease, or increased risk of HIV infection,” Dr. Laura Bachmann, chief medical officer for the CDC’s Division of STD Prevention, told NBC News in a statement.

Doctors at some Planned Parenthood clinics say when they’re experiencing shortages, they now have to diagnose some patients empirically, meaning based on clinical observations rather than a routine test. Since many STIs are often asymptomatic, that can can be particularly challenging — and dangerous for patients.

We’re expecting an explosion in STD rates that top where we were pre-Covid levels.

“I’ve never been able to not order a test,” said Dr. Krishna Upadhya, vice president of quality care and health equity at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “It’s very difficult as a health care provider to not have the tool you need to take the best care of your patients.”

Planned Parenthood doctors are still encouraging patients to come in for testing.

But public health experts fear the shortages could be causing too many people to go undiagnosed and unknowingly spread STIs, causing even more alarm since STI rates were already on the rise before the pandemic.

According to the latest CDC statistics, chlamydia cases have increased nearly 20 percent since 2014, gonorrhea cases are up more than 60 percent and syphilis is up a stunning 71 percent.

“We already had an out-of-control STD epidemic before Covid,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “We’re expecting an explosion in STD rates that top where we were pre-Covid levels.”

It's not just STI testing. Some labs now can't test for food-borne bacteria, like salmonella and E. coli.

“This is the public health crisis going on below the Covid public health crisis,” Miller said.

A few weeks ago, Miller’s lab couldn’t run the gold-standard test for the dangerous staph infection MRSA. They had to go back to an older method that isn’t as accurate.

Sudden shortages have forced TriCore Reference Laboratories, which serves thousands of people throughout New Mexico, to figure out new ways to do tests. That's caused delays in results for patients.

“We get supplies for today and, maybe, tomorrow,” said Karissa Culbreath, TriCore’s director of infectious diseases. “There are times we have people waiting at the loading dock for the delivery truck so we can run the tests for the needs for that day.”

The problem is going to get worse, Culbreath worries. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals and doctors were only treating Covid-19 patients, so there was less of a need for other types of tests.

But patient volumes have returned to normal, on top of a nationwide surge in Covid-19 cases.

“Now the entire country is a hot spot,"" Culbreath said. ""I only see relief as soon as we’re able to control the pandemic.”

The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Melania ""doesn't shake in her boots ever and she tells Donald exactly how she feels,"" says Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of the First Lady and ex-East Wing adviser.

Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Ah well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas — at least for a while.

2020-12-05 20:32:05+00:00,73,"Melinda Roellig, an art and music teacher in Clarksville, Indiana, had already prepared this year's batch of Christmas presents for her family before she died last month of Covid-19.

The gifts she gave as an annual tradition, a mix of store-bought and handmade, were purchased and created with thought and precision, including her paintings, which were based on a shared memory with the recipient. Family members in Indiana and South Carolina looked forward to unwrapping them every year.

""She put her heart into it, and it just makes you smile because you know how much she cares about you and loves you,"" said Alexandra Roellig, Melinda's half sister. ""I think it's gonna be hard to open them [this year]. I don't know if I want to open them or not, because it's bittersweet.""

Roellig would have turned 38 on Sunday, another bittersweet marker in a holiday season full of them.

She died on Nov. 15, one week after first developing a fever, apparently hiding the full extent of her condition from her loved ones as she struggled with racking coughs and ragged breathing over the next few days. She avoided a trip to the hospital because she was unsure if her insurance would cover the costs, family members said.

""I didn’t know how bad she was during the week because she didn’t call me,"" said her mother, Victoria Straub, a traveling nurse who works with Covid-19 patients and was out of town most of that week. ""If I would have known, I would have driven home and driven her to the hospital myself.""

When Straub went to check on her daughter on Nov. 15, she found Roellig struggling to breathe and called 911. Roellig died in the ambulance, before the results of her Covid-19 test taken three days earlier came back, Straub said.

""When I got sick, she'd always come over and cook and take care of me,"" said her boyfriend, Tim Tatum, who did not see much of Roellig after the school year began because, as caretaker to his 88-year-old mother, he needed to prevent possible virus exposure. ""But she wasn't the type of person to complain when she wasn't feeling well.""

The family prefers not to think about the last seven days of Roellig's life. They would rather focus on the 1,979 weeks that preceded it.

Born on Dec. 6, 1982, in Scotland — where her father, James, was stationed with the U.S. Navy — Roellig displayed her musical flair early on. Straub remembers a fateful drive to her own parents’ home when the family moved back to the U.S.

“She was singing in the car and had perfect pitch,” said Straub, a former choir singer. “She was just 2 or 3 years old at the time, and I just appreciated her. From the get-go she could hear that pitch. There are so many kids that can’t.”

No one in the family was surprised when she gravitated toward her high school marching band or when she took her trumpet and passion with her to the University of Louisville, where she majored in music.

When Roellig wasn’t making music, she was immersed in art, proving as deft with the paintbrush as she was with her instrument.

“I know she worked hard, but it's like it just came to her,"" said Erin Hester, a friend and bandmate in high school and college, where they bonded over a shared love for ""Harry Potter."" ""It was like she just woke up with the superpower to play these beautiful sounds out of the trumpet and then make all these beautiful pictures and portraits.”

In college, Roellig became interested in teaching those skills, Hester said.

""She knew she wanted to share a gift with as many people as she could,"" Hester said.

Roellig's first student may have been her younger sister, Alexandra Roellig, who looked forward to the times when their father would take her to see the marching band.

""I thought it was so cool watching her perform and marching, and then I wanted to be like my sister,"" said Alexandra, who collected messages from her sister and other band members in a journal. ""So I followed her steps in a way, and I went in to do marching band and music, just like her.""

After earning a master's in music, Roellig moved to Charlestown, Indiana, then to Washington state before returning to Indiana, near her mother's home in Clarksville.

When her music-teaching position at the public school where she worked was cut, Roellig approached Rock Creek Community Academy, a new K-12 charter school in nearby Sellersburg that did not yet have a music program. But Principal Sara Hauselman hired her to teach art.

""You can't say this about very many teachers — nobody's perfect, everybody doesn't do everything right — but I never saw a kid that did not want to be in her class and didn't love it once they got in it,"" Hauselman said. ""Whatever they could do, she just would encourage them.""

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Roellig taught choir when she could, often before or after school, and provided a sounding board for her students, said Carey Walls, a former student who learned the saxophone and perseverance in her classroom.

""She changed my life,"" said Walls, who graduated from Rock Creek in 2018 and is studying psychology at Purdue University. ""We always knew we could go to Ms. R and she would have our backs.

""She really just gave me that foundation that this may not be the best situation right now, but it will get better. She taught me to keep up the fight.""

Roellig's family is especially proud of that legacy as a teacher. ""She was special, and she cared,"" Straub said.

In Hester's last call with Roellig, shortly before Halloween, they talked about possibly traveling together to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park in Florida or the ""Harry Potter"" exhibit near London.

Roellig is survived by her mother, stepfather and stepsiblings in Indiana; and her father, stepmother, half sister, brother and two nieces who she doted on in South Carolina.

Straub, whose 90-year-old husband, Ed, is recovering from Covid-19, said she hopes her daughter's death will draw attention to the need for masks and social distancing in a state where such measures are optional.

As Christmas approaches, Roellig's loved ones said they will celebrate her life as best they can. Tatum plans to buy a Christmas tree in her honor that he will decorate, a tradition that meant a lot to her.

""I hope she can look down and see that, and it'll make her happy that she was able to get me to buy one,"" he said.",MSNBC,"['teacher', 'family', 'beloved', 'loss', 'straub', 'know', 'void', 'cared', 'marching', 'indiana', 'school', 'alexandra', 'special', 'sister', 'music', 'art', 'leaves', 'roellig']",0

Covid-19 testing capacity strained by surge in demand As Covid-19 cases surge across the United States, the outbreak is threatening to overwhelm the testing capacity at facilities that have spent months and millions of dollars to ramp up their capabilities, according to laboratory directors in six states. Dr. Geoffrey Baird, who oversees all Covid-19 diagnostics as the acting chair of the University of Washington’s laboratory system, said he spent an estimated $30 million earlier this year to build up its labs, which now boast a total workforce of 1,500 — a tenth of that hired to focus on Covid-19. But even that operation is now struggling to handle the surge. Read the full article here. Share this -

Moscow rolls out mass Covid-19 vaccinations Moscow began distributing its coronavirus vaccine, the Sputnik V COVID-19 shot, in 70 clinics on Saturday, the city's coronavirus taskforce said, beginning Russia's first mass vaccination program. The taskforce said the Russian-made vaccine would be available first to doctors and medical staff then teachers and social workers, as they ran the highest risk of exposure to the virus. The age for those receiving shots is capped at 60, while those with certain underlying health conditions, pregnant women and people who have had a respiratory illness in the past two weeks are also barred from vaccination. Moscow has been the epicenter of Russia's coronavirus outbreak and registered 7,993 new cases overnight, up from 6,868 a day before. Share this -

2020-12-05 14:01:03+00:00,57,"As of Monday, radiologist Scott W. Atlas is no longer deranging the federal government’s pandemic response, and we will all be the better for it.

President Donald Trump first saw Atlas, who is a senior fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution, on Fox News. Once ensconced in the White House as an official coronavirus adviser, Atlas was more than happy to gloss over Trump’s Covid-19 hunches with a goo of science-y language and “own the libs” dudgeon.

Atlas had his own hunches, some of which turned out to be sound (he was a strong advocate for keeping schools open), some of which turned out to be dangerous (in the face of mounting evidence that masks work, he insisted the opposite), and some of which turned out to be disastrous (he believed that increased testing misallocated resources, that college students should be left to their own devices, and that the president should both resist bureaucratic efforts to expand testing in the fall and encourage efforts to resist state lockdowns as cases rose).

In reality, a lack of testing hobbled state efforts to curtail a predictable rise in cases as college students going back and forth between home and school spread the virus, largely because many people who spread the virus don’t show symptoms. Herd immunity, a controversial Covid-19 containment strategy that Atlas pushed early on, is clearly not something this diagnostic radiologist understands. It turns out that the virus is orders of magnitude deadlier than Atlas first thought, and that Americans do not want the virus to tear through communities unchecked until we get vaccinated.

Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

But Atlas’ many mistakes are not the problem — not exactly. Scientists get things wrong, and plenty have made mistakes during this pandemic. But the difference between Scott Atlas and most scientists is that most scientists adjust their beliefs to fit the evidence, whereas Atlas simply dug in.

A scientist should approach public communication humbly, as a privilege. Atlas approached it as an exercise in partisanship. Scientists are already facing an uphill battle because the public is often persuaded by loud, repetitive, certainty-hardened voices. Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

Technically, he was appointed a “special government employee,” which administrations past have used to bring unique experts into government service during emergencies. The day he was named to the coronavirus task force, Trump called him “a very famous man who’s also very highly respected.” (He was marginally respected by a specific conservative clique and only Fox News-famous.)

A scientist should approach public communication humbly, as a privilege. Atlas approached it as an exercise in partisanship.

I can’t see into Atlas’s brain, but I can run an experiment on myself. If I was asked to serve on the coronavirus task force, a position to which I would bring no unique perspective or expertise, what would I do? I can fake it as well as anyone, and yeah, I’d be close to the seat of power. Power and influence are seductive, as is the chance to help influence the course of history and to know stuff before other people do. A job like that would most likely make me feel, in the moment, like I was famous and highly respected.

But I’d like to think I would resist it. Because what good is fame if you can’t live with the broader consequences of your actions?

Atlas is now famous. He will never not be famous. He’s so famous he has developed a celebrity-thin skin, which tends to happen: The more pretend power you get, the more your ego defenses become vulnerable to criticism. I wonder if there’s some lesson in that.

In one of his last television appearances, Atlas correctly noted that elderly Americans are suffering in isolation, and that government lockdowns can be harmful. Then he said that Americans should gather with their relatives for Thanksgiving because “for many people it might be their final Thanksgiving, believe it or not.”

I could try to spell out the illogic and cruelty in this statement. Or I could simply ask you to imagine a healthy grandmother who contracts Covid-19 because her family listened to Atlas’s advice, then suffers a lonely and painful deterioration in December and dies before Christmas. And then, two weeks later, your grandmother’s best friend, who didn’t get visitors during Thanksgiving, gets the first shot of a vaccine.",MSNBC,"['turned', 'suffering', 'virus', 'testing', 'famous', 'owning', 'atlas', 'thanksgiving', 'resist', 'paid', 'scott', 'price', 'americans', 'libs', 'scientists', 'public', 'cared', 'covid']",0

And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

2020-12-05 05:55:01+00:00,146,"The medical license of an Oregon doctor who refused to wear a face mask despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been revoked weeks after a video surfaced of him dismissing Covid-19 as a ""common cold.""

Steven LaTulippe made the comments Nov. 7 during a ""Stop the Steal"" rally in support of President Donald Trump outside the State Capitol in Salem.

""I want to expose what I call corona mania,"" LaTulippe said in a video posted on YouTube by the political group Multnomah County Republicans.

Less than a month later, on Dec. 3, the Oregon Medical Board issued an emergency suspension after finding that LaTulippe ""engaged in unprofessional conduct or dishonorable conduct,"" online records show.

According to the emergency suspension, LaTulippe in July allegedly told a patient who asked for guidance on when to get tested for the coronavirus that asymptomatic people should not be tested and that wearing a mask does not prevent transmission. LaTulippe directed the patient not to self-isolate because being around other people would provide immunity from Covid-19, according to the state board's documents.

The medical board also found that LaTulippe and his staff refused to wear masks in the clinic and urged patients to remove their own masks. Medical board investigators who visited LaTulippe said there were no screening procedures upon entering the premises and no hand sanitizer was available in the waiting area.

As a result of these findings, the medical board ruled that LaTulippe ""constitutes an immediate danger to the public, and presents a serious danger to the public health and safety.""

The suspension prevents LaTulippe, who was licensed in 2000, from practicing medicine anywhere in Oregon.

In a previous interview with NBC, LaTulippe said he believes there is ""bad science"" supporting guidance over wearing face masks when coming into contact with people outside of one's household.

""I have absolutely zero problems with infectivity, and I have completely successful treatments, so I ask, 'What is the problem?' Why would I be demonized if I know what I'm doing?"" he said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a mask to reduce transmission of the virus. A Nov. 20 report cited seven studies conducted in various settings that ""confirmed the benefit of universal masking in community level analyses.""

While the physician has refused to wear a facial covering, LaTulippe previously said he asked patients who believe they have Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus to wear one.

He said he established a protocol of seeing those patients at the end of the day after his other patients were gone and treated them in a back room that is disinfected before and after their visit.

""I'm very interested in sound medical practice, and I'm interested in good science,"" he has said. ""And when science and medicine become perverted with corrupt politics, then I'm up for a fight, and that's what made me go to that rally and say what I said.""",MSNBC,"['oregon', 'patients', 'wearing', 'board', 'revoked', 'refusal', 'science', 'medical', 'pandemic', 'masks', 'suspension', 'doctors', 'wear', 'latulippe', 'refused', 'license', 'mask']",0

CDC emphasizes 'universal mask use' — even indoors The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday emphasized that Americans should wear masks everywhere and anywhere — even indoors. The advice came in a ""Summary of Guidance"" that addresses how the United States can fight back against a deadly December spike in Covid-19 cases. ""Face mask use is most important in indoor spaces and outdoors when physical distance of [plus or minus] 6 feet cannot be maintained,"" the CDC said Friday. ""Within households, face masks should be used when a member of the household is infected or has had recent potential COVID-19 exposure."" CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the guidance didn't represent new advice, but he admitted its emphasis on indoor use could be novel for many Americans. ""We’ve been urging universal mask use since July,"" he said. Share this -

Puerto Rico seeks to arrest mainland tourist who refused mask SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A judge on Friday ordered the arrest of a tourist from the U.S. mainland who is accused of attacking a National Guard trooper at Puerto Rico’s airport after refusing to wear a face mask as required under pandemic restrictions. The suspect was identified as 31-year-old Adrien Williams. He faces charges including assault in the Nov. 28 incident caught on video that went viral. Brenda Quijano, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice, said that Williams lives in Lake Elsinore, California, but was born in South Carolina. His current whereabouts were not known. The incident angered many Puerto Ricans who have repeatedly complained about tourists refusing to wear face masks as the U.S. territory faces a record number of coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths, burdening an already fragile health system. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 51,600 confirmed cases and more than 1,100 deaths. Share this -

China poised to deliver 600 million vaccine doses, state media says Chinese state media claimed Friday that the government could deliver 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the month. Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told China's Global Times that the country is likely to have more vaccine production lines than the United States and that it has already switched some influenza vaccine facilities to Covid-19 labs. ""There should be no supply shortage on the industrial chain of vaccine production in China,"" added Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based expert on vaccine and immunology.

Interest accrual will also be paused during this period. Federal student loan borrowers will still have the option of paying down debt if they chose and will benefit from a 0 percent interest charge. “The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges for many students and borrowers, and this temporary pause in payments will help those who have been impacted,” DeVos said in a statement. “The added time also allows Congress to do its job and determine what measures it believes are necessary and appropriate.

Bay Area adheres to stay-at-home orders before state mandates them Five counties in California's Bay Area announced Friday they would impose regional shutdown orders ahead of an expected move by the state to do the same. Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties and the city of Berkeley said the measures, including closing bars, wineries, hair salons and other nonessential businesses, will begin Sunday in most areas. In Alameda County, the limitations will start Monday, and in Marin, they will take effect Tuesday, Bay Area officials said. The orders are expected to remain in place until Jan. 4. They include an end to restaurant dining and 20 percent capacity for essential retail stores. Officials said the region's intensive care capacity had not yet fallen below 15 percent, the trigger for the state's stricter stay-at-home orders announced Thursday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Families on the brink fear what’s next as pandemic benefits expire The pandemic has pushed millions of Americans to the cliff’s edge, with the ground crumbling at year’s end without further stimulus action by Congress. When federal emergency coronavirus relief protections expire, some as soon as the day after Christmas, 13 million Americans will lose their jobless benefits. Many more face eviction, or will find student debt has come due. Nine months in to the pandemic, the latest jobs report showed the economy in November gained a paltry 245,000 jobs out of the 10 million yet to be recovered, underscoring the need for swift remedy. Relief can’t come soon enough for millions of families. Kelly Ann Hotchkin from Hamilton, New Jersey, was out of work for 7 months and went back to work for a month and a half, only to be furloughed again. Her husband is out of work too. They have four kids from ages 2 to 13. She only gets $231 a week in unemployment. “We've gone through every penny of our savings, my husband is going through the appeals process for unemployment now,” Hotchkin told NBC News in an online message. “I have zero ability to provide even one gift for our kids' Christmas this year and apparently the government’s gift to us is to completely screw us the day after Christmas.” Share this -

Speaker Pelosi says there is 'momentum' to reach Covid relief deal WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Friday that there is ""momentum"" on Capitol Hill to reach a deal on coronavirus relief, further optimism that legislation could be approved before the end of the year. ""There is momentum,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""I am pleased that the tone of our conversation is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done."" The deal would provide for augmented unemployment payments through March but would not send another round of checks to the nation. Pelosi said she spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Thursday about attaching the Covid-19 relief to the government funding bill, which needs to be passed by Dec. 11 to avoid a shutdown. That means lawmakers negotiating another round of aid are working on a tight deadline after months of deadlocked negotiations. Read more on NBCNews.com. Share this -

Health official in Kansas target of anger, harassment over proposed Covid measures Rural Kansas doctor facing community pushback for Covid safety protocols Dec. 4, 2020 04:07 FREDONIA, Kan. — In this rural town of 2,500 people, residents are used to pitching in and coming together in a crisis. This pandemic is different. Throughout the state, politics and anger are infecting the public health discourse as health officials find that they're fighting not only Covid-19 but also threats and harassment from ""anti-maskers"" and others who refuse to follow safety guidelines. Dr. Jennifer Bacani McKenney, the Wilson County health officer, a school board member and the wife of Fredonia Mayor Bob McKenney, was eager to lead her community's Covid-19 response. But nine months after the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Kansas, she finishes many workdays in tears. McKenney said community members have driven by her home and videotaped her, posted insulting messages about her on Facebook and pushed for her to lose her job. ""I think there's a lot of fear. And there's so much unknown,"" she said. ""People want to blame something, and they can't blame a virus that is too small to be seen. So they blame people like me.""

South Korea study highlights risks of indoor dining A study conducted by scientists in South Korea traced the origins of one local outbreak and showed how the coronavirus spread in a restaurant between the individuals without close contact and at a greater distance than the 6 feet that is recommended for social distancing. Researchers examined the chain of transmission from a June 17 outbreak in a restaurant in the city of Jeonju, in western South Korea. Three Covid-19 infections resulted from the incident. In their study, the scientists demonstrated that the virus was likely spread through long-distance droplet transmission, which occurs when virus-filled particles are ejected from the mouth or nose as a person speaks, coughs or sneezes. In the recent study, published online Nov. 23 in the Journal of Korean Medical Science, the scientists showed how airflow in the restaurant from “ceiling-type air conditioners” enabled droplet transmission at distances of more than 21 feet. In one case, the infected person overlapped with a diner for only five minutes who later tested positive, according to the study. The results show the potential risk of dining inside restaurants and attending other indoor gatherings, and also demonstrate the limitations of social distancing guidelines from the CDC and WHO. “We share these investigation results as a reference to update guidelines involving prevention, tracing, and quarantine for control of this pandemic infectious disease,” the scientists wrote in the study.

U.S. economy gains just 245,000 jobs in final report of 2020 as recovery stalls with Covid surging The U.S. economy added 245,000 jobs in November, as the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had predicted the economy would gain around 440,000 jobs. Amid a fresh surge in coronavirus cases and a new round of shutdowns, Friday's figure represents the fifth straight month of slowing job gains. The sharp decline represents the lowest monthly total since the economy started its halting recovery. BLS unemployment data is collected on or around the 12th of the month, but more recent metrics underscore how vulnerable the economy is to a “super-surge” of coronavirus infections around the holidays that could send people back into their homes and shutter businesses. Although the promise of a vaccine has raised the hopes of investors, public health officials warn that a large-scale rollout sufficient to protect much of the population could still be months away. “It's hard to see exactly when the recovery can really start,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter.com. “The start of vaccination is not enough. We need people to feel totally safe gathering in large numbers."" Share this -

The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Melania ""doesn't shake in her boots ever and she tells Donald exactly how she feels,"" says Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of the First Lady and ex-East Wing adviser.

She believes ""if he's going to do it, he better do it right and he better do it with brass knuckles."" pic.twitter.com/biXV2SmbBE — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) October 2, 2020

We got precious little time to savor the audio before the 2020 news cyclone swept it away. Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.

ok, FINE, we'll auto-tune the ""Christmas stuff"" thing into a carol 🎅🎄🦌 pic.twitter.com/VEprOK3QOP — The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) October 2, 2020

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Ah well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas — at least for a while.

One of the few joys we’ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania’s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.

We know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian — but less in the ""A Christmas Carol"" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the ""this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide"" sense.

Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday décor ""ranked from most to least haunted."" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.

While this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.

In a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.

""I'm working like — my ass off — on Christmas stuff, you know?"" Melania could be heard saying. ""Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?

""Then I do it,"" she continued. ""And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?""

Melania ""doesn't shake in her boots ever and she tells Donald exactly how she feels,"" says Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of the First Lady and ex-East Wing adviser.

Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.

Thankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?

Those in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.

Who’s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?

""If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.

Melania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. ""Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,"" she said in a statement.

""All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,"" she said. ""It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.""

And it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.

All in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.

So, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess — and this is, in fact, a total guess — I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.

Ah well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas — at least for a while.

2020-12-04 13:39:52+00:00,83,"The U.S. economy added 245,000 jobs in November, as the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had predicted the economy would gain around 440,000 jobs.

Amid a fresh surge in coronavirus cases and a new round of shutdowns, Friday's figure represents the fifth straight month of decelerating job gains. It is by far the lowest monthly total since the economy started its halting recovery.

""Today’s report is both a wakeup call and a warning,"" said Nick Bunker, Indeed economic research director. ""Coronavirus cases are surging throughout the country and several federal relief programs are set to expire this month. Progress in the labor market has slowed at the worst possible time. We might be optimistic about the spring, but the winter could bring another round of economic pain.""

BLS unemployment data is collected on or around the 12th of the month, but more recent metrics underscore how vulnerable the economy is to a “super-surge” of coronavirus infections around the holidays that could send people back into their homes and shutter businesses.

""This surge in cases has the potential to significantly slow down overall economic activity and therefore employers’ desire to hire,"" said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at Indeed.com. “The pullback from those households could slow consumption and therefore overall economic growth,” he said — a major risk given that consumer spending fuels some two-thirds of economic activity.

The BLS data came two days after a lackluster report on jobs growth by payroll processor ADP in conjunction with Moody’s Analytics, which found that employers added 307,000 private sector jobs last month, in contrast to the 475,000 expected among economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

“ADP’s employment report was somewhat disappointing,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter.com. ""Ideally, we’d be adding 2 million a month and really climbing out of this recession.""

Two of the past three weekly jobless claims reports showed increases, reversing a months-long trend of improvements — but seeing how many people are losing jobs is only part of the equation, said Dan North, chief economist, North America at Euler Hermes.

“It does not tell the other half, which is the number of people becoming employed. You would expect with the increase in lockdowns, you would see fewer people becoming employed as well.”

Data bears this out: According to Glassdoor.com, job openings fell by 2.5 percent on a month-to-month basis and are still down by more than 10 percent from pre-pandemic levels.

""It is instructive that this decline has been very broad, which points to a repeat of what we saw in the spring, but on a smaller scale,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. ""Basically, every major group except for health care has seen job openings fall,"" he said.

Since job openings are a forward-looking metric, economists are looking ahead with some trepidation to the December jobs report, which will be released just after the new year.

“Ultimately, the virus is in the driver’s seat. The virus is what determines the trajectory of the recovery,” Zhao said.

The profound distortion in usual hiring patterns that typically take place around the holidays will make forecasting difficult, North said. “There has been much less holiday hiring than the seasonal adjustments would normally account for, so that would hold the December… jobs numbers down as well,” he said.

Although the promise of a vaccine has raised the hopes of investors, public health officials warn that a large-scale rollout sufficient to protect much of the population could still be months away.

“It's hard to see exactly when the recovery can really start,” Pollak said. “The start of vaccination is not enough. We need people to feel totally safe gathering in large numbers.”",MSNBC,"['surging', 'recovery', 'job', 'openings', 'north', 'economists', 'labor', 'stalls', 'economic', 'economy', '245000', 'gains', 'month', 'final', 'jobs', 'covid', 'report']",0

Covid now leading cause of death in U.S., researchers say Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States, researchers at the University of Washington said Friday. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said in a briefing that the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the last week, 11,820, ""makes COVID-19 the No. 1 cause of death in the United States of America this week."" The virus topped the nation's perennial No. 1 killer, ischemic heart disease, which was said to be responsible for 10,724 deaths in the last week, according to the Washington team. For the year, Covid-19 was projected to end up in second place, behind ischemic heart disease, researchers said. Tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer was in third place. The institute said it estimates 15 percent of Americans have been infected. The United States recorded 2,802 virus-related deaths Thursday and 279,224 since the pandemic began, according to an NBC News tally. ""Our model projects 539,000 cumulative deaths on April 1, 2021,"" the briefing states. ""Daily deaths will peak at 3,000 in mid-January."" Share this -

""Face mask use is most important in indoor spaces and outdoors when physical distance of [plus or minus] 6 feet cannot be maintained,"" the CDC said Friday. ""Within households, face masks should be used when a member of the household is infected or has had recent potential COVID-19 exposure."" CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the guidance didn't represent new advice, but he admitted its emphasis on indoor use could be novel for many Americans. ""We’ve been urging universal mask use since July,"" he said. Share this -

Puerto Rico seeks to arrest mainland tourist who refused mask SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A judge on Friday ordered the arrest of a tourist from the U.S. mainland who is accused of attacking a National Guard trooper at Puerto Rico’s airport after refusing to wear a face mask as required under pandemic restrictions. The suspect was identified as 31-year-old Adrien Williams. He faces charges including assault in the Nov. 28 incident caught on video that went viral. Brenda Quijano, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice, said that Williams lives in Lake Elsinore, California, but was born in South Carolina. His current whereabouts were not known. The incident angered many Puerto Ricans who have repeatedly complained about tourists refusing to wear face masks as the U.S. territory faces a record number of coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths, burdening an already fragile health system. The island of 3.2 million people has reported more than 51,600 confirmed cases and more than 1,100 deaths. Share this -

""There should be no supply shortage on the industrial chain of vaccine production in China,"" added Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based expert on vaccine and immunology.

Federal student loan borrowers will still have the option of paying down debt if they chose and will benefit from a 0 percent interest charge. “The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges for many students and borrowers, and this temporary pause in payments will help those who have been impacted,” DeVos said in a statement. “The added time also allows Congress to do its job and determine what measures it believes are necessary and appropriate. The Congress, not the Executive Branch, is in charge of student loan policy.” Share this -

Bay Area adheres to stay-at-home orders before state mandates them Five counties in California's Bay Area announced Friday they would impose regional shutdown orders ahead of an expected move by the state to do the same. Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties and the city of Berkeley said the measures, including closing bars, wineries, hair salons and other nonessential businesses, will begin Sunday in most areas. In Alameda County, the limitations will start Monday, and in Marin, they will take effect Tuesday, Bay Area officials said. The orders are expected to remain in place until Jan. 4. They include an end to restaurant dining and 20 percent capacity for essential retail stores. Officials said the region's intensive care capacity had not yet fallen below 15 percent, the trigger for the state's stricter stay-at-home orders announced Thursday by Gov. Gavin Newsom. But Bay Area officials said in a statement that reaching threshold was ""inevitable."" San Francisco Mayor London Breed tweeted Friday, ""We're on pace to run out of hospital beds to care for patients the day after Christmas. We must turn this around now."" Share this -

Los Angeles County rolls out rapid home test Public health officials in Los Angeles County announced Friday that a rapid home test will be available by mail to qualified people. The FDA-approved home test developed by Fulgent Genetics can be mailed to residents within two days of a request. After the test is taken, it can be dropped in a FedEx box and results returned by email in another two days, county officials said in a statement. The home test will be available through Jan. 15. ""It aims to help address the current surge in demand for testing and reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the holiday season when people may risk exposure,"" the county said. Qualified individuals include those with Covid-19 symptoms, those recently in close contact with a coronavirus patient, or a senior or person with disabilities who might have been exposed but who can't easily get to a testing site. The Department of Public Health recorded the highest daily number of new cases Tuesday: 7,854. Share this -

Families on the brink fear what’s next as pandemic benefits expire The pandemic has pushed millions of Americans to the cliff’s edge, with the ground crumbling at year’s end without further stimulus action by Congress. When federal emergency coronavirus relief protections expire, some as soon as the day after Christmas, 13 million Americans will lose their jobless benefits. Many more face eviction, or will find student debt has come due. Nine months in to the pandemic, the latest jobs report showed the economy in November gained a paltry 245,000 jobs out of the 10 million yet to be recovered, underscoring the need for swift remedy. Relief can’t come soon enough for millions of families. Kelly Ann Hotchkin from Hamilton, New Jersey, was out of work for 7 months and went back to work for a month and a half, only to be furloughed again. Her husband is out of work too. They have four kids from ages 2 to 13. She only gets $231 a week in unemployment. “We've gone through every penny of our savings, my husband is going through the appeals process for unemployment now,” Hotchkin told NBC News in an online message. “I have zero ability to provide even one gift for our kids' Christmas this year and apparently the government’s gift to us is to completely screw us the day after Christmas.” Share this -

Baltimore families connect homes with holiday lights in place of in-person gatherings A group of Baltimore families is using lights in place of in-person gatherings to connect with each other this holiday season. Leabe Commisso said her block usually throws Christmas and New Year’s parties but had to call off that tradition this year due to the pandemic. Instead, families who live in the neighborhood have connected their homes by stringing Christmas lights together, with a sign on the street that says, “Love lives here.” A group of Baltimore families have strung their holiday lights together to connect symbolically during the pandemic. 300 Block of Dunkirk “You start off thinking you’re going to put lights up across the street and then everyone else starts doing it,” Commisso told NBC News. “Then you find yourself spending an entire weekend watching all the people you live with and love engineer the most beautiful experience ever.

NFL further limits player access to facilities amid recent outbreaks The NFL is further limiting player access to team facilities as it attempts to enhance safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a memo sent to the 32 clubs and obtained by The Associated Press, teams must close their facilities for two days after games, with some exceptions. Beginning Monday, that all teams playing on a Sunday must close those facilities the next two days — except for clubs playing on the subsequent Thursday. Only players needing medical attention for injuries or in rehab programs may enter the team complex. Coaches can access the facility but must work in their own offices and can't conduct meetings except virtually. Share this -

Speaker Pelosi says there is 'momentum' to reach Covid relief deal WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Friday that there is ""momentum"" on Capitol Hill to reach a deal on coronavirus relief, further optimism that legislation could be approved before the end of the year. ""There is momentum,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""I am pleased that the tone of our conversation is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done."" The deal would provide for augmented unemployment payments through March but would not send another round of checks to the nation. Pelosi said she spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Thursday about attaching the Covid-19 relief to the government funding bill, which needs to be passed by Dec. 11 to avoid a shutdown. That means lawmakers negotiating another round of aid are working on a tight deadline after months of deadlocked negotiations. Read more on NBCNews.com. Share this -

Health official in Kansas target of anger, harassment over proposed Covid measures Rural Kansas doctor facing community pushback for Covid safety protocols Dec. 4, 2020 04:07 FREDONIA, Kan. — In this rural town of 2,500 people, residents are used to pitching in and coming together in a crisis. This pandemic is different. Throughout the state, politics and anger are infecting the public health discourse as health officials find that they're fighting not only Covid-19 but also threats and harassment from ""anti-maskers"" and others who refuse to follow safety guidelines. Dr. Jennifer Bacani McKenney, the Wilson County health officer, a school board member and the wife of Fredonia Mayor Bob McKenney, was eager to lead her community's Covid-19 response. But nine months after the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Kansas, she finishes many workdays in tears. McKenney said community members have driven by her home and videotaped her, posted insulting messages about her on Facebook and pushed for her to lose her job. ""I think there's a lot of fear. And there's so much unknown,"" she said. ""People want to blame something, and they can't blame a virus that is too small to be seen. So they blame people like me.""

South Korea study highlights risks of indoor dining A study conducted by scientists in South Korea traced the origins of one local outbreak and showed how the coronavirus spread in a restaurant between the individuals without close contact and at a greater distance than the 6 feet that is recommended for social distancing. Researchers examined the chain of transmission from a June 17 outbreak in a restaurant in the city of Jeonju, in western South Korea. Three Covid-19 infections resulted from the incident. In their study, the scientists demonstrated that the virus was likely spread through long-distance droplet transmission, which occurs when virus-filled particles are ejected from the mouth or nose as a person speaks, coughs or sneezes. In the recent study, published online Nov. 23 in the Journal of Korean Medical Science, the scientists showed how airflow in the restaurant from “ceiling-type air conditioners” enabled droplet transmission at distances of more than 21 feet. In one case, the infected person overlapped with a diner for only five minutes who later tested positive, according to the study. The results show the potential risk of dining inside restaurants and attending other indoor gatherings, and also demonstrate the limitations of social distancing guidelines from the CDC and WHO. “We share these investigation results as a reference to update guidelines involving prevention, tracing, and quarantine for control of this pandemic infectious disease,” the scientists wrote in the study.

U.S. economy gains just 245,000 jobs in final report of 2020 as recovery stalls with Covid surging The U.S. economy added 245,000 jobs in November, as the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had predicted the economy would gain around 440,000 jobs. Amid a fresh surge in coronavirus cases and a new round of shutdowns, Friday's figure represents the fifth straight month of slowing job gains. The sharp decline represents the lowest monthly total since the economy started its halting recovery. BLS unemployment data is collected on or around the 12th of the month, but more recent metrics underscore how vulnerable the economy is to a “super-surge” of coronavirus infections around the holidays that could send people back into their homes and shutter businesses. Although the promise of a vaccine has raised the hopes of investors, public health officials warn that a large-scale rollout sufficient to protect much of the population could still be months away. “It's hard to see exactly when the recovery can really start,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter.com. “The start of vaccination is not enough. We need people to feel totally safe gathering in large numbers."" Share this -

2020-12-03 22:33:04+00:00,90,"As of Monday, radiologist Scott W. Atlas is no longer deranging the federal government’s pandemic response, and we will all be the better for it.

President Donald Trump first saw Atlas, who is a senior fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution, on Fox News. Once ensconced in the White House as an official coronavirus adviser, Atlas was more than happy to gloss over Trump’s Covid-19 hunches with a goo of science-y language and “own the libs” dudgeon.

Atlas had his own hunches, some of which turned out to be sound (he was a strong advocate for keeping schools open), some of which turned out to be dangerous (in the face of mounting evidence that masks work, he insisted the opposite), and some of which turned out to be disastrous (he believed that increased testing misallocated resources, that college students should be left to their own devices, and that the president should both resist bureaucratic efforts to expand testing in the fall and encourage efforts to resist state lockdowns as cases rose).

In reality, a lack of testing hobbled state efforts to curtail a predictable rise in cases as college students going back and forth between home and school spread the virus, largely because many people who spread the virus don’t show symptoms. Herd immunity, a controversial Covid-19 containment strategy that Atlas pushed early on, is clearly not something this diagnostic radiologist understands. It turns out that the virus is orders of magnitude deadlier than Atlas first thought, and that Americans do not want the virus to tear through communities unchecked until we get vaccinated.

Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

But Atlas’ many mistakes are not the problem — not exactly. Scientists get things wrong, and plenty have made mistakes during this pandemic. But the difference between Scott Atlas and most scientists is that most scientists adjust their beliefs to fit the evidence, whereas Atlas simply dug in.

A scientist should approach public communication humbly, as a privilege. Atlas approached it as an exercise in partisanship. Scientists are already facing an uphill battle because the public is often persuaded by loud, repetitive, certainty-hardened voices. Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

Technically, he was appointed a “special government employee,” which administrations past have used to bring unique experts into government service during emergencies. The day he was named to the coronavirus task force, Trump called him “a very famous man who’s also very highly respected.” (He was marginally respected by a specific conservative clique and only Fox News-famous.)

A scientist should approach public communication humbly, as a privilege. Atlas approached it as an exercise in partisanship.

I can’t see into Atlas’s brain, but I can run an experiment on myself. If I was asked to serve on the coronavirus task force, a position to which I would bring no unique perspective or expertise, what would I do? I can fake it as well as anyone, and yeah, I’d be close to the seat of power. Power and influence are seductive, as is the chance to help influence the course of history and to know stuff before other people do. A job like that would most likely make me feel, in the moment, like I was famous and highly respected.

But I’d like to think I would resist it. Because what good is fame if you can’t live with the broader consequences of your actions?

Atlas is now famous. He will never not be famous. He’s so famous he has developed a celebrity-thin skin, which tends to happen: The more pretend power you get, the more your ego defenses become vulnerable to criticism. I wonder if there’s some lesson in that.

In one of his last television appearances, Atlas correctly noted that elderly Americans are suffering in isolation, and that government lockdowns can be harmful. Then he said that Americans should gather with their relatives for Thanksgiving because “for many people it might be their final Thanksgiving, believe it or not.”

I could try to spell out the illogic and cruelty in this statement. Or I could simply ask you to imagine a healthy grandmother who contracts Covid-19 because her family listened to Atlas’s advice, then suffers a lonely and painful deterioration in December and dies before Christmas. And then, two weeks later, your grandmother’s best friend, who didn’t get visitors during Thanksgiving, gets the first shot of a vaccine.",MSNBC,"['turned', 'suffering', 'virus', 'testing', 'famous', 'owning', 'atlas', 'thanksgiving', 'resist', 'paid', 'scott', 'price', 'americans', 'libs', 'scientists', 'public', 'cared', 'covid']",0

2020-12-03 13:41:25+00:00,32,"The number of claimants for initial weekly jobless benefits fell last week to 712,000, as the labor market struggles to rebuild itself amid a continued surge in Covid-19 infections that has led to a new round of restrictive measures.

The data, released Thursday by the Department of Labor, beat economists' expectations of 780,000 claims. In the prior week, total claims had ticked up sharply to a newly revised 787,000.

While claims remain well below the pandemic peak of 7 million in March, the weekly totals continue to represent three times the pre-pandemic average, and have never dipped below the Great Recession peak of 665,000.

In the wake of record rise in daily deaths from the virus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield issued a sober message on Wednesday, urging stricter adherence to safety precautions in order to slow the spread of the disease.

""I actually believe [the winter months] are going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation,” he said.

Millions of Americans disregarded advice from public health officials to stay home for Thanksgiving, choosing instead to travel to visit family.

The United States set three grim records on Wednesday, recording the highest number of daily deaths, new infections and hospitalizations since the pandemic began.

The worsening public health outlook comes as millions of unemployed Americans are set to lose their benefits at the end of the year as emergency federal assistance expires.

Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for Treasury secretary, described the situation Tuesday as ""an American tragedy.""

If the emergency pandemic programs were to be reinstated, the economy ""would be boosted by 3.5 percent, and 5.1 million more jobs would be added in 2021,"" said Economic Policy Institute Senior Economist Elise Gould and Director of Research Josh Bivens, in a report released Wednesday.

""If the effective safety net functions provided by these programs were maintained through 2021, millions of workers would be better able to avoid economic catastrophe while out of work due to the pandemic,"" they concluded.

In the Federal Reserve's most recent ""Beige Book,"" which surveys economic conditions across the U.S., many businesses said they feared ""employment levels would fall over the winter before recovering further,"" due to the increase in infections.

""The sharp rise in Covid-19 cases has precipitated more school and plant closings and renewed fears of infection, which have further aggravated labor supply problems, including absenteeism and attrition. Providing for childcare and virtual schooling needs was widely cited as a significant and growing issue for the workforce, especially for women,"" according to the report, released Wednesday afternoon.

On Monday, the Government Accountability Office said the Department of Labor has been miscounting and underpaying people receiving unemployment benefits from emergency pandemic programs. Instead of providing compensation based on previous pay, some states have only been paying the basic minimum — which has likely led to additional and unnecessary economic hardship.

""Even with inaccuracy, the ballpark size of total initial claims underscores that Covid-19 continues to inflect deep economic pain,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""With record virus cases combined with few outdoor options for businesses because of winter, the pain will continue.""

Focus now turns to Friday's monthly employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the first jobs report since Biden won the White House. Economists predict the economy gained just 450,000 jobs in the last month, leaving at least 9.5 million positions yet to be recovered.",MSNBC,"['expectations', 'labor', 'public', 'claims', 'economic', 'pandemic', 'weekly', '712000', 'released', 'programs', 'jobless', 'million', 'winter', 'fall', 'report', 'beating']",0

Meanwhile, more people than ever are hospitalized. The Covid Tracking Project reported that 100,000 people were hospitalized across the country.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The country has tallied 14,007,908 cases and 274,311 deaths since the pandemic began, according to an NBC News tally.

Much of the United States has seen a rise in cases over the last month. In the last two weeks that surge has been most acute in New Mexico, where the percentage of new cases has risen by 109 percent; Arizona, at 90 percent; and California, 75 percent, according to NBC News data.

“Cases are rising, hospitalizations are increasing, deaths are increasing. We need to try to bend the curve, stop this exponential increase,” Dr. Henry Walke, the CDC’s Covid-19 incident manager, said during a briefing.

Health experts are bracing for a possible surge in travel-related cases following Thanksgiving. Cases stemming from the holiday are likely to be apparent about a week to 10 days later.

CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield had a dire prediction for the winter months. ""I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation,” he said.

Much like it did before Thanksgiving, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending people that cancel plans to travel for the December holidays.

But if you must, get coronavirus tests before and after, experts said.

The agency on Wednesday announced new, shorter quarantine guidelines after possible exposure to the coronavirus.

The agency's previous guidance had been to quarantine for 14 days, but it's now suggesting two alternatives.

The first is to end quarantine after 10 days if no symptoms are reported, Walke said. The second option is to end quarantine after seven days if an individual tests negative and also reports no symptoms.",MSNBC,"['nbc', 'covid19', 'deaths', 'coronavirus', 'daily', 'walke', 'days', 'cases', 'tops', 'hospitalizations', 'million', 'record', '14', 'reported', 'sets', 'quarantine', 'according']",0

2020-12-03 07:41:02+00:00,16,"Public health officials hope to vaccinate as many people as possible to turn the tide of the coronavirus pandemic once a vaccine becomes available — even those who have already recovered from Covid-19.

And while it isn't yet known how the immune systems of Covid-19 survivors respond to a vaccine — particularly among coronavirus ""long-haulers,"" whose symptoms linger weeks and months after their diagnoses — there is likely to be little risk in getting the shot.

""The general recommendation is to get the vaccine, even if you were previously infected,"" said Dr. David Thomas, a professor of medicine and director of the infectious diseases division at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""There are some nuanced questions that we don't have the answer to yet, but from what we know now, it's the right call to get the vaccine.""

Covid-19 reinfections are thought to be rare, but if natural antibody levels wane over time, it may be possible for a person to become infected more than once. Doctors and infectious disease experts agree that most people should get vaccinated, even if they may have natural protective immunity. In most survivors, a vaccine might even enhance immunity from the initial infections.

It's a precaution with some precedent. Healthy adults over age 50 are still advised to get the shingles vaccine even if they have had chickenpox or shingles before.

""I did it because I wanted the extra immunity to protect me against a shingles relapse later in life,"" Thomas said of his recent decision to get the shingles vaccine. ""Even though I had previously been infected and had a certain amount of immunity, I chose to get a vaccine nonetheless to double down on that and make me even safer.""

The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing data on two vaccine candidates, made by Pfizer and Moderna, and an independent advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Tuesday to approve recommendations for who should be first in line to get the shots. The recommendations will go to the CDC's director for official signoff. The planned rollout has enormous implications for how the country rebounds from the pandemic, but it also raises questions about how the nearly 14 million in the U.S. who have already had confirmed cases of Covid-19 will be affected.

The vaccine trials set up by Pfizer and Moderna included participants from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, but they didn't focus on people who were previously sick with Covid-19.

Those types of detailed considerations are part of the vaccine approval process, and Thomas said Pfizer and Moderna would be expected to provide data about a number of outstanding questions even after the FDA initially grants emergency use authorization.

""Typically after something is approved, the FDA will say we're giving you approval, but you have to do all these things in a certain time frame and answer all these questions by a certain date or you lose approval,"" Thomas said. ""Companies are then required to do all these things, but in the meantime, you don't hold everything up.""

Some of the stipulations are likely to include specific questions about administering vaccines to people who have had Covid-19, as well as all the accompanying safety data.

So far, there is no evidence that a vaccine would be unsafe for Covid-19 survivors, but more research is needed, said Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""There haven't been any serious adverse events that make me think this would be a major issue, but I think that analysis has to be done,"" she said. ""The first question is about safety, but then the second question is: Is there any added benefit?""

Although the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials didn't recruit volunteers who were symptomatic or were known to have been previously infected, it's believed that up to 10 percent of participants in the trials had had the virus, said Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's $18 billion initiative to support the development of coronavirus vaccines. Those people either were asymptomatic or had such mild symptoms that they went undetected, he said.

""What we know is the vaccines are safe in these populations,"" Slaoui said Wednesday at a news briefing about Operation Warp Speed. He added that more data are needed about how the vaccine works in people who had symptoms and were sick with Covid-19.

Another big unknown is how Covid-19 ""long-haulers"" may respond, said Michael Betts, an immunologist and professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.

It's not known how many people suffer from long-term symptoms from Covid-19, but a CDC study published in July found that 35 percent of adults who were symptomatic but were never sick enough to require hospitalization hadn't returned to their usual health up to three weeks after their diagnoses.

Part of the challenge of assessing how those patients could be affected by a vaccine is that much is still unknown about why their symptoms persist.

""We really do not understand why these individuals are suffering like this, so my concern comes from the fact that we don't know the reason for these long-haul situations,"" Betts said.

Thomas said that without a clear grasp of why symptoms linger in certain patients, it's difficult to know whether the immune response from a vaccine would be beneficial or detrimental.

""People who have chronic inflammatory conditions from Covid may fall into a category where you might not want all of a sudden to boost up the immune system,"" Thomas said. ""But it's possible that it might also make them better, too. That's how little we understand this.""

Betts said long-haulers may need to be evaluated individually so doctors can evaluate the potential risks and benefits. Those patients will also need to be closely monitored and evaluated over time, he said.

""This might be a special group with case-by-case judgments,"" Betts said. ""We don't really understand the long-haul situation, so trying to predict how a vaccine will perform here is difficult.""",MSNBC,"['moderna', 'covid19', 'symptoms', 'thomas', 'know', 'questions', 'shingles', 'recovered', 'vaccinated', 'previously', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'covid']",0
2020-12-03 06:21:02+00:00,92,"An Oregon doctor dismissed Covid-19 as a ""common cold"" in a recently surfaced video and said the staff members at his clinic have not worn masks during the coronavirus pandemic.

The doctor, Steven LaTulippe, made the comments Nov. 7 during a ""Stop the Steal"" rally in support of President Donald Trump to a group gathered outside the State Capitol in Salem.

""I want to expose what I call corona mania,"" LaTulippe says in a video shared on YouTube by the political group Multnomah County Republicans and first reported by NBC affiliate KGW of Portland.

""I want you to know that I never shut down during the entire Covid season. ... I hate to tell you this, I might scare you, but I and my staff, none of us once wore a mask in my clinic,"" he continued as the crowd cheered. ""And how many problems did we have in our clinic from that? Zero. Absolutely none.""

LaTulippe, who owns South View Medical Arts in Dallas, southwest of Portland, said he has treated nearly 80 Covid-19 patients. Before he took the microphone, he was introduced as a doctor who was going to talk about the ""myths of Covid.""

""We have been utterly duped, and I want you to know that this is insanity and the purpose was only to shut down the American people. This is a threat to your freedom, a threat to our Constitution. I petition all of you, take off the mask of shame,"" LaTulippe said.

""It is a mask that is just designed to control you and to shut you down,"" he said, calling the virus, which has killed more than 271,000 people in the United States, ""a common cold virus.""

The office of Dr. Steven LaTulippe, a family medicine doctor, at South View Medical Arts in Dallas, Ore. Google maps

In a phone interview Wednesday, LaTulippe doubled down on his anti-mask stance, saying he does not agree with requiring masks because he believes ""there's bad science behind it.""

""I have absolutely zero problems with infectivity, and I have completely successful treatments, so I ask, 'What is the problem?' Why would I be demonized if I know what I'm doing?"" he said.

""I have a very rigid virus and flu-season protocol at my clinic, and it has worked very well for me for years,"" he continued. ""I've never had any of my staff or myself get sick.""

In a Nov. 20 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said seven studies conducted in various settings ""confirmed the benefit of universal masking in community level analyses.""

""Each analysis demonstrated that, following directives from organizational and political leadership for universal masking, new infections fell significantly,"" the CDC said.

Although LaTulippe refuses to wear a mask, he said he does ask patients who believe they have Covid-19 or who are showing symptoms of the virus to wear them.

He sees them at the end of the day after all of his other patients leave and treats them in a back room that is disinfected before and after they leave.

""I'm very interested in sound medical practice, and I'm interested in good science,"" he said. ""And when science and medicine become perverted with corrupt politics, then I'm up for a fight, and that's what made me go to that rally and say what I said.""

His comments contradict an executive order Gov. Kate Brown enacted that requires health care professionals to wear face coverings at all times while in health care offices, with limited exceptions, according to KGW.

The CDC and the Federation of State Medical Boards have also said health care staff members should wear masks to help prevent the spread of the virus.

The Oregon Medical Board said it could not comment on specific cases, but it said in a statement Wednesday that noncompliance with executive orders and state guidelines may result in disciplinary action.

The board's website showed no actions against LaTulippe.

""Unprofessional conduct includes, but is not limited to, conduct that does or might endanger the health or safety of the public. This includes failure to comply with an Executive Order issued by the Governor or failure to comply with state agency guidance applicable to the time and location where the licensee practices medicine,"" the board said in its statement.",MSNBC,"['oregon', 'mask', 'virus', 'common', 'health', 'medical', 'pandemic', 'refuse', 'cold', 'wear', 'latulippe', 'masks', 'state', 'doctor', 'staff', 'covid', 'clinic']",0

2020-12-03 04:19:03+00:00,31,"PARIS — Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the president of France from 1974 to 1981 who became a champion of European integration, died on Wednesday. He was 94.

Giscard d’Estaing’s office said he passed away in his family home in the Loir-et-Cher region, in central France, after contracting COVID-19.

“In accordance with his wishes, his funeral will take place in strict privacy,” his office said.

Giscard d’Estaing was hospitalized last month with heart problems, but remained vigorous deep into old age.

In a January interview with The Associated Press, he displayed a firm handshake and sharp eye, recounting details from his meetings as French president in the 1970s with then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and then-Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat, whose photos graced his office walls.

He wrote the article in the EU charter that allowed Brexit to happen — the brief measure that allows a member state to leave the bloc.

On the eve of Britain’s departure this year, Giscard told AP it was a “step backward” geopolitically, but took the long view. “We functioned without Britain during the first years of the European Union ... So we will rediscover a situation that we have already known.”

Born in Germany in the wake of World War I, Giscard d’Estaing helped liberate Paris from the Nazis in the next world war, and later laid the groundwork for the shared euro currency and helped integrate Britain into what became the EU in the 1970s.

Seeing the Britons leave, “I feel great regret,” he said.

He remained unfailingly optimistic in the European project, forecasting that the EU and the euro would bounce back and gradually grow stronger and bigger despite the challenges of losing a major member.

When he took office in 1974, Giscard d’Estaing began as the model of a modern French president, a conservative with liberal views on social issues.

Abortion and divorce by mutual consent were legalized under his term, and he reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18.

He played his accordion in working-class neighborhoods. One Christmas morning, he invited four passing garbage men to breakfast at the presidential palace.

He lost his re-election bid in 1981 to Socialist Francois Mitterrand.

Born in 1926 in Coblenz, Germany, where his father was a financial director of the post-World War I French occupation administration, he grew up with a pan-European view. After joining the French Resistance during World War II, he next saw Germany as a tank commander in the French military in 1944.

In 1952, he married Anne-AymoneIt de Brantes, the daughter of a count and heiress to a steel fortune. They had four children: Valerie-Anne, Louis, Henri and Jacinte.

Young Giscard d’Estaing studied at the prestigious Polytechnical Institute and then the elite National School of Administration, before mastering economics at Oxford.

President Charles de Gaulle named him finance minister at the age of 36.

After his defeat in the 1981 presidential election, he temporarily retired from politics.

He then found a second calling in the European Union. He worked on writing a European Constitution which was formally presented in 2004, but rejected by French and Dutch voters. However, it paved the way for the adoption of the Treaty on European Union in 2007.

At age 83, he published a romance novel called “The Princess and the President,” which he said was based on Princess Diana, with whom he said he discussed writing a love story.

Asked about the nature of their relationship, he said only: “Let us not exaggerate. I knew her a bit in a climate of a confidential relationship. She needed to communicate.”

Earlier this year, a German journalist accused Giscard of repeatedly grabbing her during an interview, and filed a sexual assault complaint with Paris prosecutors. Giscard’s French lawyer said the 94-year-old former president “retains no memory” of the incident.

Former French President Francois Hollande paid tribute to “a stateman who had chosen to open up to the world and was thinking that Europe was a condition for France to be greater.”

Hollande’s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, expressed his “deep sadness.” Giscard d’Estaing “made France be proud,” he said.",MSNBC,"['giscard', 'destaing', 'world', 'dies', 'president', 'office', 'contracting', 'paris', 'french', '94', 'war', 'european', 'france', 'valéry', 'covid']",0

The couple, Wesley Moribe and Courtney Peterson, knew they had tested positive when they boarded a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Lihue, Coco Zickos, a spokeswoman for Kauai police, said Wednesday.

They had taken Covid-19 tests in Seattle before their flight to San Francisco, as part of Hawaii's Safe Travels program, Zickos said.

The tests returned positive, but the couple was already en route to San Francisco, where they had a layover, she said. The couple was notified of their test results before boarding the flight to Hawaii and instructed to isolate and not travel. It is not clear who told the couple about their positive status. Zickos initially said the couple was informed by San Francisco International Airport officials, but a spokesman for the airport said its quarantine station did not interact with the couple.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified authorities in Lihue after Moribe and Peterson continued on their planned flight, Zickos said.

When Moribe and Peterson arrived at Lihue Airport, they were met by officials from the Department of Health and escorted by police to an isolation room for further processing and investigation.

Moribe, 41, and Peterson, 46, residents of Wailua, were arrested on second-degree reckless endangerment charges. A family member took their son home, and Child Protective Services was notified, Zickos said.

""They knowingly boarded a flight aware of their positive COVID-19 test results, placing the passengers of the flight in danger of death,"" Zickos said in a statement.

A spokesman for the Hawaii Covid-19 Joint Information Center said Wednesday that the state Health Department is alerted when someone tests positive and that the couple were aware of their diagnosis before they boarded the flight in San Francisco.

""Rather than quarantining and contacting their health provider, they went on the plane,"" the spokesman said.

There were 17,968 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Hawaii as of Sunday, with 244 deaths, according to state health data.

The couple posted bail, which was set at $1,000. They could face up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine if convicted. They did not immediately return requests for comment.

Passengers who test positive for coronavirus are not permitted to fly.

""Following CDC guidelines, you will not be able to travel on United for at least 10 days after the date you tested positive and only after you have two successive negative COVID-19 results that were administered at least 24 hours apart,"" the airline's website says.

""Prior to traveling, all United customers are required to complete a 'Ready to Fly' checklist acknowledging they have not been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 14 days,"" the spokesperson said.

2020-12-02 20:39:09+00:00,71,"WASHINGTON — Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the top Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate, will support using the pared-back $908 billion Covid-19 aid package crafted by a group of bipartisan lawmakers as the basis for a final deal.

Their support renews hope that Congress could approve aid before the end of the year. The proposal would provide an extra $300 a week in unemployment payments and extend help to cash-strapped local governments, as well as provide support for small businesses, transit systems and airlines.

The Democrats urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to consider the proposal, a concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who had been pushing for a package more than twice as large.

In a joint statement, Pelosi of California, the House speaker, and Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, said: ""While we made a new offer to Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy on Monday, in the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.""

(Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is the House minority leader.)

The Democrats' support puts pressure on McConnell to return to the negotiating table in earnest, as lawmakers from both parties are eager to pass some sort of relief before they head home from Washington for the holidays — leaving just days for the lame-duck Congress to come to an agreement.

So far, McConnell has indicated that he prefers to keep coronavirus spending closer to the GOP's earlier proposal of $550 billion, and he has said he plans to attach any Covid-19 agreement to a government funding bill before the Dec. 11 deadline to avoid a shutdown.

""Given the challenges of moving things across the Senate floor speedily, that would be a vehicle to add on whatever coronavirus relief bill we know will get a presidential signature,"" McConnell told reporters. ""Obviously, as was discussed earlier, you have to have Democratic votes to get through the House. I think it will all likely come in one package.""

The bipartisan plan introduced Tuesday was supported by a number of moderate senators, including Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Bill Cassidy, R-La.

The proposal includes liability protections for businesses that remain open during the pandemic, a provision that has been a nonstarter for Pelosi and Schumer in the past.

The package excludes another round of the $1,200 direct payments that were sent out under the CARES Act, which was passed in March.

Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., told reporters Wednesday that he thought the bipartisan plan could gain support from Senate Republicans, but he said: ""We're also looking at Senator McConnell's [plan]. So we're kind for working through to see where the support is. And then you've got to remember we have to be talking to the administration to make sure it's something that they'll support, as well as the House.""

Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said the statement from Pelosi and Schumer represented ""progress,"" but he also indicated that the party was not ready to abandon McConnell's proposal.

""At some point, hopefully, we'll be able to find the common ground and maybe we can merge"" the plans, he said.

While White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that stimulus relief was a ""policy priority"" for the administration, it is unclear what President Donald Trump will be willing to support in the final few weeks of his term. McConnell said Tuesday that he was working with the White House to see what Trump will sign.

Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.Y., and Tom Reed, R-N.Y., who helped craft the plan, thanked Pelosi and Schumer, calling their support ""a much-needed step in the right direction.""

""We thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer for recognizing the critical need for a bipartisan, bicameral emergency COVID-19 relief package,"" they said.

2020-12-02 07:43:17+00:00,80,"LONDON — The United Kingdom became the first country Wednesday to formally approve the Pfizer and BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, a symbolic milestone in the fight against the pandemic.

The first inoculations are set to be rolled out next week, the government said. The initial batch of 800,000 will cover a relatively small number of health care workers, care home staff and residents, and people over age 80.

The vaccine has been authorized far more quickly than any other in history, its lightning development outpacing the 15 to 20 years it usually takes to develop these types of medicines.

Politically it will not go unnoticed that British regulators have made this decision ahead of their American counterparts, a symptom of different officials and businesses around the world trying to strike the right balance among speed, safety and effectiveness.

President Donald Trump has accused the Food and Drug Administration of dragging its feet, while the FDA says it's simply taking the time to make the right call. FDA regulators are set to discuss the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine next week, by which time it will already be available across the U.K., the British government said Wednesday.

""It's fantastic,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""

Help is on its way.



The MHRA has formally authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19.



The NHS stands ready to start vaccinating early next week.



The UK is the first country in the world to have a clinically approved vaccine for supply. — Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) December 2, 2020

Nearly 1.5 million people around the world have died from the virus, with more than 271,000 deaths in the U.S. and nearly 60,000 in the U.K.

The U.K. has one of the highest Covid-19 deaths rates per capita in the world, behind only those of Italy, Spain, Peru and Belgium, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The vaccine by Pfizer, a U.S. pharmaceutical giant, and its German partner, BioNTech, is one of three front-runners that have delivered promising results in recent weeks. Clinical trials found that it was 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, it said.

""This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a news release following the British decision.

But even for a wealthy country like the U.K., rolling out the vaccine won't be easy.

The U.K. has ordered 40 million doses — enough for up to a third of the population, given that it is a two-shot regimen. None have been delivered yet, and most won't come until next year.

When the first batch arrives from Pfizer's plant in Belgium, it will contain around 800,000 doses, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC.

By the end of the year, the supply is likely to ramp up into the ""millions,"" Hancock said, deliberately declining to give a specific figure because it will be ""determined by how quickly Pfizer can manufacture in Belgium.""

Every time a new batch is sent over, it will have to be tested again by the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA.

The shots must be kept at minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit, requiring specialist dry-ice freezers that many doctors' offices and even hospitals don't have. Pfizer-BioNTech says the vaccine can be kept for its final five days at regular refrigerator temperature.

And its rapid development cuts both ways: If there are Americans who will look enviously at vaccinated Brits, then there are also those in the U.K. who have questioned the safety of the shots given how quickly they were produced.

Meanwhile, anti-vaccine activism is rising internationally, with a quarter of people saying they would shun any vaccine approved by regulators, according to an Ipsos poll of 18,000 people in 27 countries in August.

Independent experts say the vaccine skepticism is unfounded. The timeline for the coronavirus vaccines has been slashed because companies and regulators closely collaborated to overlap different stages of the usually arduous and bureaucratic process.

""Our expert scientists and clinicians have worked round the clock, carefully, methodically poring over tables, analyses and graphs on over a thousand pages of data,"" Dr. June Raine, CEO of the MHRA, said at a news conference. ""That doesn't mean that any corners have been cut — none at all.""

In the U.S., both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have submitted applications to the FDA for emergency use authorizations. The FDA is expected to meet to discuss the vaccine candidates next week and the week afterward, respectively.

BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin told NBC News' Richard Engel that he was ""confident that an authorization in the U.S. could also happen within the next two weeks.""

The European Union will wait longer. Its regulator announced Tuesday that it wouldn't decide on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine until as late as Dec. 29 and Moderna's by Jan. 12.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization told Reuters that it had received data from the companies and was reviewing them for ""possible listing for emergency use"" — meaning the vaccines could be rolled out more quickly in developing countries.",MSNBC,"['approve', 'world', 'covid19', 'pfizerbiontech', 'regulators', 'vaccines', 'country', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'quickly', 'fda', 'week', 'uk']",0

2020-12-02 03:46:06+00:00,27,"Health care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities will be the first groups to be offered the Covid-19 vaccine, according to a new proposal from an independent advisory committee within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met virtually on Tuesday to discuss who would receive the first doses of the vaccine and to vote on the proposed language for the recommendation. The proposal passed 13 to 1.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The panel of outside scientific experts makes recommendations to the CDC, which almost always accepts them.

“We have spent eight months discussing and evaluating the data,” Dr. José Romero, ACIP chair, said following the vote. “We are using the principles of maximizing benefits and minimizing harms, promoting justice and mitigating health inequities.”

The first phase of the vaccine rollout will be known as Phase 1a and is set to begin as soon as a vaccine receives authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which is currently reviewing data on two vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna. The FDA’s advisory committee will meet on Dec. 10 to consider an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine.

Current estimates project that no more than 20 million doses of each vaccine will be available by the end of the year. And each product requires two doses.

As a result, the shots will be rationed in the early stages. Experts say the vaccine will probably not become widely available in the U.S. until the spring.

The two groups in Phase 1a together represent around 24 million Americans — 21 million health care workers and 3 million residents of long-term care facilities. Staff working at long-term care facilities are considered among the health care workers.

As the meeting got underway, panel member Dr. Beth Bell of the University of Washington noted that on average, one person is dying of COVID-19 per minute in the U.S. right now, “so I guess we are acting none too soon.”

During the discussion period, panel members asked about how the vaccine doses would be prioritized within the groups in Phase 1a. For example, health care workers with direct patient contact would be among the first to be offered the vaccine, as well as individuals working in long-term care facilities.

Other questions addressed vaccine safety and adverse events monitoring after people received the vaccine.

“We're going to hold ourselves to an exceedingly high standard for safety monitoring after a vaccine is authorized and when it's rolled out more broadly,” said Dr. Nancy Messioner, the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC.

Safety monitoring will include several components, including the long-running Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, managed by both the CDC and FDA, and a new approach called V-SAFE, which monitors early recipients of the Covid-19 vaccine with text messages and online surveys.

The one “no” vote came from Dr. Helen Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University. After the vote, Talbot said that she supported giving the vaccine to health care workers, but had concerns about frail, older residents of long-term care facilities receiving the shot and whether the vaccines would work as well for them.

“I do not feel like our safety network for long-term care facilities is strong enough yet,” Talbot said. “I think there's some work that needs to be done.”

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who is not on the panel, said the recommendation was an excellent decision.

“Long journeys begin with first steps,” he said. “And this was a firm, clear first step that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be the first in the line to get the vaccine.”

Schaffner acknowledged the concern about giving the vaccine to nursing home residents. “Will the vaccine be as effective in that group? We’ll just have to find out.”

“There’s no right decision here, there’s no wrong decision here,” he added.

The advisory panel will meet again in several weeks to decide who should be next in line.

Among the possibilities: teachers, police officers, firefighters and workers in other essential fields such as food production and transportation; the elderly; and people with underlying medical conditions.

2020-12-01 21:17:06+00:00,110,"Rebellious GOP lawmakers in Ohio are seeking to impeach Gov. Mike DeWine, a fellow Republican, saying he violated state and federal laws by mandating the wearing of masks and ordering businesses to close to slow the spread of Covid-19.

Charging that DeWine has “assumed dictatorial powers,” state Rep. John Becker on Tuesday accused the governor of “putting nearly 12 million people under house arrest.”

“We can debate whether these moves have been effective at stopping the spread of the virus. I don’t know if they have,” Becker told NBC News. “What I do know is, he’s done it outside the law.”

DeWine, who defied President Donald Trump by imposing sweeping restrictions early on in the pandemic that succeeded for a time in flattening the coronavirus curve, dismissed the renewed effort to oust him, after a similar move over the summer failed.

“I guess they have a right to go and file anything they want to, but you know, we're going to stay focused on what we have to,” DeWine said Tuesday in a CBS News interview.

The lawmakers, DeWine said, “want to criticize measures like wearing mask and basic things that we know — absolutely know — work.”

“You know, they should go talk to those front-line health people because I think when they listen to them, it's pretty clear, we have to do whatever we can to slow this virus down,” DeWine said.

DeWine reimposed a statewide mask mandate and other restrictions following the presidential election last month after the number of new Covid-19 cases skyrocketed in Ohio.

Becker, along with state Reps. Candice Keller, Nino Vitale and Paul Zeltwanger, filed a dozen articles of impeachment on Monday. Among other things, they accused DeWine of “weaponizing” the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation to “bully and harass businesses and the people” into wearing masks in public.

“Rather than hearing the cries of Ohioans, Gov. DeWine continues to stifle those cries by finding more inventive ways to use masks to muffle the voices of the people,” Becker said in his statement.

Christopher Devine, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Dayton and an expert on Ohio politics, said, “This is not a serious attempt to impeach Gov. DeWine.”

“It will almost certainly fail, as did a similar effort by some of the same lawmakers in August,” he said. “The four lawmakers leading this effort are fringe members of the Ohio Legislature who have little credibility with their colleagues and seem more focused on attracting attention on social media than making any constructive contribution to the pandemic response.”

Still, Devine said, this points to DeWine’s “vulnerability among more extreme members of the Republican Party's base as he seeks renomination and re-election in 2022.”

Early on in the pandemic, DeWine garnered bipartisan praise for taking swift action to contain the coronavirus crisis. He declared a state of emergency in March to postpone the presidential primary and was among the first governors to require people visiting nursing homes or prisons to undergo health screenings.

DeWine also resisted calls from Trump to quickly reopen the state economy and lift the stay-at-home orders. But those moves drew the ire of Trump’s most ardent Republican supporters who demonized DeWine and Dr. Amy Acton, the governor’s then-director of the state Department of Health.

While DeWine defended Acton, she resigned in June after the Republican-led Legislature moved to curb her powers. Not long after that, Ohio’s coronavirus numbers started climbing rapidly again.

As of Tuesday, Ohio had reported 421,063 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 6,429 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest NBC News data. And most of the cases and fatalities were reported after DeWine began loosening the restrictions over the summer.

In August, Becker, Vitale and Zeltwanger drew up 10 articles of impeachment against DeWine. But it never got to a vote after both Republicans and Democrats objected.

The move by Becker, Vitale and Zeltwanger, Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken said, is “a baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.”

Ohio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper noted that the Republican hard-liners want to oust DeWine but did not expel Rep. Larry Householder from the state Legislature after he was hit with corruption charges, although they did remove him as House speaker.

“The Ohio GOP’s message to voters is clear — corruption and bribery are A-OK with us, but having the audacity to listen to public health experts during a global pandemic is an impeachable offense,” he said.",MSNBC,"['republican', 'impeachment', 'wearing', 'know', 'gov', 'restrictions', 'faces', 'dewine', 'becker', 'ohio', 'pandemic', 'lawmakers', 'state', 'zeltwanger', 'rebels', 'covid', 'gop']",0

President Donald Trump first saw Atlas, who is a senior fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution, on Fox News. Once ensconced in the White House as an official coronavirus adviser, Atlas was more than happy to gloss over Trump’s Covid-19 hunches with a goo of science-y language and “own the libs” dudgeon.

Atlas had his own hunches, some of which turned out to be sound (he was a strong advocate for keeping schools open), some of which turned out to be dangerous (in the face of mounting evidence that masks work, he insisted the opposite), and some of which turned out to be disastrous (he believed that increased testing misallocated resources, that college students should be left to their own devices, and that the president should both resist bureaucratic efforts to expand testing in the fall and encourage efforts to resist state lockdowns as cases rose).

In reality, a lack of testing hobbled state efforts to curtail a predictable rise in cases as college students going back and forth between home and school spread the virus, largely because many people who spread the virus don’t show symptoms. Herd immunity, a controversial Covid-19 containment strategy that Atlas pushed early on, is clearly not something this diagnostic radiologist understands. It turns out that the virus is orders of magnitude deadlier than Atlas first thought, and that Americans do not want the virus to tear through communities unchecked until we get vaccinated.

Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

But Atlas’ many mistakes are not the problem — not exactly. Scientists get things wrong, and plenty have made mistakes during this pandemic. But the difference between Scott Atlas and most scientists is that most scientists adjust their beliefs to fit the evidence, whereas Atlas simply dug in.

2020-12-01 17:43:05+00:00,52,"As of Monday, radiologist Scott W. Atlas is no longer deranging the federal government’s pandemic response, and we will all be the better for it.

President Donald Trump first saw Atlas, who is a senior fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution, on Fox News. Once ensconced in the White House as an official coronavirus adviser, Atlas was more than happy to gloss over Trump’s Covid-19 hunches with a goo of science-y language and “own the libs” dudgeon.

Atlas had his own hunches, some of which turned out to be sound (he was a strong advocate for keeping schools open), some of which turned out to be dangerous (in the face of mounting evidence that masks work, he insisted the opposite), and some of which turned out to be disastrous (he believed that increased testing misallocated resources, that college students should be left to their own devices, and that the president should both resist bureaucratic efforts to expand testing in the fall and encourage efforts to resist state lockdowns as cases rose).

In reality, a lack of testing hobbled state efforts to curtail a predictable rise in cases as college students going back and forth between home and school spread the virus, largely because many people who spread the virus don’t show symptoms. Herd immunity, a controversial Covid-19 containment strategy that Atlas pushed early on, is clearly not something this diagnostic radiologist understands. It turns out that the virus is orders of magnitude deadlier than Atlas first thought, and that Americans do not want the virus to tear through communities unchecked until we get vaccinated.

Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

But Atlas’ many mistakes are not the problem — not exactly. Scientists get things wrong, and plenty have made mistakes during this pandemic. But the difference between Scott Atlas and most scientists is that most scientists adjust their beliefs to fit the evidence, whereas Atlas simply dug in.

A scientist should approach public communication humbly, as a privilege. Atlas approached it as an exercise in partisanship. Scientists are already facing an uphill battle because the public is often persuaded by loud, repetitive, certainty-hardened voices. Outside of government, Atlas would be a crank. Inside government, he drove policy decisions that contributed to suffering and death.

Technically, he was appointed a “special government employee,” which administrations past have used to bring unique experts into government service during emergencies. The day he was named to the coronavirus task force, Trump called him “a very famous man who’s also very highly respected.” (He was marginally respected by a specific conservative clique and only Fox News-famous.)

A scientist should approach public communication humbly, as a privilege. Atlas approached it as an exercise in partisanship.

I can’t see into Atlas’s brain, but I can run an experiment on myself. If I was asked to serve on the coronavirus task force, a position to which I would bring no unique perspective or expertise, what would I do? I can fake it as well as anyone, and yeah, I’d be close to the seat of power. Power and influence are seductive, as is the chance to help influence the course of history and to know stuff before other people do. A job like that would most likely make me feel, in the moment, like I was famous and highly respected.

2020-12-01 09:03:02+00:00,29,"With multiple Covid-19 vaccines rapidly heading toward approval, optometrists and dentists are pushing for the authority to immunize patients during routine eye exams and dental cleanings.

These medical professionals say their help will be needed to distribute the vaccines to millions of Americans — and they already have the know-how.

""When you look at what dentists do and how many injections they give day in and day out, I think they're more than qualified,"" said dentist Jim Wood, a California state Assembly member. ""It's kind of a no-brainer.""

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

In California, the professional organizations representing dentists and optometrists are in talks with state officials to expand their job descriptions to include administering vaccines. Oregon has already begun training and certifying dentists to give vaccines. And at least half the states have considered allowing dentists to administer Covid-19 vaccines once they're available, according to the American Association of Dental Boards.

That list is likely to grow, because the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recommended in October that states consider expanding their list of vaccine providers.

The dentists and optometrists argue that their help would take some of the pressure off hospitals and doctors' offices. It could also bring some extra money into their practices.

""Everyone in our specialized health care system should also play a preventive role,"" said Dr. William Sage, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Texas at Austin. ""Pandemic or not, being alert to preventive health in any setting is a good thing.""

But it's too early to know how those professionals could factor into the Covid-19 vaccination effort, in part because the distribution strategy is still being worked out and because it's unclear which vaccines will be administered.

Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca announced this month that their Covid-19 vaccine candidates delivered promising results in clinical trials and that millions of doses could be ready before the end of the year. Pfizer's has to be stored at ultracold temperatures, while Moderna's and AstraZeneca's can be kept at standard refrigerator temperatures.

It wouldn't be the first time health professionals other than doctors have administered vaccines during a pandemic. Nursing students, EMTs and midwives in a handful of states were granted temporary, limited authority to administer flu vaccines during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009-10. Dentists in Massachusetts, Illinois, New York and Minnesota were also temporarily deputized as vaccinators.

Since then, Minnesota and Illinois have adopted laws to allow dentists to give flu shots to adults. And last year, Oregon became the first state to allow dentists to give any vaccine to any patient, child or adult.

So far, more than 200 dentists and dental students in Oregon have completed the training course offered by the Oregon Health & Science University's School of Dentistry, with 60 others expected to finish by the end of December, said Mary Pat Califano, an instructor who helped develop the hands-on part of the training.

Students spend around 10 hours in online classes. They then undergo hands-on training, during which they practice injections on shoulder pads before practicing injecting partners with saline solution. They're taught how to counsel patients about vaccines and avoid injuring patients' shoulders.

Once dentists pass an exam, they can register with the Oregon Health Authority and begin getting their staff members trained to handle vaccines and procuring refrigerators to store them in.

The goal, Califano said, isn't to replace family doctors or primary care physicians but to supplement them. The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2017, 31.1 million Americans saw dentists but not physicians.

""We just need as many people as possible to give flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines when they're available,"" Califano said. ""If it happens that they're in a dental office and that provider is educated and capable of giving a vaccine, why not?""

The California Dental Association is exploring options for gaining vaccine authority, which would be likely to require the Legislature to step in. California passed a law this year allowing pharmacists to administer Covid-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Wood, who introduced the measure, hasn't yet committed to sponsoring a bill that would let dentists give vaccines, but he said he supports the idea.

""We give injections in the mouth all day long, and these are very precise kinds of injections,"" Wood said. ""I think the learning curve for a dentist would be small.""

Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University, said proposals to expand the vaccine workforce are promising. Flu vaccines, which are relatively low-risk and simple to administer, would be the perfect candidate to stock in dental and optometric fridges to start.

But Schaffner said he doesn't believe dentists and optometrists will play a major role in the Covid-19 immunization effort. It would take too long to pass legislation to expand the scope of practice for every professional who wants it in every state, he said. And because some Covid-19 vaccines have specific shipping and subzero storing requirements, they will probably be distributed only to specially trained personnel at a small number of locations, he said.

There's also the question of payment. It's hard — but not impossible — to make a profit administering vaccines, Schaffner said.

Providers have to decide each season how many doses to buy, and any that go bad or remain in the fridge at the end of their shelf life equal monetary losses.

""Unless you're very assiduous about moving the vaccine from the fridge into arms, you're not going to make money,"" Schaffner said. ""People who do that can augment their income, but nobody is going to drive a Porsche because of vaccines.""

Jeff McCombs, an associate professor of health economics at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, agreed that it might not make business sense for most dentists to start vaccinating. He said it would be hard to keep well-stocked vaccine fridges with enough variety to meet patients' needs without wasting doses. Generally, adults who choose not to get vaccinated do so because they're uneducated about vaccines or they're afraid, he said, not because they can't access them.

""I don't think it's going to harm people,"" McCombs said. ""I just don't think they'll make any money at it.""

While the California Department of Public Health said the state's vaccine infrastructure is sufficient for flu shots and routine immunizations, it is ""carefully considering the need to include additional types of immunizers"" to get Californians vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a statement from the department.

The California Optometric Association said it is in talks with Gov. Gavin Newsom's vaccine task force about how to get optometrists into the mix, and is exploring legislative options as well.

""We can serve the dual role of assisting with vision needs and protecting from Covid,"" said David Ardaya, an optometrist in Whittier who chairs an association committee that is looking into the issue. ""Our whole hope is to assist our nation in regaining its health and in returning to a sense of normal.""

A 2017 state law technically allows optometrists who have undergone a certification program to give adults flu, shingles and pneumococcal vaccines.

But three years after AB-443 was signed, the regulations implementing it have yet to be finalized.

That didn't stop Frank Giardina, an optometrist in Nipomo, from going through a certification program anyway.

The 20-hour course, which includes online lectures, hands-on lessons and an exam, is the same course pharmacists take when they're learning how to give all vaccines to people of all ages.

Giardina pointed to the shingles, or herpes zoster, virus as an example of why optometrists are well suited to give vaccines. The virus can infect the eyes, and even though he's allowed to treat shingles, he can't give a vaccine to prevent it.

For now, he's holding out hope that he will get permission to administer vaccines, including those for Covid-19. He envisions a world in which patients come in for contact lenses and he can offer them flu or Covid-19 vaccines while they're there.

""We're another member of the health care team. It's a waste of manpower not to,"" Giardina said. ""If you're trying to vaccinate all these people, especially in rural areas, you need whoever you can find.""

I did not have Covid-19; rather, I had rushed from the NBC News studio at 30 Rock straight to the ER because I was afraid I was having a heart attack.

First of all, I’m fine. I had a few more days of the small palpitations that had been bothering me — noticeable but never painful, reminding me that my body was working harder than it should. The slight, breathy feeling — almost like a thin vapor in my lungs — is also gone.

More than 1 million Americans flew this Thanksgiving — fewer than we would have had without the coronavirus, but the most recorded by the TSA since March. This happened despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioning people to stay home, and despite fast-rising numbers of new cases across the country.

I took that trip to the hospital when I feared the worst. And believe me: a hospital is not where you want to be right now.

But planning holiday travel is not the trip you should be thinking about. It’s the trip to the hospital following a potential Covid-19 diagnosis. Hospitals around the country are now bracing for a surge in cases that will hit ERs and ICUs once infections contracted during Thanksgiving travel have had time to incubate.

I took that trip to the hospital when I feared it the worst. And believe me: A hospital is not where you want to be right now. One nurse had to wheel me from the ER to another room, just to have enough space to physically put in an IV line. It was the “resuscitation room,” a space for reviving people who cannot breathe. It looked eerily like a coroner’s lab: stainless steel paneling and stretchers with crisp, white sheets.

Cities are reopening makeshift field hospitals where they had to treat the overflow of patients in March. Many are reinstating lockdowns and limiting visitors to hospitals and medical centers again.

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow recently shared that her longtime partner was battling Covid-19, a battle that at one point looked like she would lose. Maddow endured the torment that millions of families have had to endure: trying to help keep a loved one alive, from a safe distance. We should all be so lucky to be loved so unabashedly, so — this is Maddow’s word — desperately, as she described her love for her partner of 21 years. Maddow tested negative, but remained in quarantine for the suggested two weeks.

As I said before, I’m fine. Tests run in the ER the day of my hospital visit showed no signs of heart damage, and no indications of a heart attack. By the time I left, my blood pressure reading was better than normal. I won’t need surgery or a stent or anything like that. In fact, one of the main things I have to be more diligent about is drinking water. My heart was working extra-hard partly because my blood was getting too thick. Just over half of your blood is plasma, and nearly all of that plasma is water.

This is a rough time to be in a hospital, medically or emotionally. The day I went to the ER, I put off calling my mother until I knew that I was being admitted to a regular hospital room. I was afraid of making her panic with the thought that I was just in limbo. The idea of forcing my mom to put the need to keep herself safe from Covid-19 over her need to see me through an emergency in person — I could not bear that.

Let me tell you something: Someone loves you, desperately, and they would be destroyed if anything happened to you. Especially something that left them feeling as helpless as Covid-19 has made so many of us feel.

Why would you choose to not protect yourself, and potentially destroy someone who loves you? That’s a question I found myself asking when seeing reports of the wave of holiday travelers. Many of us are suffering from the isolation of this deadly pandemic. Some are letting that longing to gather with family and hug their loved ones override the practical actions that will literally save lives.

This year, my family showed our love for one another by not gathering for Thanksgiving dinner. It was hard, but it would have been much harder knowing we had endangered the people we love. So I ask you, who is your reason for fighting Covid-19? And how are you keeping them safe as we enter this holiday season?

I had to go to the ER. If you don’t, why would you choose to? You are someone’s reason for being, the center of someone’s universe, the one and only person they would die for.

In fact, one of the main things I have to be more diligent about is drinking water. My heart was working extra-hard partly because my blood was getting too thick. Just over half of your blood is plasma, and nearly all of that plasma is water.

This is a rough time to be in a hospital, medically or emotionally. The day I went to the ER, I put off calling my mother until I knew that I was being admitted to a regular hospital room. I was afraid of making her panic with the thought that I was just in limbo. The idea of forcing my mom to put the need to keep herself safe from Covid-19 over her need to see me through an emergency in person — I could not bear that.

Let me tell you something: Someone loves you, desperately, and they would be destroyed if anything happened to you. Especially something that left them feeling as helpless as Covid-19 has made so many of us feel.

Why would you choose to not protect yourself, and potentially destroy someone who loves you? That’s a question I found myself asking when seeing reports of the wave of holiday travelers. Many of us are suffering from the isolation of this deadly pandemic. Some are letting that longing to gather with family and hug their loved ones override the practical actions that will literally save lives.

Why would you choose to not protect yourself, and potentially destroy someone who loves you?

This year, my family showed our love for one another by not gathering for Thanksgiving dinner. It was hard, but it would have been much harder knowing we had endangered the people we love. So I ask you, who is your reason for fighting Covid-19? And how are you keeping them safe as we enter this holiday season?

I had to go to the ER. If you don’t, why would you choose to? You are someone’s reason for being, the center of someone’s universe, the one and only person they would die for. You are precious to someone, and that someone would shatter in a million irreparable pieces if you didn't do everything you could to protect yourself from Covid-19.

2020-12-01 00:33:06+00:00,23,"On Nov. 20, I was anchoring NBC News Now from noon to 2 p.m. By 3 p.m., I was in an emergency room describing symptoms of chest pressure, slight shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure and a pulse that rose much too high with even slight exertion. I did not have Covid-19; rather, I had rushed from the NBC News studio at 30 Rock straight to the ER because I was afraid I was having a heart attack.

First of all, I’m fine. I had a few more days of the small palpitations that had been bothering me — noticeable but never painful, reminding me that my body was working harder than it should. The slight, breathy feeling — almost like a thin vapor in my lungs — is also gone.

More than 1 million Americans flew this Thanksgiving — fewer than we would have had without the coronavirus, but the most recorded by the TSA since March. This happened despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioning people to stay home, and despite fast-rising numbers of new cases across the country.

I took that trip to the hospital when I feared the worst. And believe me: a hospital is not where you want to be right now.

But planning holiday travel is not the trip you should be thinking about. It’s the trip to the hospital following a potential Covid-19 diagnosis. Hospitals around the country are now bracing for a surge in cases that will hit ERs and ICUs once infections contracted during Thanksgiving travel have had time to incubate.

I took that trip to the hospital when I feared it the worst. And believe me: A hospital is not where you want to be right now. One nurse had to wheel me from the ER to another room, just to have enough space to physically put in an IV line. It was the “resuscitation room,” a space for reviving people who cannot breathe. It looked eerily like a coroner’s lab: stainless steel paneling and stretchers with crisp, white sheets.

Cities are reopening makeshift field hospitals where they had to treat the overflow of patients in March. Many are reinstating lockdowns and limiting visitors to hospitals and medical centers again.

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow recently shared that her longtime partner was battling Covid-19, a battle that at one point looked like she would lose. Maddow endured the torment that millions of families have had to endure: trying to help keep a loved one alive, from a safe distance. We should all be so lucky to be loved so unabashedly, so — this is Maddow’s word — desperately, as she described her love for her partner of 21 years. Maddow tested negative, but remained in quarantine for the suggested two weeks.

2020-12-01 00:03:07+00:00,28,"Vaccination proponents and misinformation researchers had been waiting for years for Facebook to take action against the biggest and most influential anti-vaccination pages.

So it was with some trepidation that they welcomed the news that the social network last week had banned some of the most popular and prolific anti-vaccination accounts — pages that had also pushed Covid-19 vaccination misinformation to millions of people.

Their impact, however, lives on. While researchers of extremism and public health advocates see the removal of the largest anti-vaccination accounts as mostly positive, new research shows the bigger threat to public trust in a Covid-19 vaccine comes from smaller, better-connected Facebook groups that gravitated to anti-vaccination messaging in recent months.

“What we’re seeing play out with Covid is what was already in the system,"" Neil Johnson, a physicist at George Washington University who studies online extremism, said. ""It was primed for that at the end of 2019.”

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

With many Covid-19 vaccines in the works, health officials have warned that public adoption will be crucial to ensure that enough of the population is immunized to stop the spread of the virus. Experts say there isn't an exact threshold for the percentage of people that need to get vaccinated to stop the virus' spread, but it is expected to be at least 60 percent of the population.

But public sentiment about the vaccines is mixed. Only 42 percent of Americans said “yes” to whether they’d get a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available, according to a YouGov poll released in August. A poll from the Pew Research Center published in September found a significant decline from May to September in people who said they would get the vaccine if it were immediately available.

Johnson and a team of researchers published a paper in Nature in May that suggested the anti-vaccination movement bore a big responsibility for such hesitancy. It showed that although membership in online anti-vaccination groups was smaller than in pro-vaccination groups, there were more of them, their messages were more diverse, emotive and often persuading, and they were better at spreading those messages outside their groups, meaning they were able to reach more people.

Research from a forthcoming paper from Johnson and his team, currently in review for publication, shows members of communities previously considered unrelated or “undecided” on vaccines — groups for pet lovers, parent school groups, yoga fans and foodies, for instance — are increasingly connecting with the anti-vaccination movement.

“It’s like a tumor growth,” Johnson said.

While the anti-vaccination activists’ favored platform, Facebook, has taken a number of steps recently to limit the reach of anti-vaccine content, the movement has thrived during the pandemic — a success largely due to a pivot toward Covid-19 misinformation and a communication strategy that’s allowed the anti-vaccination message to circumvent platforms’ policy enforcement and reach users outside its network.

Facebook spokesperson Andrea Vallone said in an emailed statement that the company has worked to connect people with accurate information about vaccines and banned misleading ads.

""We also continue to remove misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to imminent physical harm and direct people to our COVID information Center, which is available in 189 countries,"" she said.

A report by the London-based nonprofit organization Center for Countering Digital Hate found that the anti-vaccination movement gained about 8 million followers since 2019. Conspiracy theories about a coming Covid-19 vaccine have flooded social media, particularly on Instagram and Facebook, according to a new report from First Draft, a global nonprofit organization that researches online misinformation.

Such conspiracy theories (which purported the vaccine to be a clever cover for various forms of population control by a government “deep state,” private philanthropists or even Satan) weren’t limited to anti-vaccine fringe groups, First Draft reported, but were resonating with outside networks. Disparate communities including Libertarian, New Age, QAnon and anti-government groups, as well as more mainstream communities, seem to be uniting around the opposition to a coming Covid-19 vaccine.

The biggest pages banned by Facebook had already been preparing for a crackdown.

Facebook removed the page for the online anti-vaccination show The HighWire this month for violating policies on ""misinformation that could cause physical harm,"" the company said. YouTube had removed the show’s channel in July after reports that host Del Bigtree was downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic on his show and suggesting viewers intentionally expose themselves to Covid-19.

According to a post on the Facebook page for Bigtree’s nonprofit organization, Informed Consent Action Network, The HighWire had published more than 500 videos that attracted more than 30 million views. The page had 360,500 followers when it was deleted.

A HighWire account remains active on Facebook-owned Instagram, where it has 199,000 followers. Bigtree did not return a request for comment.

But it wasn’t vaccine misinformation that got social media’s most popular and prolific anti-vaccination activist banned from Facebook this month. In the end, after years of building an audience on Facebook, Larry Cook, a California social media marketer, and his 200,000-member private group, Stop Mandatory Vaccination, were removed for violating the platform’s policies against promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Cook, who did not respond to a request for comment, had been warning his fans of a coming ban and promoting his accounts on 11 other alternative platforms for months.

Cook’s and Bigtree’s pages and groups had continued to grow on Facebook despite a move in March 2019 to diminish the reach of anti-vaccine content during a measles outbreak and subsequent measures during the pandemic to downrank health misinformation in reaction to the World Health Organization’s warnings against “conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.”

Researchers have observed that livestreaming features provided a way for anti-vaccine activists to continue to reach their audience. Covid-19 in particular also led to significant followings for prominent anti-vaccine figures, said Renee DiResta, who studies disinformation as the research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

“The anti-vaccine movement recognized that [Covid-19] was an opportunity to create content, so when people were searching for it, they would find anti-vaccine content,” she said. “They saw this as an opportunity not only to erode confidence in the Covid vaccine, but also to make people hesitant about routine childhood immunizations, as well.”

But efforts to move beyond Facebook have had limited success.

Their audience “may not know where to go and how to navigate to those platforms,” said Kolina Koltai, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, who studies the anti-vaccine movement.

Despite the promotion, only a handful of users have followed Cook and Bigtree to those new platforms.

“Too many people are deeply invested into Facebook, which has the distinct advantage because that is the platform people are on, it is easy to navigate, and it is how users stay connected to friends and families,"" Koltai said.

And users need not switch platforms to maintain the link to the greater anti-vaccination movement. An unknowable number of private groups remain, spaces that have been hubs for misinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. These include the 224,000-member Vaccination Re-education Discussion Forum, a private anti-vaccination group exclusively focused on Covid-19 vaccines.

“It's like an insurgency,” Johnson said. “And the hard thing about battling an insurgency is we never quite knew where they were. There was almost like an invisible network behind them. Often, the groups that were most prominent, the ones coming to your attention because they were the biggest, didn't necessarily mean that they were the important ones in the network.""

His new research shows the anti-vaccination movement has effectively used the pandemic to reach more than 100 million susceptible Facebook users, and seems to be winning the battle for hearts and minds.

As such, banning accounts with large followings is unlikely to have much real impact on the larger anti-vaccination movement.

""The anti-vaccination network is all about passing on narratives, passing on stories, supporting each other, just like an insurgency,"" Johnson said. ""And just like an insurgency, it is embedded with the mainstream civilian population as it were. And that is their strength.”",MSNBC,"['misinformation', 'varied', 'covid19', 'online', 'face', 'antivaccination', 'movement', 'antivaccine', 'facebook', 'powerful', 'vaccines', 'groups', 'vaccine', 'reach']",0
2022-03-23 18:19:02+00:00,23,"Moderna said Wednesday its Covid-19 vaccine generated a strong immune response and was generally well-tolerated in kids ages 6 months up to 6 years.

The drugmaker said two 25-microgram doses of the vaccine, a quarter of the dose given to those 18 and older, produced an antibody response similar to what was seen in a clinical trial of adults.

Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic

For the approximately 6,900 children in the trials, the majority of side effects were ""mild or moderate,"" and no cases of a rare heart condition called myocarditis were reported, the company said.

Protection against infection from the omicron variant of the coronavirus was low. For children ages 6 months to 2 years, efficacy was 43.7 percent, and in children ages 2 to 6, it was only 37.5 percent. Moderna said the majority of the infections were mild. There were no cases of severe illness, hospitalization or death.

The findings may come as welcome news to some parents. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that during the surge of the omicron variant, which began in late December, the hospitalization rate for infants and children up to age 4 was about five times the rate during the peak of the delta variant last summer and fall.

Moderna's vaccine should reduce the risk of hospitalization or serious illness in kids, even if it doesn't stop infection, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto.

Young kids ""can still have severe outcomes, although it is much less frequent compared to older cohorts,"" he said.

Moderna said it plans to submit the data to the Food and Drug Administration and other regulators in the coming weeks.

It's hard to predict what action the FDA will take, given the lower efficacy, said infectious diseases expert Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, former FDA chief scientist.

""FDA could decide the data are sufficient for emergency authorization given that there is not another vaccine available at present for this age group,"" he said. ""However, kids this age, if otherwise healthy and without other medical issues, are usually at low risk of complications of Covid so how widely the vaccine would be used or recommended is unclear.""

Most children in the age group are ineligible to receive a Covid vaccine; the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been authorized for use in the U.S. for people as young as 5. Moderna’s vaccine has been authorized only for adults.

Will parents bother getting their kids the vaccine? John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Weill Cornell Medical College, said: ""Some might. Some.""

Bogoch agreed, saying uptake of the vaccine in this age group may be ""moderate,"" given kids are less likely to get severely ill.

Pfizer said last month that it was postponing its rolling application to the FDA to expand the use of its vaccine for kids under 5 after it found that two doses of its shot didn’t generate a strong enough immune response in kids ages 2 to 4.

The Pfizer vaccine dose for young kids is 3 micrograms, lower than the 25 micrograms Moderna tested for the age group.

Pfizer said at the time that it would wait for its data on a three-dose series of the vaccine, because it believes three doses “may provide a higher level of protection.""

While Moderna is asking the FDA to authorize two doses of its vaccine for kids under 6, the company said Wednesday it is preparing to evaluate the potential of a booster dose for all children.

Goodman of Georgetown University said a third shot, or booster dose, may enhance the protection provided by the Moderna vaccine.

He said it's unclear if the protection of the first two doses will drop off further with time, as has been seen in adults who received the primary series.

2022-03-15 15:02:03+00:00,48,"“The ‘zero-Covid’ measures will not eventually stop the virus from getting in. They’ll only postpone it,” said Ben Cowling, chair professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health. “In Hong Kong, we won’t be able to stop an outbreak once it gets established, and that’s exactly what’s happened now.”

Omicron is tearing through densely populated Hong Kong much the way it has elsewhere in the world. Officially, there have been more than 740,000 cases since the outbreak began in late December, out of a population of 7.4 million. But researchers at the University of Hong Kong estimate that 3.6 million people, or almost half the population, have contracted the virus in the current outbreak, and that the total will be 4.5 million.

Only about 35 percent of residents 80 and older have received two vaccine doses, compared with more than 80 percent of those 12 and above.

Similar outbreaks are occurring in places like Singapore and New Zealand, which are transitioning away from elimination policies. The difference, critics say, is that while those countries had detailed plans for how to manage them, the Hong Kong government did not.

“The government and the Hospital Authority weren’t prepared for the outbreak,” Adrian Kwan, an internist at a public hospital, said. “They had no contingency plan until late February. They did not anticipate what they would do when there was an outbreak in institutional settings, elderly homes in this case.”

Containing the virus in Hong Kong has depended on cutting off transmission chains as soon as they appeared. Any person with a confirmed infection, even if asymptomatic, was required to be hospitalized, while close contacts were sent to a government quarantine facility for up to three weeks. But once omicron took hold, cases rose faster than officials could respond.

Even amid mounting deaths — over 4,000, more than the toll recorded in Wuhan — the government has been slow to adjust its strategy, now called “dynamic zero Covid.” In recent weeks, officials announced plans for universal testing and scrambled to build more isolation facilities, baffling public health experts who said the priority should be saving lives. Public confusion as to when the testing would be conducted, as well as whether it would be accompanied by Hong Kong’s first real lockdown, set off rounds of panic-buying and led residents to flee the city in droves.

Last week, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced a major shift, saying universal testing would be postponed while the government focused on reducing the number of deaths and severe infections. The change was in line with recommendations from mainland Chinese officials who have intervened after President Xi Jinping expressed his dissatisfaction with Hong Kong’s handling of the outbreak. Mainland China is also dealing with its worst outbreak in two years, with multiple cities on lockdown, including Shenzhen, a city of 17.5 million just across the border from Hong Kong.

While Lam said officials have done their best to manage the pandemic, she admitted they did not do enough to encourage older adults to get vaccinated. Only about 35 percent of residents 80 and older have received two vaccine doses, compared with more than 80 percent of those 12 and above.",MSNBC,"['zerocovid', 'outbreak', 'virus', 'highest', 'testing', 'worlds', 'officials', 'death', 'residents', 'older', 'rate', '80', 'hong', 'went', 'public', 'kong']",0
2022-03-11 00:36:02+00:00,11,"Last week, Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, announced that almost two years after he contracted Covid-19, he has lingering effects from the illness. The senator, who described having a “24/7” tingling sensation, told The Washington Post on Wednesday, “I tell people it feels like all my nerves have had like five cups of coffee.”

That day, Kaine announced legislation that would improve research on the effects of the condition while also trying to improve access to services for people who need them.

One study found that about half of the people who contract Covid-19 will have lingering symptoms.

One study found that about half of the people who contract Covid will have lingering symptoms, which means Kaine and the many people who experience so-called long Covid can be considered part of one of the largest minority groups in the country: the disability community. As disability rights activist Rebecca Cokley has written, the term “disability,” as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, is broad and inclusive enough to welcome various people who otherwise would not be considered disabled.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people with long Covid experience “brain fog,” fatigue or symptoms that worsen after physical activity, among others. This could impede people’s ability to work long term or limit the type of work they can do.

These new denizens under the broadening tent of disability will redefine what the disability rights movement will look like, as veterans of the United States' wars, polio survivors and people who are victims of gun violence did before them. They will force America to rethink how it must remain accessible to people with disabilities.

Kaine introduced the legislation with Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who became disabled after losing both of her legs when her helicopter in Iraq was shot down.

It’s important that the bill include not just research into the illness but also expanded access to services. Sadly, many of these newly minted Americans with disabilities will find that accessing the services can be just as grueling and debilitating as the actual effects of long Covid. America’s safety net is already strained; it’s not strong enough to adequately serve those who have been requesting services even as Covid causes a whole new swath of people to request them. Still, Washington has appeared uninterested in fixing that safety net.

The clearest example of this comes in Supplemental Security Income, a cash welfare program meant to help blind and disabled people meet needs like clothing and shelter. But the program imposes Spartan restrictions and is only accessible to single people with $2,000 or fewer in assets and married couples with $3,000 or fewer. That asset limit means people who marry are often denied SSI benefits or have their benefit levels reduced, as one 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service found. Married people who have recently been disabled by long Covid may be in for a shock when they learn that their marriage to the person they love means they could be denied an essential welfare program.

That limit on assets has not been updated since 1989. As University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack has written, if SSI asset limits had kept pace with inflation, they would be $9,500 and $12,675. But those dismal savings levels often prevent people with disabilities from being able to have any kind of financial stability or semblance of comfort. For context, the maximum monthly benefit amount for recipients is $794, which is about 74 percent of the federal poverty level.

All of these onerous restrictions make receiving SSI as degrading as possible and results in people who receive SSI fearing going one dollar above $2,000 lest they be sent into financial ruin. Social Security and Social Security Disability Insurance are paid for with payroll taxes, which solidifies the idea that they are “earned”; SSI is paid for with general revenue and income taxes, solidifying the idea it wasn't “earned.”

Married people who have been disabled by long Covid may be in for a shock when they learn their marriage means they could be denied an essential welfare program.

That stigma likely explains why SSI has been allowed to wither on the vine. Even 35 years ago, at a 1987 hearing, it was called “The Forgotten Safety Net.” It is a safety net with fibers that are slowly tearing apart, and now people who are newly disabled might fall into a net that risks tearing beneath them.

The cruelest aspect of all this is that the fixes to SSI are simple. Congress could index the asset limits to inflation, so disabled people’s savings don’t have to be at starvation levels. During his presidential campaign, Joe Biden endorsed lifting the marriage penalty and raising the federal benefit rate to 100 percent of the federal poverty level.

However, the administration excluded these fixes from Biden’s proposed ""Build Back Better"" plan as a means to appease fiscal conservatives within the party, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia — only for Manchin to still announce his opposition in December. It is also highly unlikely that they would be included in Manchin’s supposed slimmed-down offer.

Sadly, it appears that the induction into the disability community for those who have long Covid will require them doing the same thing their predecessors did: raising hell to receive basic necessities.",MSNBC,"['long', 'americas', 'net', 'making', 'disabled', 'exposing', 'tattered', 'services', 'welfare', 'safety', 'ssi', 'means', 'covid', 'disability']",0

Reporters from NBC News successfully ordered second batches of Covid-19 tests on Monday, though a message on the website still advises those who previously ordered tests to “check back later to place a second order.”

The Postal Service announced last week that it had delivered 270 million tests in 68 million packages to American households since shipments began in January.

“The Postal Service immediately pivoted from a successful 2021 peak holiday season to focus on the delivery of America’s COVID-19 test kits,” the statement said.

At the peak of the omicron variant's spread in the U.S. in January, tests were scarce and in high demand, NBC News reported. But Covid rates have since plummeted, and the supply of tests is less constrained.

Since Jan. 15, the Biden administration has been requiring insurance companies to reimburse people for up to eight over-the-counter, at-home Covid tests per month.

In his State of the Union address, Biden also announced a ""test-to-treat"" program at pharmacies, enabling pharmacists to issue prescriptions for antiviral pills on the spot for people who test positive for Covid.

As of Friday, an average of 3.8 percent of Covid tests were coming back positive nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",MSNBC,"['postal', 'test', 'covid19', 'online', 'tests', 'ordered', 'biden', 'service', 'free', 'order', 'covid', 'covidtestsgov']",0
2022-03-07 15:03:09+00:00,47,"BANGKOK — The official global death toll from Covid-19 eclipsed 6 million on Monday — underscoring that the pandemic, now entering its third year, is far from over.

The milestone, recorded by Johns Hopkins University, is the latest tragic reminder of the unrelenting nature of the pandemic even as people are shedding masks, travel is resuming and businesses are reopening around the globe.

Remote Pacific islands, whose isolation had protected them for more than two years, are just now grappling with their first outbreaks and deaths, fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant.

Hong Kong, which is seeing deaths soar, is testing its entire population of 7.5 million three times this month as it clings to mainland China’s “zero-Covid” strategy.

As death rates remain high in Poland, Hungary, Romania and other Eastern European countries, the region has seen more than 1.5 million refugees arrive from war-torn Ukraine, a country with poor vaccination coverage and high rates of cases and deaths.

And despite its wealth and vaccine availability, the United States is nearing 1 million reported deaths on its own.

Death rates worldwide are still highest among people unvaccinated against the virus, said Tikki Pang, a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore’s medical school and co-chair of the Asia Pacific Immunization Coalition.

“This is a disease of the unvaccinated — look what is happening in Hong Kong right now, the health system is being overwhelmed,” said Pang, the former director of research policy and cooperation with the World Health Organization. “The large majority of the deaths and the severe cases are in the unvaccinated, vulnerable segment of the population.”

It took the world seven months to record its first million deaths from the virus after the pandemic began in early 2020. Four months later another million people had died, and 1 million have died every three months since, until the death toll hit 5 million at the end of October. Now it has reached 6 million — more than the populations of Berlin and Brussels combined, or the entire state of Maryland.

But despite the enormity of the figure, the world undoubtedly hit its 6 millionth death some time ago. Poor record-keeping and testing in many parts of the world has led to an undercount in coronavirus deaths, in addition to excess deaths related to the pandemic but not from actual Covid-19 infections, like people who died from preventable causes but could not receive treatment because hospitals were full.

Edouard Mathieu, head of data for the Our World in Data portal, said that — when countries’ excess mortality figures are studied — as many as nearly four times the reported death toll have likely died because of the pandemic.

An analysis of excess deaths by a team at The Economist estimates that the number of Covid-19 deaths is between 14.1 million and 23.8 million.

“Confirmed deaths represent a fraction of the true number of deaths due to Covid, mostly because of limited testing, and challenges in the attribution of the cause of death,” Mathieu told The Associated Press. “In some, mostly rich, countries that fraction is high and the official tally can be considered to be fairly accurate, but in others it is highly underestimated.”

The United States has the biggest official death toll in the world, but the numbers have been trending downward over the last month.

Lonnie Bailey lost his 17-year-old nephew, Carlos Nunez Jr., who contracted Covid-19 last April — the same month Kentucky opened his age group to vaccinations. The Louisville resident said the family is still suffering, including Carlos’ younger sibling, who had to be hospitalized himself and still has lingering symptoms. The aggressive reopening of the country has been jarring for them to witness.

“For us it is hard to let our guard down; it’s going to take a while for us to adjust,” Bailey said.

The world has seen more than 445 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, and new weekly cases have been declining recently in all regions except for the Western Pacific, which includes China, Japan and South Korea, among others, the World Health Organization reported this week.

Although the overall figures in the Pacific islands seeing their first outbreaks are small compared to larger countries, they are significant among their tiny populations and threaten to overwhelm fragile health care systems.

“Given what we know about Covid ... it’s likely to hit them for the next year or so at least,” said Katie Greenwood, head of the Red Cross Pacific delegation.

Tonga reported its first outbreak after the virus arrived with international aid vessels following the Jan. 15 eruption of a massive volcano, followed by a tsunami. It now has several hundred cases, but — with 66 percent of its population fully vaccinated — it has so far reported people suffering mostly mild symptoms and no deaths.

The Solomon Islands saw the first outbreak in January and now has thousands of cases and more than 100 deaths. The actual death toll is likely much higher, with the capital’s hospital overwhelmed and many dying at home, Greenwood said.

Only 12 percent of Solomon Islanders are fully vaccinated, though the outbreak has provided new impetus to the country’s vaccination campaign and 29 percent now have at least one shot.

Global vaccine disparity continues, with only 6.95 percent of people in low-income countries fully vaccinated, compared to more than 73 percent in high-income nations, according to Our World in Data.

In a good sign, at the end of last month Africa surpassed Europe in the number of doses administered daily, but only about 12.5 percent of its population has received two shots.

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still pressing for more vaccines, though it has been a challenge. Some shipments arrive with little warning for countries’ health systems and others near the expiration date — forcing doses to be destroyed.

Eastern Europe has been particularly hard hit by the omicron variant, and with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a new risk has emerged as hundreds of thousands of people flee to places like Poland on crowded trains. Health officials there have been offering free vaccinations to all refugees, but have not been making them test upon arrival or quarantine.

“This is really tragic because great stress has a very negative effect on natural immunity and increases the risk of infections,” said Anna Boron-Kaczmarska, a Polish infectious disease specialist. “They are in very high stress, being afraid for their lives, the lives of their children, they family members.”

Mexico has reported 300,000 deaths, but with little testing, a government analysis of death certificates puts the real number closer to 500,000. Still, four weeks of falling infection rates have left health officials optimistic.

In India, where the world was shocked by images of open-air pyres of bodies burned as crematoria were overwhelmed, the scars are fading as the number of new cases and deaths has slowed.

India has recorded more than 500,000 deaths, but experts believe its true toll is in the millions, primarily from the delta variant. Migrants from India’s vast hinterland are now returning to its megacities in search of jobs, and the streets are packed with traffic. Shopping malls have customers, albeit still masked, while schools and universities are welcoming students after a months-long gap.

In Britain, infections have fallen since an omicron-driven surge in December, but remain high. England has now lifted all restrictions, including mask mandates and the requirement that all who test positive isolate at home.

With about 250,000 reported deaths, the African continent’s smaller death toll is thought to stem from underreporting, as well as a generally younger and less mobile population.

“Africa is a big question mark for me, because it has been relatively spared from the worst so far, but it could just be a time bomb,” Pang said, noting its low vaccination rates.

In South Africa, Soweto resident Thoko Dube said she received news of the deaths of two family members on the same day in January 2021 — a month before the country received its first vaccines.

It has been difficult, but “the family is coping,” she said. “We have accepted it because it has been happening to other families.”",MSNBC,"['countries', 'world', 'surpasses', 'deaths', 'pacific', 'toll', 'health', 'cases', 'pandemic', 'death', 'million', 'global', 'reported']",0

Biden has no inflation plan With rising rates of inflation overtaking Covid as Americans’ primary concern, voters who tuned into Biden’s speech were probably listening closely for the president’s plan to reduce the pressure on their wallets. They didn’t hear one. The president capably detailed the fiendish nature of inflation, the causes of which are in many ways out of this administration’s control. To address those causes, though, the president spent much of his time expressing his support for the failed policies of the mid-20th century and pitching his moribund legislative agenda. Biden paid special attention to drug prices, using the high cost of insulin as his primary example. His solution to rising prices was to simply cap them at an arbitrary level ($35). For the rest of the productive economy, Biden touted his administration’s efforts to repatriate industry so that more goods will be made in America (at higher wage costs, which will be passed onto the consumer). Who wouldn’t want to whip inflation now by relying on protectionism and price controls? It’s a politically appealing idea; it’s too bad it doesn’t work. Biden: Addressing inflation is 'top priority' March 2, 2022 02:29 When he wasn’t pledging his support for Richard Nixon’s first term agenda, Biden was pitching the Build Back Better bill’s constituent features as a cure-all for our economic woes. Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. Lower the cost of college. Improve the conditions in nursing homes. Make daycare and pre-K education more affordable. And pass the so-called “Pro Act,” which would make it more difficult to hire and retain contract labor. How all this combats inflation is the subject of much debate — a debate that has been had for months. Indeed, that debate has been definitively settled in favor of the Build Back Better bill’s opponents. By exhuming BBB from its legislative grave merely to prop up the corps, Americans who desperately wanted to hear how Biden will help address inflation got their answer: He can’t. Share this -

Why Sen. Elizabeth Warren likely loved this Biden remark Okay!! Earlier in the evening, I made the point that inflation is bad because of Covid but also price gouging by companies. After my comments, a former aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., texted me to say that was a point the senator has been emphatic about. Well, I am sure then she was glad to hear this from President Biden tonight: ""Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers."" Will folks appreciate that President Biden sees the problem of inflation from all sides? Paging Sen. Warren! Wondering if the Working Families Party edits their response to the State of the Union to include this? We will be watching. Share this -

It was unclear whether they were booing Biden’s reference to the bill, or Biden’s reference to conservatives favoring the ultra-wealthy.

Biden has a not-so-secret plan to fight inflation Biden described America as having a “choice” in how to fight inflation, which increased more between February 2021 and February 2022 than it has during any other year in the last four decades. “One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer,” Biden said. ""I have a better plan to fight inflation.” Instead, Biden wants to “lower [Americans’] costs, not your wages.” That will involve reducing dependence on foreign supply chains, making more products like cars and semiconductors in the U.S. and adding “jobs where you can earn a good living,” Biden said. That’s all great in theory, especially since Republicans have been hammering Biden’s administration on rising costs at home. But history shows that there’s not much Congress or the White House can really do to get businesses — including many that are struggling to meet increased demand — to accept lower profits instead of passing on those costs to consumers. Instead, it’s mostly up to the Federal Reserve to tackle inflation — but that doesn’t sound as good to voters, especially if it means higher interest rates. Share this -

Biden announces U.S. will join allies in closing skies to Russian aircraft Biden just unveiled a noteworthy policy announcement: The U.S. will ban Russian aircraft from entering U.S. airspace. It’s something U.S. officials have contemplated rolling out for days, and it means the U.S. is joining European allies in yet another measure to further isolate Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. As NBC News reported, the European Union on Sunday closed its skies to Russian aircraft “owned, chartered or otherwise controlled by a Russian legal or natural person.” Canada has also enacted a ban. U.S. officials have indicated that they believe Americans can get out of Russia by other means, such as taking trains. The move adds yet another tool that the West is using to quite literally cut Russia off from the outside world as punishment.

The state of our union is _____. I asked people on Twitter this afternoon how they would answer this prompt if they were President Joe Biden. The state of our union is _____. The answers ranged from meh, to “resilient” (my personal favorite, from former MSNBC anchor Kendis Gibson), to complicated, to perilous. They’re all true. Most people agreed we were far better off this year than last year. Still, this year’s State of the Union address will feature a wide and conflicting range of emotions, befitting 2021-2022. Mark Cianca had this diplomatic suggestion for the president: I was going to say ""challenged"", but read someone else's comments ""...at a crossroads between great peril and great promise."" That sounds more presidential. — 🇺🇦 Mark Cianca 🇺🇦 (@markcianca) March 1, 2022 And of course, the danger the Ukrainian people are facing with such bravery right now certainly puts our own problems in context.

Biden's Cabinet will be in the audience In keeping with custom, almost all of the Biden Cabinet will be in the audience for the State of the Union tonight. (Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, selected as the “designated survivor,” will likely be the lone absence.) Traditionally, the Cabinet accompanies the president to show their support for him and provide an image of unity and strength. But unlike past presidents — most notably Donald Trump — the members of Biden’s Cabinet have taken a fairly low profile over the administration’s first year. (They’re likely taking cues from their boss, who has apparently taken a low profile to provide a contrast with his predecessor’s constant preening. While a welcome move, this decision might well be backfiring.) The State of the Union presents an opportunity to promote the president’s policies and brag about his successes, so Biden’s Cabinet is there in force. But this should mark the start of that promotional work, not the end. The Cabinet can be effective surrogates for their respective fields of responsibility, and the administration would be wise not to put them back in storage after the night’s pageantry.

Reader question: Will Biden cancel student debt? One readers asks how Biden might address student loans: student loan pause and cancellation. Will it continue and will he cancel debt? — Tell it like it is (@llj23566) February 26, 2022 Great question! To answer in reverse order, it seems unlikely given his past statements that Biden will outright cancel student debt on his own. He’s said repeatedly that he’d sign legislation that would cancel up to $10,000 of student loan debt — emphasis on “legislation.” But some progressive members of Congress argue he could cancel up to $50,000 worth of debt on his own through executive action. Biden hasn’t been swayed so far but stranger things have happened. As for the pause, no idea! The White House thankfully realized back in December that letting the pause lapse without a long-term plan would be an easily avoidable mistake and extended it until May 1. Now, are they willing to take that political hit in a midterm year where things are already shaky for Democrats? As the kids say: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Share this -

Reader question: Why is the U.S. scared of Putin? One reader asks: Why are we scared of Putin? That’s what I want to know? Aren’t we the Super Power? The last beacon of hope and democracy? — PMJ (@MariMarKenla) February 26, 2022 It’s true that American military and economic might are unmatched in the global arena — but that doesn’t mean that other countries can’t do serious damage to the United States. Russia is a former superpower and, at the very least, a regional great power that has vast natural resources, robust and sophisticated military capabilities, and, most critically, a serious nuclear arsenal. The are many reasons the Biden administration and most national security analysts are wary of any kind of direct clash with Moscow. Ukraine is a far more vital interest for Russia, meaning it could cost the U.S. dearly to fight for something that isn’t of existential importance to the U.S. What’s more, in terms of conventional warfare, Russia has a massive home field advantage. And most importantly, the possibility of serious escalation with a nuclear power is incredibly high-stakes and dangerous. One misjudgment or misunderstanding of the other party and a nuclear confrontation is a real possibility. Share this -

Rubio’s over-the-top Covid protest Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said he won’t be squeezing the State of the Union address into his schedule because he’s a very busy man. “I don’t have time to go take a Covid test today. I only take a test if I’m sick,” the senator told reporters Monday. Of course, what Rubio really meant to do was suggest that he considers the Covid testing requirement for attendees an intolerable demand. In fact, Rubio seems to think taking simple measures to prevent a gathering of the country’s most powerful politicians from becoming a superspreader event is a sign of creeping totalitarianism. During his speech Friday at CPAC, Rubio said the SOTU requirements are “what happens after 20 years of infusing this Marxist thought process into every aspect of our lives, and now we’ve come face-to-face with it."" This protest is probably foreshadowing. Even though the U.S. is dropping a whole host of Covid-related requirements at breakneck speed, expect more Republican politicians to make a show of objecting theatrically to the requirements that remain.

2022-02-23 13:46:01+00:00,20,"Vaccines that are not assigned by COVAX in this round can be allocated again later.

While wealthy countries are opening up their economies, the WHO and other public health experts warn that the slow roll-out of vaccines in poorer regions will give the coronavirus a chance to mutate again and potentially create new variants.

The low demand for vaccines in the January allocation is partly explained by recent increases in supplies. COVAX has already assigned tens of millions of doses to be delivered in the first quarter and delivered its billionth dose in January.

Officials involved in vaccine distribution said that meant countries were reluctant to take on more doses that they would not be able to use.

A summit to address distribution challenges is taking place on Wednesday in Abuja, Nigeria, convened by the African Union’s Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance with WHO, Gavi and others rolling out shots across Africa attending.

There had been hopes that African countries would be able to administer billions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines given their experience in dealing with deadly diseases from Ebola to malaria.

But two years into the crisis, a survey seen by Reuters by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in January on the equipment needed to ramp up vaccine distribution highlighted some of the challenges.

It found “critical gaps” across 44 of the African Union’s 55 member states: 24 countries said they needed fridges, 18 were in need of deep freezers, 22 required walk-in freezers and 16 did not have sufficient walk-in cold rooms.

The problem is particularly acute for COVAX because the Pfizer-BioNTech shot that needs to be kept super-cold has replaced AstraZeneca’s vaccine as the main one being offered by the global program.

Some African countries, such as Burundi and Guinea, have gaps at every point in the cold chain, from national level to local distribution centres, the UNICEF survey showed.

The findings are likely to underscore growing concerns that COVAX did not invest quickly enough in infrastructure and equipment for countries it was delivering vaccines to.

The issue is exacerbated by a lack of funding and because countries have not had enough notice of deliveries — particularly donations — making it harder for them to plan vaccination campaigns, public health officials have said.

Officials involved in the distribution of vaccines in Africa also said more focus needed to be placed on communicating the importance of getting vaccinated — and addressing disinformation.

“Communication is one of the biggest issues ... if we don’t get the messaging right, everything else we are doing is futile,” one of the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Money has also started to dry up for global initiatives as richer nations seek to move on from Covid.

Gavi says it has only raised $195 million out of the $5.2 billion it has asked for this quarter. The money is used to procure and ship vaccines, as well as provide syringes and delivery support in countries.

Efforts to distribute tests and therapeutics, such as the new antivirals, are facing similar cashflow issues, according to Philippe Duneton, executive director of Unitaid.

“There is not a lot of money left from what we have received,” he told Reuters, referring to therapeutics particularly.

“There is around $100 million, but we need more to make access to these drugs, including access to tests, in a way that is affordable for the international community.”",MSNBC,"['countries', 'walkin', 'outstrips', 'supply', 'demand', 'program', 'doses', 'distribution', 'africa', 'african', 'vaccines', 'global', 'covax', 'vaccine', 'needed', 'covid']",0
2022-02-18 16:01:04+00:00,19,"OTTAWA, Ontario — Police aggressively pushed back protesters in Canada’s besieged capital on Saturday, towing away trucks, arresting dozens of protesters and finally retaking control of the streets in front of the country’s Parliament buildings. Scores of trucks left under the increasing pressure, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The street in front of Parliament Hill, the collection of government offices that includes the Parliament buildings, was the heart of the protests. It had been occupied by protesters and their trucks since late last month, turning into a carnival on weekends.

“They are trying to push us all away,” said one protester, Jeremy Glass of Shelburne, Ontario, as authorities forced the crowds to move further from the Parliament buildings. “The main camp is seized now. We’re no longer in possession of it.”

Canadian authorities also announced they had used emergency powers to seize 76 bank accounts connected to protesters, totaling roughly $3.2 million ($2.5 million U.S.).

On Saturday, they also closed a bridge into the nation’s capital from Quebec to prevent a renewed influx of protesters.

Police said protesters remained aggressive, and pepper spray had been used to protect officers.

Around midday, protest organizers said they had ordered truckers to move away from Parliament Hill, decrying the police’s actions as “abuses of power.”

“To move the trucks will require time,” organizers said in a statement. “We hope that (police) will show judicious restraint.”

Earlier, Ottawa police addressed the protesters in a tweet: “We told you to leave. We gave you time to leave. We were slow and methodical, yet you were assaultive and aggressive with officers and the horses. Based on your behavior, we are responding by including helmets and batons for our safety.”

Police said one protester launched a gas canister and was arrested as they advanced.

At least 47 people were arrested Saturday, police said. More than 100 were arrested Friday, mostly on mischief charges, and nearly two dozen vehicles had been towed, including all of those blocking one of the city’s major streets, authorities said. One officer had a minor injury, but no protesters were hurt, interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell said.

Those arrested included four protest leaders. One received bail while the others remained jailed.

Tow truck operators wearing neon-green ski masks, with their companies’ decals taped over on their trucks to conceal their identities, arrived under police escort and started removing hundreds of big rigs, campers and other vehicles parked shoulder to shoulder near Parliament. Police smashed through the door of at least one camper before hauling it away.

The crackdown on the self-styled Freedom Convoy began Friday morning, when hundreds of police, some in riot gear and some carrying automatic weapons, descended into the protest zone and began leading demonstrators away in handcuffs through the snowy streets as holdout truckers blared their horns.

The capital and its paralyzed streets represented the movement’s last stronghold after weeks of demonstrations and blockades that shut down border crossings into the U.S. and created one of the most serious tests yet for Trudeau. They also shook Canada’s reputation for civility, with some blaming America’s influence.

The Freedom Convoy demonstrations initially focused on Canada’s vaccine requirement for truckers entering the country but soon morphed into a broad attack on COVID-19 precautions and Trudeau’s government.

Ottawa residents complained of being harassed and intimidated by the truckers and obtained a court injunction to stop their incessant honking.

Trudeau portrayed the protesters as members of a “fringe” element. Canadians have largely embraced the country’s COVID-19 restrictions, with the vast majority vaccinated, including an estimated 90% of the nation’s truckers. Some of the vaccine and mask mandates imposed by the provinces are already falling away rapidly.

The biggest border blockade, at the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, disrupted the flow of auto parts between the two countries and forced the industry to curtail production. Authorities lifted the siege last weekend after arresting dozens of protesters.

The final border blockade, in Manitoba, across from North Dakota, ended peacefully on Wednesday.

2022-02-15 17:18:06+00:00,13,"Tennis star Novak Djokovic has said he is willing to sacrifice competing in upcoming tournaments so he can remain unvaccinated against Covid-19.

In his first interview since being deported from Australia last month, the world's top-ranked tennis player spoke about the saga that became a lightning rod for the global debate over coronavirus measures.

“The principles of decision-making on my body are more important than any title, or anything else,” Djokovic said in an interview broadcast Tuesday by the BBC.

“I understand the consequences of my decision,” he said, confirming he is still not vaccinated and is willing to sacrifice titles — and potentially even the chance to overtake Rafael Nadal’s record haul of 21 Grand Slams — to remain that way.

Djokovic, 34, was embroiled in a weekslong saga over his vaccination status in the lead-up to last month's Australian Open. He saw his visa cancelled, reinstated, and canceled again by the country’s immigration minister, who cited fears the high-profile athlete’s presence would stoke anti-vaccine sentiment.

The Serbian star's deportation from the country won him support from opponents of vaccination mandates but denied him the chance to compete for a record-breaking title, which Nadal won instead.

Djokovic said he was prepared to lose out on future titles and the chance to make history for the sake of his personal beliefs.

“I understand that not being vaccinated today, I’m unable to travel to most of the tournaments at the moment. And that is the price I’m willing to pay,” he told the BBC, confirming he was prepared to sit out the upcoming French Open and Wimbledon.

France has enforced vaccine mandates in public spaces which could also see the top player denied entry to compete at Roland Garros in May.

The rules may however change in the coming months as Europe slowly eases its pandemic restrictions. New rules in force in England since last week allow unvaccinated people to enter with tests before and after their arrival.

Despite his stance, the athlete also sought to distance himself from the anti-vaccination movement of which he has become a hero.

""I was never against vaccination. I understand that globally everyone is trying to put a big effort to handling this virus and seeing hopefully an end soon to this virus and vaccination is probably the biggest effort that was made... I fully respect that,"" he said. ""But I have always represented and supported the freedom to choose what you put into your body.""

“I have never said I am part of that movement,"" the Serb added, referring to global opposition to vaccine mandates which has fueled protests and disruption in several Western countries in recent weeks. ""It’s really unfortunate that there has been this kind of misconception and wrong conclusion that has been made around the world.”",MSNBC,"['avoid', 'virus', 'tournaments', 'djokovic', 'understand', 'miss', 'won', 'vaccinated', 'chance', 'novak', 'vaccine', 'mandates', 'willing', 'covid', 'vaccination']",0
2022-02-15 03:30:15+00:00,126,"Covid-19's average daily death toll in the U.S. — some 2,200 people — is about the equivalent of 10 Boeing 737 jets crashing each day, but the American public seems numb to the magnitude of the loss, the strain on hospitals and the grief that those deaths are causing the people left behind.

One after another, states are lifting the mask mandates they put in place during the pandemic, leaving some Americans confused, indignant and unsure of what to do and to whom they should listen regarding Covid.

It was mostly Republican governors standing opposed to mitigation measures such as masks, but now we see Democrats doing the same.

Earlier in the pandemic, it was mostly Republican governors standing opposed to mitigation measures such as masks, but now we see Democrats doing the same. For example, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul cited the dramatic decline in cases as her basis for lifting restrictions without acknowledging that even in highly vaccinated New York City, most boroughs still were reporting a high transmission rate of Covid cases each day. In fact, the entire country, including every single state that has announced some loosening of restrictions, is still in a category of high transmission according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cases and hospitalizations are declining by double digits each day, but daily cases and deaths still exceed some of the worst surges prior to omicron. The CDC continues to recommend indoor masking including in schools, a recommendation that is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

So why the rush to lift mandates? In short, people are tired of Covid, including politicians who are reminded daily of their constituents’ fatigue and frustrations. There is no question that we all, to borrow Fannie Lou Hamer’s phrase, are sick and tired of being sick and tired but the all-or-none approach hasn’t worked. So far, getting rid of restrictions in response to declining numbers has only led us to the next surge. And the restrictions are reinstated only after cases escalate and hospitals again reach critical capacity.

During every phase of the pandemic, our response has been reactive, and along with those reactive responses has come a gradual acceptance of preventable loss of life and livelihood. Simply put, we are more willing to take our chances rather than exhibit caution because the cost of such caution is untenable. This particular time might be different due to the sheer numbers of Americans likely infected. Some combination of infection-related immunity and vaccine-induced immunity could provide enough of a wall of defense to fend off the worst of any future surge. Unfortunately, our ability to predict the future of a novel virus in a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic is still limited even with sophisticated surveillance efforts such as wastewater monitoring.

Millions of Americans are in a state of confusion as the policies adopted by traditionally cautious states such as California and New York diverge from the recommendations made by the CDC. The divergence may give the impression that the Biden administration and its top public health officials are out of touch with the sentiment of Americans. Why is the CDC doubling down on masks in the face of precipitous declines and rising animosity? Is the CDC overly cautious, or are all these states throwing caution to the wind?

The CDC is overly cautious, but, by design, it must be because it must make recommendations that accommodate a variety of situations and populations, including people with compromised immune systems. The agency has also learned from its mistakes; when it abruptly recommended removing indoor masks for vaccinated individuals in May, many public health experts criticized that policy change as too sudden and shortsighted.

The CDC is overly cautious, but it must be because it must make recommendations that accommodate a variety of populations.

The states don’t seem to have learned from the CDC’s mistakes, though; they have been quick to announce the end of mask mandates while providing little detail about how and when measures might need to be reinstituted.

Americans need a sensible way to navigate the peaks and valleys of the pandemic, including a way to objectively assess when certain mitigation measures need to be reinstated. This should include public health officials collecting and displaying data that matters, including reinfections, the number of prescriptions issued for oral antivirals and guidance for navigating long Covid. Given what we have gone through and the politicization of every aspect of this pandemic, the country would also benefit from a metric that assesses the public’s fatigue level. Because the public is no less tired than the politicians are. Just like politics is driving how politicians respond to the crisis, our psychology is likely to have more to do with how we respond to the threat of Covid than any recommendation from public health officials.

At the same time, it’s important that the American people remain vigilant because they may have to impose upon themselves sensible restrictions that government officials can’t or won’t.",MSNBC,"['wont', 'states', 'impose', 'measures', 'cdc', 'tired', 'public', 'restrictions', 'including', 'cases', 'pandemic', 'governments', 'mandates', 'masks', 'american', 'mask']",0

2022-02-08 13:03:02+00:00,10,"To quote the poet Nayvadius Wilburn: “Mask off.”

That was the mentality of three Democratic governors on the East Coast on Monday, as they announced plans to end school mask mandates in their states. It appeared to be a major turning point in the way these governors — whose states enacted some of the strictest Covid-19 mitigation measures at the start of the pandemic — are approaching the virus.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced his state will end its mandate requiring students and school officials to wear masks on March 7. Though the omicron variant caused Covid cases in New Jersey to surge in early January, infections and hospitalizations have since tapered off.

In a statement, Murphy cited the ""continued drop"" in cases, as well as the ""continued growth of vaccinations for our school-aged population,"" as his rationale for ending the mandate.

Delaware Gov. John Carney announced his state will lift its universal indoor mask mandate Friday, with the mask requirement for schools to be lifted on March 31.

“I want to be clear about this point — COVID is still circulating in our communities,"" Carney said in a statement. ""And the virus still poses a risk of serious illness, particularly among those who are not up to date on their vaccinations. But we have the tools to keep ourselves and each other safe.""

And in Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont said he will recommend the school's mask mandate end Feb. 28, leaving school districts to decide whether to require mask-wearing.

“I think today with boosters, given vaccines, given the N95 masks, you are in a better position to keep yourself safe, your child is in a better place to keep themselves safe,” Lamont said in a news briefing Monday.

The governors' announcements come not only during a time when Covid cases and deaths are declining in their respective states, but also at a time when Americans are increasingly discussing “Covid fatigue” and the nation's willingness to comply with Covid safety measures. Covid variants have shown themselves to be volatile and their impacts unpredictable.

Health officials have warned any change in Covid mitigation policies will need to be written in pencil, but Monday's announcements illustrate a shift in the ways officials who've been wary of the virus are approaching its spread — even if only a temporary one.

2022-02-08 01:56:02+00:00,20,"María Elena Bottazzi doesn't forget where she comes from. Her face softens as she, in the midst of complex scientific terms, speaks of Honduras as if she had left Tegucigalpa, its capital, yesterday.

“It never crossed my mind to look for a job at a multinational"" company, she said with a broad smile in a video interview with Noticias Telemundo. ""I am Central American and doing nonprofit projects is my way of giving back a little of what Honduras has given me.”

Together with Dr. Peter Hotez, Bottazzi, 56, a microbiologist, led the team from the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development that created the Corbevax vaccine for Covid-19, a patent-free drug that last month already received emergency authorization for use in India.

“Peter and I aspire to benefit people, which is why we created a vaccine for the poorest communities in the world. The team that we have built shares the same interest in promoting public health and, obviously, learning at the same time,” she said.

Corbevax is based on recombinant protein, a traditional technology that has been used for decades in well-established drugs such as hepatitis B and pertussis vaccines. This vaccine uses a careful amount of virus proteins in order to activate the body’s immune response, but without making patients sick.

To gain approval in India, two Phase III clinical trials were conducted at 33 research centers with more than 3,000 participants, ages 18 to 80. The tests determined that Corbevax was safe and well tolerated. The company said the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective against the original strain of Covid and more than 80 percent effective against the delta variant.

“It’s a much cheaper process than the messenger RNA technology that Pfizer or Moderna used. We chose the most scalable, reproducible and stable method with a yeast cell that ferments and coded it to produce these proteins,"" Bottazzi said. ""That means you don’t have any animal derivatives, everything is synthetic. In addition, anyone can replicate it and collaborate with us.""

María Elena Bottazzi, a Honduran microbiologist, and her team have for years focused on creating vaccines against largely neglected diseases. Hospital Infantil de Texas

'I was in shock'

Last week, Bottazzi received a call from Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-Texas, which she said turned out to be one of the great surprises of her life. Fletcher informed her that she had nominated Bottazzi and Hotez for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“The truth is that I was shocked, speechless. But we are very excited and grateful, because the simple fact that they have thought of us means that we are already winners,"" the scientist said, speaking with emotion.

Strategies to immunize the world’s population against Covid are moving slowly: About 59 percent of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to Our World in Data, an Oxford University initiative that analyzes government reports globally.

However, the most worrying figure is that less than 9 percent of residents in low-income countries have received a dose.

The inequality in the distribution of vaccines has caused great indignation among activist groups, political movements and high-ranking officials of the World Health Organization.

While science has given us hope in the form of vaccines, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in December, ""there is no doubt that the inequality in their distribution has caused many deaths.""

The quest for health equity

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Bottazzi and her team decided to use the knowledge they had cultivated during decades of research to develop a drug that would be “free for everyone,” as she often says.

“Everyone talks about equity, but nobody does anything. That is why we created Corbevax, although we are a small team and it took us longer than the large laboratories,"" she said. ""But we knew that it would not be enough with the projects of the multinationals, if we take into account the first and second doses, plus booster and pediatric doses, we are still missing 9,000 million doses,” she added.

For several years, Bottazzi and her team focused on creating vaccines against largely neglected diseases such as schistosomiasis (intestinal parasites) and Chagas' disease.

More than a decade ago, they began to investigate coronaviruses, when no one imagined the emergence of the pandemic that has disrupted health systems across the world. The team began developing vaccines for coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, until the funds they raised ran out.

“Our goal has always been to develop and manufacture cheap, durable vaccines to contribute to global health,” Bottazzi said.

When Covid began to spread around the world, researchers already knew of the technological advances that could help generate a drug to combat the novel coronavirus. But due to scarce public and private funding (among its private donors, a brand of vodka stands out; it brought the team a million dollars), it took them longer to manufacture the vaccine.

“We are looking for this concept of making transparent alliances, without patents, with partners who have the same outlook as we do, even if that is difficult and takes us a little longer,"" Bottazzi said. ""Then Biological E, a large vaccine manufacturer in India, became interested, which promoted the development and we managed to get the emergency authorization in India. Now we are in talks with other countries such as Indonesia and Bangladesh.""

As with many scientific feats, the creation of Corbevax is the product of past research that, at the time, didn't receive the attention and support it needed to further refine the processes and methods which were crucial to ultimately driving the drug forward.

Bottazzi warns that after the pandemic emergency is over, ""we must continue investing in science, we have to be prepared for the emergence of other diseases.""

Below, she answered several questions about the new vaccine she helped create.

What advantages does Corbevax offer, compared to other vaccines on the market?

The first thing is that its development is free, any government or company can contact us and we will give them the starter kit to start manufacturing. Our doses cost between $2 and $3, compared to the others. In recent trials, it’s over 80 percent effective with variants like beta and delta, and we’re looking into how it reacts with omicron.

Another important element is that these recombinant vaccines are very stable when produced, one can store them in normal refrigeration systems for a long time, unlike other drugs that expire quickly. We, for example, have had other vaccines stored for more than five years and they work perfectly.

Could this project boost the establishment of manufacturing operations in poor countries in Latin America and Africa?

Of course, that is our main interest. Many regions would benefit from learning about this vaccine development ecosystem to move away from technology dependency. Our Latin American countries, for example, always have to wait for someone to solve their problems, but this is an opportunity to begin to have regional self-sufficiency.

Right now, everyone wants to produce vaccines, but we have to see which are the best models, and what lessons are needed. The intention is to create a balanced ecosystem that not only gives priority to what the multinationals develop, but that also benefits, from an economic and scientific point of view, small local producers in developing countries who are in the process of developing [medicines or vaccines].

What would the process be like for this vaccine to be available in the United States, Europe and Latin America?

We have received thousands of emails from people interested in trying it because it is a more conventional technology and they trust the time we invested in its development. But, in the case of the United States and Europe, it will depend on getting allies who are interested in starting the process.

Another option is for the U.S. government to support us by buying doses from Biological E and donating them to countries that need them so much. And, although we are in talks with various Latin American countries, we are also working to obtain global approval that the World Health Organization can give, so that nations could receive our vaccine through the COVAX mechanism or the PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) Revolving Fund.

What is your team’s next project?

Right now, we are working on a concept of a universal vaccine because we are concerned that, while we are vaccinated, the virus will continue to mutate. Omicron will end, but new variants will come. We do not know what other coronaviruses could emerge in the coming years; we have already seen that every five or 10 years, one appears. That’s why we have to keep investigating.

Do you have any message for Latin American girls who dream of becoming scientists?

My message is that it can be done, no matter what negative people say. Obviously it requires a lot of discipline and studies, first at school and then at university. I believe that having the opportunity to enter a university is essential in our countries.

I studied in Honduras, so it’s a lie that one always has to be educated in high-income countries. Our education, if you do your part and dedicate yourself, can achieve the excellence of the highest educational systems and we can learn what is needed.

Have you felt any type of discrimination during your work as a scientist?

I think it is essential to get rid of that impostor syndrome mentality. One always has that idea that since you are a woman and you come from studying in Latin American countries or spaces, you cannot compete to seek opportunities outside the country, but you can.

It is necessary to create an ecosystem of mentors, of people who recommend you and suggest options. That opens doors and opportunities, not only for studies, but also for work.

On many occasions, scientists are often criticized for not knowing how to convey the importance of their projects. What are your thoughts on this?

I studied to be a scientist, I am a microbiologist, but isolated microbiology is not enough. One has to be able to converse, participate and collaborate with many disciplines such as economics, engineering, mathematics and, of course, health sciences, because everything is needed.

It is not that you have to be a specialist in everything, but you must have that capacity, that intellectual flexibility to be able to have a conversation with different disciplines. I think that is something fundamental. One can focus scientifically on one aspect, but being able to explain it in an accessible language for the population that knows nothing about science is something very important.

After so many years of work and study, what does it mean to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize?

It means that with dedication and passion, and always maintaining our convictions, much can be achieved. We can help solve many global problems that we have around the world, especially inequity in health systems.

2022-01-28 08:00:10+00:00,6,"WASHINGTON — The federal Department of Health and Human Services is failing to meet its responsibilities for leading the nation’s response to public health emergencies including the coronavirus pandemic, extreme weather disasters and even potential bioterror attacks, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog said in a sobering report Thursday.

The Government Accountability Office said it is designating HHS’ leadership and coordination of public health emergencies as a “high risk” area for the government. Such a “high risk” designation from the GAO carries no immediate penalties for an agency, but it signals to Congress that lawmakers need to pay special attention to that agency’s operations to avoid future debacles.

Longstanding “persistent deficiencies” at HHS “have hindered the nation’s response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and a variety of past threats,” the GAO said in its report. ""If left unaddressed, these deficiencies will continue to hamper the nation’s ability to be prepared for, and effectively respond to, future threats.""

The shortfalls include managing the medical supply chain, coordinating with federal and state agencies and providing clear and consistent communication to the public and the health care community, the GAO said.

The report, part of the GAO’s ongoing evaluation of the government’s pandemic response, comes as leading senators of both parties released draft legislation this week calling for a close study of the pandemic and an overhaul of HHS capabilities. Among the lawmakers' priorities are closer congressional oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an HHS agency, building out the supply chain and improving coordination from the top rungs of HHS. Some of those address issues raised by the GAO report.

“Waiting to address the deficiencies we have identified in HHS’s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies is not an option as it is not possible to know precisely when the next threat will occur; only that it will come,” the GAO said.

The report did not assign blame to individual officials, in the current or past administrations.

HHS spokesperson Sarah Lovenheim said in a statement that “we’re in a much stronger position than we were a year ago.” Lovenheim added: “We look forward to reading GAO’s feedback on these important issues and sharing progress in this whole-of-government effort as we continue to work to ensure the American people are protected from future health-related emergencies.”

Last year, the White House had issued a plan for updating the U.S. pandemic response, but it was not couched in terms of fixing serious shortcomings. Instead, it called for improving U.S. public health capabilities to put them on par with the nation's military defense response.

Under both the Biden and the Trump administrations, HHS has taken a backseat to the White House in management of the coronavirus pandemic even though its scientists, doctors, disease detectives and service providers carry out most of the day-to-day work.

The GAO said it found “persistent deficiencies” in five main areas for HHS: establishing clear roles and responsibilities for federal, state and local agencies; collecting and analyzing data to inform decision-makers; providing clear and consistent communication to the public; establishing transparency and accountability; and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of other federal and state agencies that it has to work with.

For example, under the heading of setting clear roles and responsibilities, the GAO said that the health agency still has not addressed recommendations from 2020 for resolving supply chain issues, including the availability of diagnostic tests. “Shortages of such supplies continue to plague the nation’s pandemic response,” the report said.

Ramping up production of at-home Covid-19 tests has become a top priority for the White House in recent weeks.

The GAO concluded that data collection and analysis has been a critical weakness for the federal government since the start of the pandemic. As a result, decision-makers have had only a partial or late-evolving view of some developments. As far back as 2010, Congress had required HHS to put in place a nationwide “public health situational awareness” surveillance system. But more than 10 years later that still has not been done, the GAO said, forcing policymakers to rely on data collected by thousands of state health departments and labs, and multiple federal agencies, with different capabilities and protocols for handling information.

The watchdog agency also found a pattern of “unclear and inconsistent communications” from HHS and its agencies in the context of public health emergencies, not only with regular citizens but with counterpart state and federal agencies.

During the Covid-19 pandemic many Americans have been befuddled by shifting guidance from the CDC as to what they can do to protect themselves and people they interact with. “The American people have stopped listening to the CDC because of their confusing and conflicting guidance — justifiably so,” Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said this week in releasing bipartisan legislation to overhaul the government's pandemic response.

The other two main areas of criticism, dealing with transparency and HHS working relationships with other federal and state agencies, pointed out problems that the GAO said have repeated themselves over the years, predating the coronavirus pandemic and carrying over to the present.

The potential cost of overhauling U.S. capabilities to deal with public health emergencies is unclear. By comparison, the government spends $20 billion a year on missile defense and $170 billion on preventing terrorism, according to White House estimates. The investment in public health preparedness would certainly be less than the cost of dealing with a pandemic once it's out of control.

Burr's counterpart in the Senate legislation, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said this week that “the pain of this pandemic is unforgettable, and we have a responsibility to make sure its lessons are unforgettable, too.""",MSNBC,"['gao', 'watchdog', 'failing', 'health', 'key', 'federal', 'hhs', 'response', 'pandemic', 'crises', 'state', 'agencies', 'public', 'agency', 'report']",0
2022-01-26 23:03:07+00:00,34,"Moderna has begun dosing patients in a clinical trial testing its omicron-specific Covid-19 vaccine booster, the company announced Wednesday.

The Phase 2 study — Moderna's first trial using the omicron-specific vaccine in humans — will assess the safety, tolerability and immune response generated by the shot in adults.

Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic

Lab data from Moderna, as well as studies released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show the drugmaker’s existing booster shot still provides protection against the new variant, especially against severe illness.

But Moderna said new data, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, show about a sixfold drop in the ability of the antibodies to neutralize the omicron variant, compared with the original strain, six months after the booster.

The company's announcement comes a day after Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they started a clinical trial testing their own modified vaccine targeting the omicron variant.

The extremely contagious variant now accounts for virtually all new cases of Covid in the United States, according to the CDC.

Moderna is enrolling two groups in its clinical trial: People who received two doses of its vaccine at least six months ago, and people who received two doses plus a booster shot at least three months ago.

The company said it expects to enroll approximately 300 participants into each arm of the trial, which will be conducted at up to 24 sites in the U.S.

Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Moderna's trial will allow scientists to know how much of a benefit there is in training the immune system to attack the new variant.

""The decline in neutralizing antibodies against omicron that they report six months post booster is enough to allow the virus to start an infection, but the immune response is still strong enough to handle it pretty well in the great majority of people,"" he said.

Moderna has previously said it is in discussions with public health leaders about potentially distributing an omicron-based booster in the fall.

2022-01-26 20:03:05+00:00,30,"For nearly a year, opponents of Covid-19 vaccine requirements have faced an awkward question for which there is no obvious answer: If vaccine mandates are so outrageous, why have they been common in the United States for generations?

Indeed, The New York Times explained last summer that vaccination mandates ""are an American tradition,"" with roots that predate the United States itself. These policies are especially common in schools nationwide, where children are required to receive all kinds of vaccinations before they can attend classes.

As we've discussed, the result is an unresolved inconsistency for those fighting tooth and nail against Covid-19 vaccine requirements: If modern society already has plenty of vaccine mandates, and they're widely seen as uncontroversial, what's wrong with defeating a deadly pandemic with one more?

To resolve the incongruity, opponents of Covid-19 vaccine requirements have two choices: They can accept the effective policies, or they can start pushing back against mandates that predate the current crisis. As a Washington Post analysis noted late yesterday, we're starting to see some actual proposals pushing the latter approach.

In Georgia, a GOP state senator proposed a bill that would ban the state from requiring ""proof of any vaccination of any person as a condition of providing any service or access to any facility."" The bill was endorsed by 17 state senators, about half of the Republican contingent.... Efforts by Republicans in Wisconsin also have shown some real momentum. State Senate Health Committee Chairman Patrick Testin (R) held a hearing this month that included Senate Bill 336. The bill would, among other things, prohibit schools and universities from excluding students because of their vaccination status. And, again, it's not just about coronavirus vaccines.

The article added that Iowa Republicans are also ""pushing forward on related ideas.""

To be sure, this isn't entirely new. Last summer, for example, Republican state Sen. Manny Diaz, who leads a health care committee in Florida's legislature, said the state may ""review"" mandate policies for other non-Covid vaccines. Diaz later walked back his comment.

Soon after, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan argued that his home state of Ohio ""should ban all vaccine mandates.""

I soon after checked the Ohio Department of Health's website, which offered an ""immunization summary for school attendance."" It's not an especially short list: Before children can attend schools in Ohio, they must be fully immunized against, among other things, polio, measles, hepatitis B, chickenpox, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.

The policy has existed for years and it's proven effective. But Jordan apparently endorsed a ban on ""all vaccine mandates"" — because whether these requirements work well in preventing the spread of serious illnesses is less important than whether these requirements are ideologically satisfying.

Three months later, it appears there are actual legislative proposals along these lines taking shape in some states.

In October, NBC News' Benjy Sarlin noted that it seems likely that the United States will ""end up with fewer vaccine requirements in some places than we started with before the pandemic"" that's killed over 870,000 people.

That may sound like madness, but it's also painfully realistic.",MSNBC,"['wont', 'bill', 'republican', 'covid19', 'states', 'schools', 'stop', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'opponents', 'state', 'requirements', 'mandates', 'united', 'vaccination']",0
2022-01-26 03:16:05+00:00,35,"An appeals judge restored New York’s mask mandate Tuesday, a day after a judge in a lower court ruled that Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration lacked the constitutional authority to order people to wear face coverings during the Covid-19 pandemic.

After hearing brief arguments, Appellate Division Justice Robert Miller granted the state’s request to keep the masking rule in place while the governor’s administration pursues an appeal.

He offered no opinion on the mandate’s legality.

The stay came after a day of confusion, in which some New York school districts — particularly in areas that lean Republican — rushed to make masks optional for students and teachers, and state education officials told administrators they should continue enforcing the mask mandate.

Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said her office would continue defending the mandate in court.

“Nearly three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that wearing a mask saves lives. This mandate and today’s decision are critical in helping to stop the spread of this virus and protect individuals young and old,” James said.

At issue is the legality of an order the state’s health commissioner issued in mid-December as the omicron variant fueled a huge wave of Covid-19 infections in the state.

The order required masks in schools, health care facilities, homeless shelters, jails, public transportation, and in any indoor public area where vaccination wasn’t required for entry.

As of now, the statewide mandate is only set to be in place until Feb. 1.

Ruling Monday in a case brought by a group of parents, a judge on Long Island, Thomas Rademaker said the governor and state health commissioner didn’t have authority to issue such a mandate without legislative approval.

The mandate “is a law that was promulgated and enacted unlawfully by an executive branch state agency, and therefore void and unenforceable,” the judge said.

As school districts waited for the legal questions to play out, parents received mixed instructions, depending on where they live.

In the Massapequa School District, on Long Island, administrators immediately made masking optional.

“While it is certain this decision will face legal challenges, until otherwise litigated, mask wearing will be optional for students and staff in the Massapequa Schools beginning Tuesday,” the district said on its website.

Syracuse City Schools were among those the stuck with the state guidance. “That means that anyone entering any of our schools must continue to wear a mask,” a notice on the district’s website said. New York City also stuck with its masking rule, which pre-existed the state’s order.

In Westchester County, Mamaroneck Superintendent Robert Shaps made mask-wearing optional.

Republican U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik criticized Hochul for “ignoring” the lower court’s ruling. She told parents in her northern New York congressional district to call her office if their children were not allowed in school without a mask.

“Masks are not mandatory for students, period. Yet Kathy Hochul is still trying to force young children to wear a mask in school, shamefully disregarding the rule of law,” Stefanik said in a news release issued before the appeals court acted.

Nothing in Rademaker’s ruling had barred school districts from adopting masking rules on their own.

Arguing before Miller on Tuesday, Judith Vale, an attorney for the state, said that if Rademaker’s ruling were left it place it would endanger people’s health.

“The order, if not stayed will allow individuals to refuse to wear face coverings in indoor public settings where the risk of COVID-19 spread is high, including in schools where many children remain unvaccinated against COVID-19,” the state said in a court filing.

Attorney Chad Laveglia, who brought the challenge on behalf of a group of parents, vowed to take it “as far as it needs to go.”

“The judge got it wrong entirely,” he said of Miller’s decision to put Rademaker’s on hold until the appeals court has a chance to hear more detailed arguments.

Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt criticized Hochul for relying on mandates and said she should instead send a bill to the Legislature for debate.

“We are two years into this pandemic, and it’s absurd that this administration is still ruling by mandates — which continue to cause confusion, frustration and division among New Yorkers,” he said.

The legal fight comes as the omicron wave that gripped New York state has been easing. The state averaged just under 22,000 new cases of the virus per day in the seven-day period that ended Monday, down from 74,600 per day during the wave’s peak in early January. Hospitalizations are dropping, too, declining 17 percent statewide in the past seven days.

New York State United Teachers President Andy Pallotta cited current public health guidance that favored masks at a time of elevated infection rates.

“In the meantime, we’re looking to state health officials to set a clear off-ramp for when mask requirements in schools can be relaxed,” Pallotta said, “so students, families and educators have some certainty that there is light at the end of this long tunnel.”",MSNBC,"['judge', 'court', 'york', 'covid19', 'schools', 'health', 'restores', 'school', 'mandate', 'temporarily', 'state', 'wear', 'mask', 'yorks', 'appeals']",0

The drugmakers said they aim to enroll up to 1,420 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 in the trial, which will evaluate whether the omicron-specific vaccine is safe and generates a strong immune response.

Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic

The participants will be divided into three groups — fully vaccinated, fully vaccinated and boosted, and unvaccinated — which will determine whether they receive one, two or three doses of the modified vaccine.

The companies also said they expect to launch a similar study in the U.S. testing the shot in those older than 55.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new research Friday that found that a booster shot of the current vaccines provides robust protection against severe illness from the rapidly spreading variant, which accounts for virtually all new cases in the U.S.

The CDC studies also suggested that existing boosters offered “significant protection” against both infection and symptomatic illness, although the protection was higher during the delta surge compared to the omicron surge.

While the existing vaccines can protect people against some of the worst outcomes of Covid, drugmakers have said they would continue to develop variant-specific shots in case they are needed.

John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, said the modified shots could become important in a ""worst-case scenario"" in which the omicron variant mutates to become as lethal as the delta variant.

""That scenario is not impossible,"" he said. ""If it happens, the new variant would kill a lot of vaccinated people and change the face of the pandemic for the worse.""

In other words, the new trial could be seen as ""an insurance policy,"" he said.

Moore added that by the time the results from the trial are in, public health officials and outside experts should know more about the trajectory of the pandemic.

Will omicron remain the dominant variant, or will it become a minor contributor to the overall pandemic? Will another variant more closely related to the ones that appeared last year emerge?

""We may not know that answer any time soon, but in the end it’s relevant to whether and how an omicron-based vaccine will be useful,"" he said.

2022-01-25 02:46:05+00:00,84,"Aaron Rodgers, the outspoken quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, had a statistically marvelous season.

In December, he threw his 443rd touchdown, passing Brett Favre to become the Packers’ all-time record holder. He also became the first player in the team's history to be named to 10 Pro Bowls. In all, his 37 touchdowns this season and only four interceptions are enough to make him the presumptive favorite to win MVP at his ripe age of 38.

Rodgers, previously seen as a sober thinker despite some occasional aloofness, has reduced himself to a real-life internet troll.

But Rodgers had a humiliating season, regardless — and not just because he mustered a pedestrian 225 passing yards in his final performance, a 13-10 playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers. When we look back on his year, everything Rodgers did on the field will be overshadowed by his selfish flouting of Covid-19 safety measures, his arrogant political rants and his exhausting victim mentality.

A rehash, shall we?

Rodgers was sidelined after testing positive for Covid on Nov. 3. Since the NFL has allowed Covid-positive players to continue playing if they’ve been vaccinated, Rodgers’ absence was a clear sign he hadn’t received the shots. This surprised many, since he’d previously — and evasively — claimed he’d been “immunized” against the virus. Then, after being called out for being deceitful, he accused a “woke mob” of trying to “cancel” him. Doctors be damned, in Rodgers’ view, he knows who the true “experts” are.

Or so he thinks.

Rodgers said he got tips on beating the virus from Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who has become a key source of Covid-related misinformation online. Rodgers later issued a half-hearted apology “to anybody who felt misled” by his deliberately misleading claim that he’d been immunized. “I take full responsibility"" for those comments, he said — whatever that means.

Then, in late November, Rodgers invited more controversy when he said on Pat McAfee’s podcast that he was suffering from “Covid toe,” a painful symptom causing severe soreness. He later claimed he was joking, and he slammed media outlets that reported his own words as fact.

He called it “disinformation,” evidently disregarding the fact he was the one who shared it.

Rodgers leaned in to his status as an up-and-coming conservative icon earlier this month when he touted Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” in a national interview. The book is essentially required reading for many conservatives.

He’s suffered a moral defeat this year, and he’s hemorrhaged much of the respect many people have had for him.

In a recent ESPN interview, Rodgers suggested he mentioned the book — you guessed it — as a kind of joke. But he showed his true colors as that interview went on, revealing he's bought in to more right-wing conspiracies. At one point, he criticized President Joe Biden’s “fake White House” for its messaging on Covid safety, and he questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

“When the president of the United States says, ‘This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,’ it’s because him and his constituents, which, I don’t know how there are any if you watch any of his attempts at public speaking, but I guess he got 81 million votes,” he told ESPN.

And that’s the sad part, really. Rodgers, previously seen as a sober thinker despite some occasional aloofness, has reduced himself to a real-life internet troll. He’s found an odd joy in being a contrarian, and seemingly even more joy in playing the victim when his lies and misstatements have been called out. He’s suffered a moral defeat this year, and he’s hemorrhaged much of the respect many people have had for him.

In my view, that’s more humiliating than whimpering off the field after throwing zero touchdowns in a playoff duel against the 49ers' Jimmy Garoppolo.

2022-01-13 23:46:06+00:00,98,"The contradiction is unsubtle. On the one hand, Republicans insist that President Joe Biden and his administration contain the Covid-19 crisis and end the pandemic. On the other hand, many of those same Republicans are too often relentless in trying to prevent the White House from doing exactly that.

It's a multifaceted strategy that includes trying to gut the Biden administration's vaccine policies, filing lawsuits to block implementation of Biden's policies, and in some red states, effectively paying people not to get vaccinated. At the same time, many Republicans are undermining public confidence in vaccines and mask protections, while promoting ineffective treatments and dangerous ideas about ""natural immunity.""

And then, of course, there are the Republican-appointed justices on the Supreme Court taking a side. NBC News reported this afternoon:

The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration's rule requiring larger businesses to ensure that workers receive the Covid vaccine or wear masks and get tested on a weekly basis.... The workplace rule, announced last fall by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, required companies with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workers either get vaccinated or wear masks and show negative Covid test results at least once a week.

By most standards, this was less controversial than the right made it out to be. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for, among other things, creating workplace safeguards to ensure workers don't get hurt on the job.

As far as the White House was concerned, if OSHA can require construction workers to wear hard hats to prevent serious injuries, the agency has the same authority to require vaccinations for the same reason. Legal experts generally assumed the administration's position would prevail.

It didn't. In their 6-3 ruling, the Republican-appointed justices concluded that the viral contagion that's killed nearly 850,000 Americans is not really an ""occupational hazard,"" since people can contract the virus outside of workplaces.

Of course, by that reasoning, workplaces with asbestos don't necessarily create occupational hazards, either, since people might also be exposed asbestos elsewhere.

As NBC News' report added, the three center-left justices dissented, concluded that OSHA was well within its authority and expertise to impose the mandates, unlike the court.

""Underlying everything else in this dispute is a single, simple question: Who decides how much protection, and of what kind, American workers need from COVID–19?"" the dissenters asked. ""An agency with expertise in workplace health and safety, acting as Congress and the President authorized? Or a court, lacking any knowledge of how to safeguard workplaces, and insulated from responsibility for any damage it causes?""

The trio argued, ""Acting outside of its competence and without legal basis, the Court displaces the judgments of the Government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies.""

They added, ""In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed,"" the justices wrote. ""As disease and death continue to mount, this court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible. Without legal basis, the court usurps a decision that rightfully belongs to others. It undercuts the capacity of the responsible federal officials, acting well within the scope of their authority, to protect American workers from grave danger.""

The OSHA policy would've covered nearly 80 million American workers, and by the administration's estimates, the rule was poised to save over 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations in the next six months.

Thanks to the increasingly radicalized high court, that policy no longer exists. It will almost certainly extend the duration of the public health crisis.

That said, today was not a total loss for public health advocates. In a separate ruling, the Supreme Court said the administration's mandate requiring vaccinations for an estimated 20 million health care workers can be enforced.

This was a 5-4 ruling, with Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett dissenting.

The fact that there were four justices who were prepared to block this policy, too, is a reminder of just how far to the right much of the court has gone.",MSNBC,"['workplace', 'court', 'policy', 'agency', 'undermine', 'administrations', 'health', 'osha', 'justices', 'occupational', 'bidens', 'safety', 'supreme', 'vaccine', 'workers', 'conservatives']",0

The latest twists in the tennis star's visa saga came as government officials continued to mull whether to deport him from the country before next week's Australian Open.

Djokovic, 34, made the admissions in an Instagram post as he sought to address what he called “continuing misinformation” about his movements after he tested positive on Dec. 16, a result his lawyers said gave him grounds for a medical exemption to enter Australia and compete in the tournament despite being unvaccinated.

His exemption was rejected and visa revoked, with the Serbian star held in immigration detention before a judge ordered his release earlier this week. The furor has shaken the tennis world and added fuel to the global debate over Covid-19 vaccination mandates.

In his post, Djokovic said he attended a basketball game in Belgrade on Dec. 14 which spurred a number of positive Covid-19 tests. So despite having no symptoms, Djokovic said, he took a rapid antigen test on Dec. 16, which came back negative. But out of an “abundance of caution,” he also took a PCR test the same day.

Before it came back positive, he said he attended a tennis event in the Serbian capital to present awards to children the next day.

After getting his positive result on Dec. 17, Djokovic said he canceled all his commitments except for a long-standing interview and photo shoot with French sports newspaper L’Equipe.

“I felt obligated to go ahead ... but did ensure I socially distanced and wore a mask except when my photograph was being taken,” the tennis star added. “While I went home after the interview to isolate for the required period, on reflection, this was an error of judgment.”

Djokovic also blamed “human error” by his support team for a mistake on his travel declaration form to get into Australia.

On the form, Djokovic said he had not traveled in the 14 days before his flight to Australia, despite being seen in Spain and Serbia in that two-week period.

The tennis star said the error was ""certainly not deliberate.”

“My agent sincerely apologizes for the administrative mistake in ticking the incorrect box,” he added in his post.

Djokovic sought to clarify his actions after a slew of media reports scrutinizing his travel documents and movements before getting into Australia.

The saga has left many Australians outraged, with the omicron variant driving a fresh wave of cases in the country after months of severe limits on the public's movement and travel restrictions that kept many families apart.

The world No. 1 held another practice session in Melbourne on Wednesday, but it's still not clear if he will be able to remain in the country to play in next week's Australian Open. The draw for the tournament is set to take place on Thursday.

Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke still has the power to, once again, cancel Djokovic’s visa and deport him. His office confirmed to NBC News Tuesday that the minister is “considering” the move under a section of the country’s Migration Act.

The Australian Border Force declined to comment on whether it was investigating Djokovic’s travel declaration discrepancies and movements before his arrival in the country, but added that providing false or misleading information or documentation can lead to visa cancellation.

The tennis star said his team provided additional information to the Australian government on Wednesday “to clarify this matter.”

2022-01-12 18:33:06+00:00,28,"The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it would provide schools with 10 million Covid-19 tests every month as it urges districts to keep classrooms open amid a widespread shortage of testing kits.

The White House said it would distribute 5 million rapid tests to schools every month as well as make an additional 5 million PCR tests available through a Department of Health and Human Services program that collects samples and sends them to labs.

""The president is clear: The nation's schools can and should be open. And we have given state and local leaders the resources to ensure they can be open,"" White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients said at the administration Covid briefing.

Students are returning from winter break and case numbers are surging across the country, fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus. The spike in cases has created disruptions in many school systems. Some started 2022 by switching to remote learning or delaying openings.

The testing push in schools comes as the country is seeing an unprecedented rise in infections that risks overwhelming the nation's already stretched hospitals, said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. While data suggests people are less likely to get severely ill from omicron, especially if they are vaccinated, Walensky said the sheer number of cases is driving up hospitalizations, which rose 33 percent in the last week.

""The sudden and steep rise in cases due to omicron is resulting in unprecedented daily case counts, sickness, absenteeism, and strains on our health care system,"" Walensky said. ""The risk of hospitalization remains low, especially among people who are up to date on their Covid vaccines. However, the staggering rise in cases, over 1 million new cases each day, has led to a high number of total hospitalizations.""

The surge in cases has left some schools without enough staff, and others struggling to get enough tests.

Chicago’s public schools canceled classes for four days after the teachers union voted to go remote, in part over disputes involving Covid testing. The union and the school district reached a deal this week that will return students to classrooms on Wednesday.

In Clark County, Nevada, which covers Las Vegas, the school district announced a “five-day pause” Tuesday, citing “extreme staffing shortages"" based on the high number of positive Covid cases.

The Biden administration said Wednesday that efforts to run federal surge testing sites in hard-hit areas will also now look at how the programs can support schools.

Testing capacity has been strained in areas hit hardest by the omicron wave, with some patients standing in lines for hours to get a laboratory test, then waiting days for the results. Rapid at-home tests have been in high demand, with many retailers saying they can't keep them in stock.

The White House said Wednesday that it has brought on a new testing czar in recent weeks, Tom Inglesby, who was director of Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, to work on improving access to testing.

The White House said the Education Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will help support schools that want to set up testing programs, including how to gain access to federal funds.

The White House recently said it would buy 500 million at-home tests to be mailed to people, who could request them through a government-run website. Last week, the administration said it had finalized its first contracts related to those tests.

More recently, the administration said it would mandate that insurance companies and group health plans cover the cost of eight counter at-home tests per person each month starting Saturday.

Kellyanne Conway, a prominent White House official, argued at the time that this was a justifiable position because she knew of some people who waited in lines for baked goods.

There were a great many problems with the argument, but one specific flaw was of particular interest: Conway didn't contest the fact that she and her party preferred an electoral system in which it was more difficult for Americans to participate in their own democracy.

The shift, set to take effect Jan. 15, comes as the omicron variant continues surging across the country and the administration tries to boost access to the hard-to-find tests.

Under the new rules, insurers will have to cover eight tests per person per month, the Health and Human Services Administration said in a release.

Eligible tests need to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they will not be subject to deductibles or other cost-sharing requirements, the department said.

The administration will “incentivize” the companies to allow people to get the tests with no out-of-pocket costs through “preferred” pharmacies and retailers, according to the release.

In a statement, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the move was “part of our overall strategy to ramp up access to easy-to-use, at-home tests at no cost.”

Monday’s announcement comes nearly one week after retailers that had been selling Abbott’s popular at home-test said that they were hiking its price after a three-month agreement with the administration to sell them at cost expired.

In a separate effort, the White House said last week that it was finalizing details in a plan to ship 500 million free at-home tests to all Americans.

Two contracts were finalized with companies in Virginia and California to send the tests via the United States Postal Service. One of the contracts totaled 13.3 million tests, though it wasn’t clear how many tests the other agreement would cover.

2022-01-10 07:25:06+00:00,12,"Tennis star Novak Djokovic said Monday he plans to stay in Australia to ""try to compete"" in the Australian Open after winning an appeal against a decision to cancel his visa over his Covid-19 vaccination status.

In a ruling early Monday, Federal Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly ordered that Djokovic be released from immigration detention and have his visa reinstated.

However, the saga — which became a flashpoint in the broader debate over vaccine mandates — may not be over as Australia’s immigration minister weighs whether to use his personal power to cancel the athlete’s visa again.

""I'm pleased and grateful that the Judge overturned my visa cancellation. Despite all that has happened, I want to stay and try to compete @AustralianOpen,"" Djokovic, 34, said in a tweet.

""I remain focused on that. I flew here to play at one of the most important events we have in front of the amazing fans,"" he said.

""For now I cannot say more but THANK YOU all for standing with me through all this and encouraging me to stay strong,"" he said in a second tweet.

The Serbian tennis star made the comments as his family held a news conference in his support and said he had already returned to the practice court to prepare for the tournament later this month.

“We have come to celebrate the victory of our son, Novak. A boy who learned in his family not to tolerate lies, injustice and deception and always fought for justice,"" said Djokovic's mother, Dijana, at the event in the Serbian capital Belgrade.

She said his win in court was the ""biggest victory in his career, bigger than all his grand slams.”

Djokovic’s brother, Djordje, said he believed his sibling was fighting for the “liberty of choice.”

The battle waged by the men’s world No. 1 came after fury in Australia, which is battling a new wave of infections driven by the omicron variant, over Djokovic’s claim of a vaccine exemption allowing him to compete in this month’s tournament.

The tennis star has drawn fierce support from his native Serbia, and from protesters who expressed their backing outside the hotel in which he was held over the weekend.

But while his fight became a rallying point for many opposed to restrictions on the unvaccinated, others saw the furor as the latest incident to undermine the credentials of a sporting great who has drawn frequent criticism for his behavior on and off the court.

The court order in Djokovic's favor centered largely on how the government handled the cancellation of his visa, however.

During a virtual hearing early Monday the judge noted that the decision was made by a delegate for the home affairs minister at 7:42 a.m. on Thursday, even though Djokovic had been told he would have more time to respond to the notification that his visa was at risk of being canceled.

""If the applicant had had until 8:30 a.m., he could have consulted others and made submissions to the delegate about why his visa should not be canceled,"" Kelly said in reading out an agreement between the government and Djokovic’s lawyers.

During the news conference, Djordje Djokovic praised Kelly for his decision and said he admired the judge.

""I think it was very detailed,"" he said of the decision. ""It was very thorough and it was very neutral and I want to thank him.""

The tennis star was hoping to defend his title at the season’s first major tournament, and his participation is now again possible when it starts on Jan. 17. But the government says the immigration minister could still use his personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa again.

In a statement Monday, a spokesperson for Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said the minister was considering the move.

“Following today’s Federal Circuit and Family Court determination on a procedural ground, it remains within (Hawke's) discretion to consider cancelling Mr Djokovic’s visa under his personal power of cancellation within section 133C(3) of the Migration Act,” the spokesman said, according to Reuters. “The Minister is currently considering the matter and the process remains ongoing.""

The saga began when Djokovic announced on Instagram last Tuesday that he had been granted ""an exemption permission"" for the Covid-19 vaccination, which would allow him to fly to Australia to take part in the tournament.

While he was in the air, questions were raised about exactly how and why Djokovic was granted the apparent exemption amid a worsening epidemic situation in Australia. The country’s total coronavirus infections surpassed 1 million on Monday, with more than half of them recorded in the past week, Reuters reported.

Australia’s Covid-19 rules stipulate that incoming travelers must have had two shots of an approved vaccine, or must have an exemption with a genuine medical reason to avoid quarantine. All Australian Open players, staff, officials and fans also need to be fully vaccinated to enter the tournament venue.

Australia has had some of the world’s toughest border restrictions and only started to allow some international travel in November.

Djokovic was detained at the airport in Melbourne overnight after landing late on Wednesday. In an interview with officials, he said he was not vaccinated against Covid-19 but had been granted an exemption because he had contracted — and recovered from — the virus in December.

There was a dispute over whether this was allowed, and officials subsequently canceled Djokovic’s visa, saying he had failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet Australia’s entry requirements.

In a court filing ahead of the hearing on Monday, government lawyers said the Australian government had not given Djokovic an assurance that the medical exemption would be accepted.

At the hearing, Kelly questioned why the home affairs delegate had not accepted Djokovic's medical exemption, which was reviewed by two medical panels.

“The point I’m somewhat agitated about is, 'What more could this man have done?’” the judge said.

If Hawke were to remove Djokovic from Australia, the tennis star would be ineligible to return to the country for three years. That decision could also be appealed.

Djokovic has won nine of his 20 major titles at the Australian Open, and shares the men’s record for most majors with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

The visa drama has rocked the tennis world and also created tensions between Serbia and Australia.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been vocal about Djokovic’s case and said Thursday that “No one is above rules,” and “there are no special cases.”

In Serbia, President Aleksandar Vučić threw national support behind Djokovic, saying in a post on Instagram that “the whole of Serbia is with him.”

At the news conference Monday, Djokovic's father, Srdjan, praised his son as a “mental strongman” and accused those with power of thinking that it was “impossible for a boy like him to be the best in their bourgeois sport.” He did not say exactly who he was referring to.

Srdjan said that his son had received support “from Africa, the Far and Middle East, Russia, China, India, South America.”

“They are all Novak. Everyone is looking at him as the personification of (the) fight for freedom,” he said.

His fans in Australia, many draped in Serbian flags and wearing “Novak” T-shirts, had rallied outside the hotel in Melbourne where Djokovic was kept under guard for several days while awaiting his appeal hearing. The hotel is also used to house refugees and asylum seekers, some of whom have been there for years.

Djokovic's mother said her son’s detention had left her family with feelings of “sadness, despair (and) disappointment.”

“There were moments when he didn’t even have a phone and we didn’t know what was happening,” she said. “We didn’t know if he was okay or if everything was fine with him. If he ate, if he was hungry. These are things that I, as a mother, cannot just get over and I think that all mothers in the world will understand me.”

Previously, the family had accused the Australian government of holding him “prisoner” at the hotel, but the country’s authorities rejected those claims and said the player was free to leave Australia at any time.

2022-01-10 06:03:04+00:00,182,"Twitter suspended a personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., for ""repeated violations"" of its Covid misinformation policy, the company said Sunday.

""We permanently suspended the account you referenced (@mtgreenee) for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,"" Twitter said in a statement. ""We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy.""

Greene appears to still have access to her professional account, @RepMTG. Twitter did not say what was tweeted to earn what it calls a permanent suspension.

Greene said in a statement through her office Sunday that she was suspended for tweeting statistics from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Anyone can report an adverse event to the system, which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency says it is ""not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem.""

""Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth,"" Greene said. ""That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies.""

Twitter implemented a strike system for violations in March. A single strike might not incur an action, but the company will place locks on accounts that repeatedly violate the policy.

Five or more strikes result in a ""permanent suspension,"" according to the company's website. Greene was suspended multiple times last year for violations of the policies.

In January last year, Greene was suspended for making false claims about widespread voter fraud in Georgia. She was also suspended in July and August for violating the Covid-19 policy with tweets about vaccines.

Greene’s suspension is not the first time Twitter has banned an elected official. Last year, it issued a similar action against then-President Donald Trump because of “severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy.""

Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal told CNBC in February that Twitter would uphold the ban even if Trump runs for office again.

2022-01-09 10:07:03+00:00,69,"Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new numbers suggesting that 1 in 44 children in the United States are autistic. This is cause for celebration. As CDC researcher Kelly Shaw noted, the “the earlier kids get identified, the earlier they can access services that they might need to improve their developmental outcome.” Similarly, higher prevalence rates reported among Black and Hispanic children is also good news given America’s poor track record diagnosing autistic children of color. Better diagnoses mean more children will receive the services they need. But more than that, it’s time for a cultural reckoning. Autism affects people from all walks of life — and it’s time we embrace them all equally.

Oz’s ascent (and that he could be a U.S. senator come 2023) is just one example of how the world we live in has been shaped by years of autism fearmongering.

Unfortunately, last week also featured Dr. Mehmet Oz, the erstwhile esteemed cardiothoracic surgeon-turned-snake oil salesman, announcing his candidacy for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in Pennsylvania. Oz has spent a career selling ludicrous weight-loss supplements, but he’s also spent a significant amount of time providing a platform for people who misunderstand and fear autism.

Oz’s ascent (and that he could be a U.S. senator come 2023) is just one example of how the world we live in has been shaped by years of autism fearmongering. That culture of fear which by extension includes vaccines has profoundly dangerous ripple effects. Indeed, many of the people who now question everything from the efficacy of Covid-19 to the integrity of U.S. elections cut their teeth promoting conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods about autism.

As late as 2014, Oz had Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a notorious anti-vaxxer, on his show to talk about removing Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, from flu shots. Apparently unimportant is the fact that the CDC says Thimerosal does not increase the risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This was not the first time Oz had waded into the murky autism and vaccine misinformation pool. He also gave a platform to Jenny McCarthy, America’s ur-anti-vaccine mom (who to this day denies she’s anti-vaccine), who talked about asking God to help “heal” her son (which as a Christian makes me want to yell, “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?”) Incidentally, when I searched the website for Oz’s show, a series of segments he did on autism causes are now unavailable.

Even when Oz got it right, like in 2019 when he featured a mom who exposed parents poisoning their autistic children with bleach, he was often also wrong. “There is no cure right now for autism,” he noted. “I wish there was and I understand the desire of parents who want to help their kids.” This despite that many autistic people do not want to be “cured” but rather, as I chronicled extensively in my book “We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation,” want their autism to be seen and accepted as an inextricable part of their identity.

Perhaps one of the most egregious practitioners of this fearmongering is Kennedy. The former environmental activist’s infamous, 4,700-word opus linking vaccines and autism appeared in Rolling Stone magazine and on Salon.com in 2005, but was eventually retracted because of its many half-truths and falsehoods. Sadly, the damage was done.

These days, Kennedy is hawking a book supposedly exposing the “Real Anthony Fauci,” and collaborating with the conspiratorial John Birch Society, which his father called “ridiculous” when he was U.S. attorney general. The book is now a New York Times bestseller and Eric Clapton, the former guitar god turned anti-vaxxer himself, cried his white boy blues to Kennedy in November. For years, Kennedy has irreparably tarnished his family name with stunts like implying baseball legend Henry Aaron’s death might be linked to the Covid vaccine.

Meanwhile, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the conspiracy-mongering and Islamophobic Republican from Georgia, has tweeted about the “common ground” she finds with the Nation of Islam, specifically noting how the organization opposes the Covid-19 vaccine. Initially surprising, this odd connection makes a lot of sense. Greene’s style of xenophobic and conspiratorial politics is an outgrowth of the tea party movement, which developed a symbiotic relationship with the anti-vaccine movement in the 2010s. Similarly, the Nation of Islam’s opposition to the Covid-19 vaccine is an outgrowth of its anti-vaccine alliance with Kennedy. Conversely, it should be said that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., the target of some of Greene’s worst vitriol, has long worked to improve the Somali community’s trust in vaccinations.

As FiveThirtyEight noted this year, conservatives have long been resistant to mandates for vaccinations. What has changed slightly, notes science journalist Tara Haelle, is their language. After focusing largely on arguments about “toxins,” the anti-vaccine movement is now more focused on arguments about “choice,” a broader rallying cry for the pro-freedom red state crowd. Today, conservatives constantly invoke the language of “choice.” Indeed, conservative Republicans brought the country to the brink of a government shutdown just a few days ago over vaccine mandates.

Perhaps most frightening is the way the anti-vaxx movement has melded with true anti-democratic extremists. About a block away from the Capitol on Jan. 6, anti-vaccine activists held a “MAGA Freedom Rally” that blended anti-vaccine claptrap with lies about the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. Del Bigtree, who produced a documentary lionizing disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield and his now-retracted study linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism, was a featured speaker. During the rally, Bigtree compared Fauci to voting machines, claiming Americans could trust neither. It’s possible that the more cynical anti-vaxxers see election fraud as their next pivot (and meal ticket).

But unlike Covid-19, autism isn’t scary. We shouldn’t fear it, but rather learn to better support those individuals living with it. Sadly, as autism diagnoses increased in the 1990s and the 2000s, solidarity did not keep pace. Instead, anti-vaxxers offered simplistic conspiratorial rationalizations that cast wide and damaging cultural shadows.

Like a tumor, the anti-vaccine movement has metastasized in other parts of the American body politic. Many of the strategies that could help dismantle ableism would also help mitigate the effects of the pandemic: namely community-based care. But these efforts are undermined by anti-vaxxers once again wreaking havoc. Only now, it’s not just autistic people in their crosshairs. It’s all of us.",MSNBC,"['autistic', 'oz', 'americas', 'antivaccine', 'movement', 'children', 'help', 'autism', 'tracing', 'conspiracies', 'kennedy', 'vaccine', 'god', 'covid', 'fearmongering']",0
2022-01-09 08:06:01+00:00,42,"A U.S. District Court judge agreed Thursday to let federal prosecutors use convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's $1,400 Covid-19 stimulus payment, as well as other money held in his inmate trust account, to help pay the millions of dollars he was ordered to pay his victims.

In a filing Wednesday, the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston asked a judge to order the federal Bureau of Prisons to turn the money over to the Clerk of the Court “as payment towards his outstanding criminal monetary penalties, including unpaid special assessment and restitution.”

The Wall Street Journal first reported the judge's decision Thursday.

In addition to the stimulus payment, Tsarnaev, who’s being held at a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, has received money from dozens of sources during his incarceration, including the federal public defender’s office and regular payments from individuals living in Indiana, New Jersey and Maryland, according to the filing by acting U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, Nathaniel Mendell.

As of Dec. 22, Tsarnaev had $3,885 and change in his account.

He was convicted in 2015 of 30 charges in connection with the 2013 bombing at the Boston Marathon finish line that killed three spectators and injured more than 260 others. In 2016 he was ordered to pay a $3,000 special assessment and more than $101 million in criminal restitution.

So far, Tsarnaev has paid a little more than $2,200 of that, all toward the assessment, according to the filing.

And although he has not paid a penny in restitution, Tsarnaev has used his inmate account to pay his siblings for items such as “gifts,” “support,” and “books,” according to the filing.

“The United States submits that the requested relief is reasonable and appropriate in this instance, especially in light of the defendant prioritizing payments to his siblings over the victims of his crimes,” prosecutors wrote.

An email seeking comment was left with Tsarnaev’s attorneys.

Tsarnaev was originally sentenced to death, but the federal appeals court in Boston threw out the death sentence in July 2020 because, it said, the judge at his trial did not do enough to ensure the jury would not be biased against him. He is currently serving a life sentence.

2022-01-09 06:03:01+00:00,97,"Physicians around the country facing the latest surge of Covid-19 cases, driven by the highly contagious omicron variant, have a straightforward message based on what they're seeing in their emergency rooms: Vaccinations and boosters are having a positive effect.

“The general trend that I’m seeing is, if you’re boosted and you get Covid, you really just at worst end up with bad cold symptoms. It’s not like before where you were coughing, couldn’t say sentences and were short of breath,” said Dr. Matthew Bai, an emergency medicine physician at Mount Sinai Queens in New York City.

“There are obviously exceptions like if you start out with a very weakened immune system, your immune response won’t be as strong with a booster. But in your average person, a booster’s definitely going to make a difference is what I’m seeing,” he said.

Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of critical care services and the Covid-19 unit at Houston’s United Memorial Medical Center, said of the roughly 50 patients admitted to the hospital’s Covid unit in the last four weeks, 100 percent of them were unvaccinated.

He said patients who needed to be admitted typically have “shortness of breath, high fevers, being dehydrated like crazy.” He said those who are unvaccinated also “have more illness. What I mean by more illness is more pneumonia, not just a little bit of pneumonia, you have a lot of pneumonia.”

“The people that are coming in unvaccinated have a much larger burden of illness in the lungs than those who are vaccinated,” he said.

Meanwhile, those who had received the booster shot were “almost back to normal” within several days, he said. Those who had not received the booster have tended to “still feel sick after a week, a week and a half or so,” he added.

Patients who have received the booster shot may still have symptoms such as a sore throat, a lot of fatigue and muscle pain, said Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Those who are vaccinated but have not got the booster “looked worse, they looked like they felt pretty darn bad. But, again, they didn’t need to be hospitalized,” he said.

""I’m not seeing people who have got two doses and a booster and are coming in profoundly short of breath,"" he said. ""It’s just not happening.""

Those who are vaccinated but have not got a booster have shown symptoms such as more coughing, more fever and more fatigue than those who had received a booster, he said.

Meanwhile, Spencer said almost every patient he has seen who needed to be admitted was unvaccinated.

“We’ve known that there are multiple presentations of this disease, that hasn’t changed. What has changed is that we know that those who are vaccinated are significantly less likely to end up seeing me in the hospital and needing to be admitted. That’s for certain,” he said.

The new omicron variant continues to spread rapidly in the United States, making up about 58 percent of all new Covid cases for the week ending Dec. 25, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Early evidence suggests that for most people, at least for those who are up to date on their Covid vaccines, omicron appears less likely to cause severe illness.

A small study from the CDC published Tuesday suggested people who had Covid and are later reinfected with omicron may experience fewer symptoms than they did during their initial bout with the virus.

And last week, reports out of the United Kingdom found that people who were infected with omicron in November and December were about two-thirds less likely to be hospitalized, compared with the delta variant.

Physicians still stressed the importance of getting the vaccine and getting a booster, even if omicron appears less likely to lead to severe illness than delta.

“Especially for those that are above 50-55, anyone with underlying medical conditions, we know that it can decrease the likelihood of you needing to be hospitalized with severe Covid,” Spencer said.

For those who are younger or without underlying medical conditions, he said, “if you can prevent infections in younger folks, you can hopefully prevent infections in older folks, their grandparents, their parents or people that they see and mingle with, especially around the holidays.”

“So, I think from an infection prevention and control standpoint, getting a booster dose in younger folks, in addition to the benefit in terms of severe disease, is quite important,” he said.",MSNBC,"['observed', 'wave', 'frontline', 'week', 'symptoms', 'theyve', 'omicron', 'medical', 'seeing', 'latest', 'booster', 'vaccinated', 'received', 'severe', 'workers', 'covid']",0

2022-01-07 16:33:03+00:00,28,"Expectations heading into this morning showed projections of about 440,000 new jobs added in the United States in December. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the preliminary tally suggests the job market was weaker than expected. CNBC reported this morning:

The U.S. economy added far fewer jobs than expected in December just as the nation was grappling with a massive surge in Covid cases, the Labor Department said Friday. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 199,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Like last month, the data seems a little strange. With the unemployment rate improving to its lowest point since before the pandemic, and with wages up, we'd expect to see stronger overall job growth.

What's more, job totals from October and November were both revised up, adding an additional 141,000 previously unreported new jobs — on top of the 199,000 jobs created in December.

With this in mind, as disappointing as it is to see last month's tally fall far short of expectations, it's hard not to wonder whether this initial total will be revised in an encouraging direction a month or two from now. This would certainly be in keeping with the recent trend: Throughout 2021, preliminary jobs reports have dramatically understated actual job growth.

As for the political context, over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump's term — when the then-Republican president said the United States' economy was the greatest in the history of the planet — the economy created roughly 6.5 million jobs. This includes all of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

According to the latest tally, in 2021, the U.S. economy created 6.4 million jobs.

For many years, I ran a chart at the bottom of posts about the monthly jobs reports, but the job losses at the start of the pandemic were so severe, it's rendered the image largely meaningless.

2022-01-07 16:02:03+00:00,53,"Covid-19's omicron variant appears to be affecting children under age 5 in a new way: a harsh, barking cough known as croup.

While croup generally is not harmful, it can be frightening for parents already on edge about their babies and toddlers, too young for the Covid-19 vaccine, becoming infected with the virus.

Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic

Doctors say this is most likely occurring because it appears omicron tends to settle higher up in the respiratory tract, rather than deeper in the lungs.

""Little kids' airways are so narrow that it takes far less inflammation to clog them,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert and director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

When a child with tiny, inflamed airways breathes, it makes a distinctive noise, and can result in a cough that sounds like a dog or a seal.

Creech said that he and his colleagues have noted ""croup-like presentations"" in young children who test positive for Covid-19. The upper part of kids' airways become very swollen. ""When that happens,"" he said, ""there's that characteristic barking cough.""

A number of seasonal viruses, including parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus, can lead to croup and an infection of the respiratory tract called bronchiolitis. Now it seems, Covid-19 — specifically the omicron variant — should be added to that list.

Dr. Saif Al Qatarneh, a pediatric pulmonologist at West Virginia University, said that he, too, has noted an increase in such diagnoses in tandem with a rise in pediatric Covid cases.

Children under age 5 are not eligible for Covid-19 vaccines. CDC

So far, the omicron variant appears to be less severe than the delta variant, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday during a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing.

""But remember the caveat: Rapid community spread is seeing larger numbers of children being hospitalized — again, mostly among the unvaccinated,"" said Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser.

Al Qatarneh said he and his colleagues are concerned about what may occur in the coming weeks as omicron continues to spread.

""We are still two to three weeks away from the peak of omicron,"" he said. ""The smart thought is to get ready for more patients getting bronchiolitis in children and infants.""

A 'bread and butter' diagnosis

One reassuring thought for parents is that croup and bronchiolitis are well-known to doctors, who have had decades of experience treating the conditions.

""Croup is a bread and butter pediatric diagnosis,"" said Dr. Mark Kline, the physician-in-chief at Children’s Hospital New Orleans. ""Infectious croup is one of the first diseases you learn about when you're an intern in pediatrics."" Kline's team, too, has noted the uptick in Covid-related croup.

Dr. Amy Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease expert at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, agreed.

""As pediatricians, seeing more kids with croup and bronchiolitis is oddly reassuring,"" she said, ""because we've been dealing with those conditions for our entire careers.""

Croup can be ""scary to hear, but it doesn't mean there is any problem with the lungs,"" she said. ""The main treatment is to keep the upper airways open and clear until the inflammation subsides.""

Croup may require a few days of steroids, but often goes away on its own. Sometimes kids with bronchiolitis need oxygen support or breathing treatments, Edwards said, before generally recovering completely.

Risk for hospitalization as vaccines lag

Edwards and others want to reassure parents that the vast majority of young children with Covid-19 are likely to have mild illness. But it is possible that some children, even previously healthy ones, can develop serious complications that require hospitalization.

On Friday, the CDC released new data showing that hospitalization rates are increasing among the youngest kids for whom there is no vaccine: ages 0 to 4.

More than 4 in 100,000 children under age 5 were admitted to a hospital with Covid-19 as of January 1, the CDC reported.

What's more an NBC News analysis of Health and Human Services data finds that at least 16 states have broken records for the number of pediatric hospitalizations linked to Covid-19.

Nearly 40 percent of the pediatric hospitalizations at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston include children under 5, said Dr. Jim Versalovic, a pathologist who is a co-leader of the hospital's Covid-19 Command Center.

Vaccines are one of the best ways to protect against infection, but those shots are not expected any time soon for the youngest children.

Vanderbilt's Creech, who is also one of the primary researchers for the Moderna KidCOVE clinical trials, predicted a rollout of vaccines for the youngest children no earlier than this summer. Versalovic of Texas Children's, one of the sites for Pfizer-BioNTech's pediatric clinical trials, also said he did not expect any early childhood vaccines until later this year.

The best defense for unvaccinated children, experts said, is to ""cocoon"" them. That is, surround them with adults and older children who are vaccinated.

""For those who are unvaccinated, this is going to be a rough ride,"" said Creech. ""That may include our young children, and so we really have to protect them as best we can.""

2022-01-07 12:44:03+00:00,36,"Convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hasn't been paying fines or victims with the tens of thousands of dollars deposited into his trust fund, including a Covid-19 relief payment he received in June, federal prosecutors said in a filing Wednesday.

In the filing, prosecutors asked that the approximately $20,000 deposited into Tsarnaev's trust fund be used to pay his outstanding fines.

Tsarnaev, 28, was convicted six years ago of acting with older brother Tamerlan to set off two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed, and hundreds more were injured, many of them seriously.

Like other inmates, Tsarnaev, who has been held at the United States' top security prison in Florence, Colo., received a $1,400 Covid-19 relief payment on June 22, 2021, according to the filing.

He also received $11,230 from the office of federal defenders in New York; $2,500 from someone in Indianapolis; roughly $1,450 from a person in Bloomfield, N.J.; and $950 from a person in Frederick, Maryland, the filing indicated.

Another $3,486.60 came from 32 people who were not identified, the filing says.

Tsarnaev is allowed to keep money to pay for clothing, school books and other items that can help him in jail. But prosecutors said he hasn't been using his money for those purposes or to pay his victims.

Instead, the filing says, he's sent money to others, including his siblings. Payments totaling $2,000 were given to them for ""gifts,"" ""support"" and ""books,"" prosecutors said.

Tsarnaev's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, voted 13-1 in favor of giving 12- to 15-year-olds the boosters at least five months after their second dose. That's in line with newly released guidance from the CDC for people age 16 and older who were initially immunized with the Pfizer vaccine.

Hours later, CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, signed off on the recommendation.

“We now recommend that all adolescents aged 12-17 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their primary series,"" Walensky said Wednesday night. ""This booster dose will provide optimized protection against Coviid-19 and the Omicron variant. I encourage all parents to keep their children up to date with CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.”

Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic

The move came two days after the Food and Drug Administration cleared the extra doses for the age group.

Around 5 million children are immediately eligible for the extra doses, a CDC official told the committee Wednesday.

Before the vote, committee members grappled with how strong the language for the recommendation should be, weighing the risk of the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus as well as data showing adolescents, in general, are less likely to suffer from severe disease from Covid than adults.

“I think we need to highlight that children are not OK,” committee member Dr. Katherine Poehling, a pediatrician at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist in North Carolina, told her colleagues. “It is true children are hospitalized at a less frequent rate than adults, but Covid is overwhelming our hospitals and our children’s hospitals.”

Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University who was the only committee member who voted against the recommendation, said she is not against boosters for kids but worried that it would distract from unvaccinated teens getting their first shots.

Dr. Sara Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer for the CDC, said in a presentation to the committee that U.S. cases have ""rapidly increased"" since the start of December because of the increased prevalence of omicron, which now accounts for around 95 percent of all new cases.

Children generally experience severe illness from Covid less often than adults, but kids are now being hospitalized with the disease at record numbers as the new variant spreads across the country.

At a separate briefing Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, said omicron appears to be less severe than previous variants, but the sheer volume of infections because of its profound transmissibility means that many more children will get infected and end up in the hospital.

Oliver told the committee that the majority of adolescents hospitalized with Covid are unvaccinated. She said Covid cases and hospitalizations are seven to 11 times higher in unvaccinated adolescents when compared to vaccinated adolescents.

""We see a slight increase in hospitalization rates from over the summer, but overall rates remained relatively steady,"" she said, stressing that it's still too early to say how the variant might behave in younger age groups.

The FDA said Monday its decision to broaden eligibility for Pfizer booster shots to adolescents was based in part on real-world data from Israel, which began offering additional shots before many other countries.

Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis of Israel’s Health Ministry presented the data to the CDC committee on Wednesday. She said the country saw a “significant drop” in the rate of infections in adolescents following the start of its booster campaign for the age group.

No new safety concerns were identified out of more than 41,000 booster shots administered in Israel, she said, and there were only two confirmed cases of myocarditis. Both cases occurred in boys, one of whom had a history of an inflammation condition, she said.

The scant data on the risk of myocarditis was criticized by a few health experts in December when the CDC signed off on boosters for 16- and 17-year-olds.

The first two shots of the Pfizer vaccine appear to be well tolerated in the 12- to 15-year-olds who received them, according to data shared to VAERS, a government-funded system for reporting adverse reactions to vaccines.

The most common adverse events reported to VAERS for the age group were dizziness, fainting and headaches, according to the data shared with the committee.

There have been 265 confirmed cases of myocarditis as of Dec. 19, with all but 27 cases occurring in men, according to the data. The CDC said it will continue to monitor vaccine safety among the age group.

Oliver said the Pfizer vaccine appears to be highly protective against multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a rare but serious Covid-related complication.

More than 71 million people in the U.S. have already received a booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to CDC data.

Washington, D.C., and Florida have had the largest jumps in new cases in the last two weeks. Covid cases increased by 902 percent in Washington in that time, while cases in Florida rose by 744 percent, according to an NBC News analysis of state and local health data.

The record single-day total could reflect delayed reporting, as a number of states did not announce data on New Year’s Eve and during the holiday weekend.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the omicron variant of the coronavirus now accounts for up to 95 percent of U.S. test samples that were reviewed last week, according to modeled projections. But the projection could differ from later estimates.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, warned last month that the omicron and delta variants were fueling an alarming trend.

“I am highly concerned that omicron, being highly transmissible and spreading at the same time as delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,” Tedros said Wednesday at a news conference in Geneva.

However, even as U.S. case counts rose in recent weeks, reported deaths did not appear to be surging — suggesting that the omicron variant leads to a more mild form of Covid-19, especially among people who have been vaccinated.

“The general trend that I’m seeing is, if you’re boosted and you get Covid, you really just at worst end up with bad cold symptoms. It’s not like before, where you were coughing, couldn’t say sentences and were short of breath,” Dr. Matthew Bai, an emergency medicine physician at Mount Sinai Queens in New York City, said late last month.

2022-01-04 01:32:02+00:00,84,"Facebook temporarily suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's account on Monday, a day after Twitter ""permanently suspended"" the Georgia congresswoman's personal account for posting misinformation.

“Facebook has joined Twitter in censoring me. This is beyond censorship of speech,” Greene complained on Gettr, the social media website launched by Jason Miller, who was a top aide to former President Donald Trump.

""Who appointed Twitter and Facebook to be the authorities of information and misinformation? When Big Tech decides what political speech of elected Members is accepted and what’s not then they are working against our government and against the interest of our people,"" she wrote.

A spokesperson for Facebook's parent company Meta said in a statement to NBC News that one of Greene's posts ""violated our policies and we have removed it."" The rep did not say what the post said, but added that ""removing her account for this violation is beyond the scope of our policies.”

On Sunday, Twitter announced it had shuttered Greene's personal account ""for repeated violations"" of its Covid-19 misinformation policy.

""We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,"" the company said in a statement.

Greene's social media use has gotten her into trouble before.

The House voted last year to remove the first-term congresswoman from two committees because of her history of spreading dangerous and racist conspiracy theories online. The measure passed 230-199, with 11 Republicans joining every Democrat in the vote.

Greene is an outspoken critic of masking policies and vaccine mandates, and has been hit with numerous fines for refusing to wear a mask on the House floor. She said in November that she has not been vaccinated and that ""vaccine Nazis"" are ""ruining our country.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., issued a statement Monday backing Greene without directly mentioning her name. He criticized ""Big Tech"" and ""recent decisions to silence Americans — including a sitting member of Congress and renowned physicians — who share views different from the political and media elite.""

He said Republican lawmakers would work on ""getting answers — voluntarily or through rigorous congressional oversight — from Twitter and other Big Tech companies surrounding their decision to silence certain Americans and to hold these companies accountable.""

In her own statement Sunday, Greene said, ""Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth.""

""That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies,"" she said.",MSNBC,"['misinformation', 'tech', 'media', 'taylor', 'facebook', 'marjorie', 'greene', 'suspended', 'greenes', 'statement', 'big', 'violations', 'rep', 'vaccine', 'twitter', 'account']",0

2022-01-03 12:03:10+00:00,53,"Twitter suspended a personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., for ""repeated violations"" of its Covid misinformation policy, the company said Sunday.

""We permanently suspended the account you referenced (@mtgreenee) for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,"" Twitter said in a statement. ""We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy.""

Greene appears to still have access to her professional account, @RepMTG. Twitter did not say what was tweeted to earn what it calls a permanent suspension.

Greene said in a statement through her office Sunday that she was suspended for tweeting statistics from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Anyone can report an adverse event to the system, which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency says it is ""not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem.""

""Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth,"" Greene said. ""That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies.""

Twitter implemented a strike system for violations in March. A single strike might not incur an action, but the company will place locks on accounts that repeatedly violate the policy.

Five or more strikes result in a ""permanent suspension,"" according to the company's website. Greene was suspended multiple times last year for violations of the policies.

In January last year, Greene was suspended for making false claims about widespread voter fraud in Georgia. She was also suspended in July and August for violating the Covid-19 policy with tweets about vaccines.

Greene’s suspension is not the first time Twitter has banned an elected official. Last year, it issued a similar action against then-President Donald Trump because of “severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy.""

Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal told CNBC in February that Twitter would uphold the ban even if Trump runs for office again.

“Our policies are designed to make sure that people are not inciting violence,” Segal said. “He was removed when he was president, and there’d be no difference for anybody who’s a public official once they’ve been removed from the service.”",MSNBC,"['strike', 'repeated', 'suspends', 'taylor', 'personal', 'marjorie', 'permanently', 'system', 'greenes', 'suspended', 'greene', 'vaccine', 'violations', 'policy', 'twitter', 'account']",0
