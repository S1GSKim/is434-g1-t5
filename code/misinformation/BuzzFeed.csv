2021-02-05 14:12:34+00:00,6,"As a public defender, my job is to represent poor people charged with crimes. I’ve always had many clients behind bars. But the wall between us was never impermeable until COVID-19 hit.



Before the pandemic, I visited my jailed clients several times a week. I advocated for them in courtrooms. I worked their cases zealously. When COVID hit, my legal practice came to a screeching halt. Jail visits were abruptly cut off. The courthouse was shut down. As I huddled at home with my family, my clients were essentially sealed into mass isolation within the jail. I felt like I was riding away in a lifeboat, leaving everyone stuck on the ship to sink.

None of my clients got sick immediately. Initially, it seemed like the fact that they were isolated from the rest of the world, albeit in miserable conditions, might keep them safe. But staff enter and leave the jails every day, so it was only a matter of time before COVID crept in. When the virus first hit one of our pretrial detention facilities in the spring, it spread like wildfire through the crowded quarters. Our clients were effectively trapped in a burning building.

Everything I learned in three years of law school and 15 years of practice suddenly seemed completely useless. I filed motion after motion, trying to get people out of jail — and trying to ease my conscience. I had very little success. The pandemic created a sort of Catch-22: Clients at institutions still COVID-free were deemed ineligible for release because the danger to their health was not sufficiently imminent. And clients at institutions with active outbreaks were deemed unsafe to release because of the risk they might carry COVID into the community.

As I spun my wheels, more and more of my clients got sick.

In June, a healthy, 43-year-old client I’ll call Alan tested positive for COVID at a jail in Baltimore. He had no symptoms, but was shipped out to Hagerstown to be put in isolation. There, Alan was quarantined in a tent with other prisoners who had tested positive. Alan spent 13 days shackled to a bed in that tent. He was required to urinate in a bed pan. He had no access to a shower. He was not even allowed a phone call to his family to let them know he was alive.

I cannot overstate how stressful this time has been for families of incarcerated people. Visitation has been suspended and jails have been abruptly locked down, limiting communications with the outside world. Family members — whose hearts are in there with their loved ones — are left for days and sometimes weeks at a time imagining the worst.

In October, a 53-year-old client I’ll call Robert was nearing the end of his sentence at a federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, when his roommate became ill with COVID. Prison staff sent the sick man back to the six-person dorm where he shared a bunkbed with Robert. The men were instructed to sleep “head to toe” to reduce the likelihood of transmission. When the prison finally tested the other men, days later, all had COVID. Unsurprisingly, this was just the start of a much larger outbreak: Nearly 1,500 of the 2,500 inmates at Fort Dix have now contracted COVID-19.

If a nursing home or hospital managed an outbreak this way, criminal investigations would follow. But when prisoners’ lives are at stake, we seem content to apply lower standards.

By November, all I could think to do was put money on the commissary accounts of the clients I’d tried and failed to get out, as well as the clients I knew I wouldn’t be able to get out. MoneyGram made a fortune off my guilt; they charge $8.95 per transaction to send money into federal prisons!

I finally won compassionate release for a client this week. It took five months and eight court filings. He’s 36 years old and has end-stage kidney failure. A doctor told the court he would likely die if he got COVID. I planned to pick him up from the prison in North Carolina. But the Bureau of Prisons put him on a bus before I could get there: a 10-hour ride with four stops in the middle of a pandemic.

We continue to incarcerate more people, even as jails and prisons are uncontrolled breeding grounds for this virus. At the federal pretrial detention facility in Baltimore, where many of my clients are housed, one-third of the population has tested positive for COVID since January. The facility is now scrambling, reactively, to take basic precautions that should have been in place many months ago. While Maryland has prioritized vaccinating residents of nursing homes and other congregate facilities, no vaccines have been offered to my clients, who are equally at risk.

It has often been said that a nation’s greatness is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. We have tools to protect incarcerated people, including compassionate release, home confinement, clemency, and, now, a vaccine. We must use these tools unsparingly — or history will judge us harshly for it.

2021-02-02 23:30:34+00:00,37,"""Your olfactory nerve, the nerve involved in your sense of smell, has fibers in your brain and nose that contribute to your ability to smell and, in turn, taste,"" he told BuzzFeed News.



Rajan explained that olfactory training is a method that has been used in medicine to attempt to repair damaged function from diseases that cause similar symptoms to those from COVID-19. The theory is that it helps retrain the nerves, similar to when someone suffers a limb injury.

""A similar concept applies to olfactory training — however, instead of physical rehab, this would involve attempting to stimulate the olfactory system [through] exposure to strong smells,"" he said.

He said that while olfactory training could possibly work for some people but not others. ""Nothing in medicine is ever one size fits all,"" Rajan said. ""We all have remarkably different internal physiology.""

BuzzFeed News also consulted Dr. James Palmer, a professor and director of the Rhinology Department of Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, to ask what he thinks of the recipe.



He said he was a little skeptical about the method, saying there is debate in the field about whether this kind of olfactory training, or smell training, actually works. While a number of papers have examined the loss of smell, there isn't much hard data on the subject, Palmer said, adding that before COVID-19 the number of people losing their sense of smell due to a virus was very small.

Additionally, he said, traditional smell retraining doesn't usually work in the way it was shown in the TikTok video. He said usually it would entail putting different scents in jars and sniffing them ""every day, multiple times.""

Palmer said spontaneous improvement in smell from COVID-19 loss may be as much as one third in the first few weeks but that the success rate is unknown.

However, he said, there's not much you have to lose by trying Lalor's method.

""I don't care if someone wants to burn an orange and then peel it and mix it up, fine with me,"" Palmer said.

In fact, he said if he were to get the virus and lose his sense of smell, he would do olfactory retraining. ""It's going to cost me nothing. I'll set up some home stuff and I'll just go ahead and do it. ... And if I get my sense of smell back, I'll be really happy.""

However, Palmer said, if it doesn't work for you, you should probably just move on.

""If I don't get my sense of smell back [after] six months to a year of olfactory retraining ... I'll probably stop bothering,"" he said.",BuzzFeed,"['palmer', 'loss', 'tiktok', 'recipe', 'moms', 'orange', 'similar', 'work', 'olfactory', 'sense', 'smell', 'covid19', 'viral', 'training', 'ill', 'retraining', 'help']",0

2021-01-20 10:00:47+00:00,25,"In the first hours of his presidency, Joe Biden plans to set in motion a series of reforms to signal a clear and immediate break with the Trump administration’s agenda on everything from climate change to immigration to the pandemic.

He plans to sign dozens of executive orders, memos, directives, and letters early Wednesday night to start his time in office with an energetic shift away from Trump. It marks a return to some Obama-era policies, which Trump made a point of repealing while he was in office, and several policies that are sharply more progressive than what has come before him, especially on racial and gender discrimination.

In one pointed step that indicates the new administration’s perspective on the previous White House’s politics, Biden will immediately rescind Trump’s 1776 Commission, which issued its report just two days ago and aimed to rewrite US history to diminish the harms of slavery and vilify the civil rights movement.

As he steps into the White House the day after the US surpassed 400,000 COVID-19 deaths, one of his immediate focuses will be to put together a cohesive federal approach to mitigating the pandemic and distributing vaccines. To that end, Biden plans to sign an executive order creating a “COVID-19 response coordinator,” who will report directly to Biden and coordinate “all elements of the COVID-19 response across government, including managing efforts to produce, supply, and distribute personal protective equipment, vaccines, and tests.”

His immediate COVID-19 strategy also includes a 100-day masking challenge starting Wednesday; Biden plans on “asking the American people to do their part — their patriotic duty — and mask up for 100 days.” He will additionally sign an executive order to mandate masks in all federal buildings, the only spaces where the president has the authority to enforce a rule like this.

He then plans to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization, to coordinate with international pandemic strategies.

The moves on climate change include immediately rejoining the Paris climate agreement and an executive order to invest in clean energy industries. Biden will also direct federal agencies to reengage with climate change as a serious issue, all parts of his policy platform throughout his campaign.



In another rebuke to Trump administration policies which targeted people of color and other underserved communities, Biden plans to launch a sweeping racial equity initiative, starting with an executive order which would require all federal programs and agencies to focus on “rooting out systemic racism and other barriers to opportunity from federal programs and institutions.”

“The Executive Order will define equity as the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities,” the memo from Biden’s transition detailing the actions said.

After four years of the Trump administration rolling back protections for trans and gender-nonconforming people in everything from education to housing, Biden will also issue an executive order which would ensure that federal authorities interpret Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a central law in many important court cases in recent years, as “prohibiting workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.”

“This Order will also direct agencies to take all lawful steps to make sure that federal anti-discrimination statutes that cover sex discrimination prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ persons,” the memo said.

Biden also plans to sign an executive order intended to strengthen the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was intended to shield undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation. The DACA order calls on the secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the attorney general, to take all appropriate actions to preserve and fortify the program.

The Trump administration tried to end DACA, but was ultimately stopped by a Supreme Court ruling. However, the future of the program remains uncertain as its legality is currently being weighed by a Texas federal judge who blocked then-president Obama's attempt to expand the program in 2015.

Biden’s presidential memorandum will also call on Congress to enact legislation that would provide legal status and a path to citizenship to immigrants who came to this country as children, which would include current DACA recipients.

Another executive order is expected to revoke an executive order signed by Trump in July that sought to exclude millions of undocumented immigrants from being counted when congressional districts are revised following the 2020 Census.

Biden is also expected to sign an executive order putting an end to the Trump administration's travel ban, also known as the “Muslim ban” because the initial one targeted only Muslim-majority countries. The travel ban was later expanded to include six countries, four of them in Africa. Biden's planned executive order repeals Trump's travel ban and instructs the State Department to restart processing visas for the affected countries. The executive order also calls on the government to remedy the impact caused by the travel bans, in particular for people stuck in the waiver process and those who had immigrant visas denied.

Another one of Biden's executive orders will revoke one of Trump's, which expanded the categories of undocumented immigrants who are priorities for deportation. Biden is also expected to sign an executive order that calls for pausing border wall construction.

And in a smaller rollback of one of the last things Trump did as president, Biden plans to sign an executive order that will rescind the “1776 Commission,” a body lamented by historians that was established to spin America’s founding with “patriotic education.” The Biden team’s memo accused the commission of seeking “to erase America’s history of racial injustice.” It just published its report on Monday.

2021-01-14 22:05:03+00:00,17,"In the wake of last week’s attack on the Capitol, members of Congress are getting COVID-19 despite starting vaccinations days earlier.



The cases are a good demonstration of how long it takes people to get immunity after getting a vaccine, and their vulnerability to the coronavirus even after getting their shots, say public health experts.

“No vaccine works in two days. They’re not magic,” said infectious disease expert Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “The human body takes time to develop the antibodies that lead to protection after vaccination.”

On Thursday morning, Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York joined at least three other colleagues who have reported they contracted COVID-19 following the Jan. 6 attack. On Sunday, the Capitol’s attending physician notified lawmakers they were exposed to the virus while dozens of them stayed, some for hours, in a secure conference room during the attack. The three lawmakers noted that several Republicans in the secure room had refused to wear masks.

Espaillat’s office told BuzzFeed News that he tested positive on Wednesday night after routine testing and that he was not experiencing any symptoms. His office did not immediately respond to questions about whether he was in the secure room on the day of the attack. Espaillat was present on the House floor Wednesday night, wearing a face mask during the vote to impeach President Donald Trump.

Espaillat said he received the second dose of the vaccine last week, while Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rep. Brad Schneider received their first doses on Jan. 4.

Once injected, the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines trigger cells to produce proteins mimicking parts of the coronavirus, spurring antibodies to attack the virus as well as more slowly developing “memory” cells that can trigger a longer-term immune response. Both of the vaccines require two shots, spaced apart by 21 days and 28 days respectively, to fully develop this protection. Clinical trials suggest they both bring some protection starting about 10 days after the first shot, but lead to a 95% reduction in COVID-19 cases about two weeks after the second shot, according to the CDC.

Even after those two weeks, it’s still not known whether the vaccines prevent transmission of the virus rather than prevent symptoms. For this reason, health experts strongly recommend that people continue to wear masks after getting vaccinated, the most simple and effective known way to lower the odds of passing around an infection in a crowded setting, said Celine Gounder, a Biden–Harris COVID-19 advisory board member and professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, speaking during a Thursday briefing.

Congress started getting shots in the week before Christmas, starting with top leadership, and second doses of those vaccines only started public distribution last week. That means many of the people secured together during the attack had little protection from infection.

Even before the riot, Capitol Hill had struggled to control infections, with lawmakers flying back and forth to Washington and many Republicans refusing to wear masks. In response to these concerns and in light of the infections following the riot, Democrats in the House on Tuesday introduced a bill that would place a $1,000 fine per day on members who refuse to wear masks in the Capitol.

“The cases we are seeing in Congress, I suspect, we’ll see more,” Adalja said. “They were crowded together with people shouting and yelling, which we know spreads the virus. It has all the ingredients to become a superspreader event.”",BuzzFeed,"['days', 'work', 'week', 'congress', 'virus', 'cases', 'wear', 'newest', 'covid19', 'protection', 'getting', 'attack', 'weeks', 'vaccines']",0

2021-01-12 18:27:25+00:00,5,"Operation Warp Speed officials changed course on their vaccine rollout plans on Tuesday, widening recommendations for who should get COVID-19 shots and promising to send out more first doses, no longer reserving second shots.

The move by the Trump administration’s $18 billion vaccine development public–private partnership comes amid a disappointingly slow first month of nationwide vaccine distribution. The change will aim to maximize the number of people receiving the first of their two shots, offering some protection against a pandemic surging at unprecedented levels nationwide.

Vaccines will now be recommended for all people over the age of 65 or anyone with a high-risk condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, or obesity, a total population estimated to include roughly 109 million people.

The federal government will also start to assist states in setting up mass vaccination sites, Department of Health and Health and Human Services Chief Alex Azar said Tuesday.

“We need doses going to where they will be used most quickly,” said Azar. Allocations of vaccines starting in two weeks will be based on the size of each state’s over-65 population and will require them to report they have used the vaccines they have been given, he added. “Moving on to the broader population when vaccine supply met demand has always been part of the plan.”

In the last week alone, more than 1.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and 22,582 have died, according to the CDC. The OWS changes come ahead of a Thursday briefing by President-elect Joe Biden, whose transition team last week announced similar plans to push out all available vaccine doses, part of a campaign pledge to give 100 million shots in the first 100 days of the Biden administration.



After initially aiming to have 300 million vaccine doses distributed by January, OWS steadily lowered its projections to 20 million by December, a target it also missed, with under 9 million people having received a first shot as of Monday. Vaccination rates are now roughly at 700,000 shots a day nationwide, according to OWS's Gen. Gus Perna, with hopes that will rise to 1 million a day in the next two weeks.

The FDA has authorized two vaccines, one made by Pfizer and the other by Moderna, for emergency use. Large-scale clinical trials found that the vaccines were highly protective against COVID-19 when given in two doses spaced three or four weeks apart. But over the holidays, facing a nationwide surge driven largely by a new extra-contagious coronavirus variant, the United Kingdom moved to expand the window for second doses of its authorized vaccines to as many as 12 weeks. Last week, a World Health Organization expert panel suggested a six-week window was acceptable.

A tense public debate has since played out over the risks of pushing ahead with giving just one shot to maximize the number of people who could be vaccinated in the US. Some fear that it could lead to partially immunized people getting infected and could enable the virus to develop resistance to the vaccines. On Tuesday, Azar stressed his belief that manufacturers would be able to produce enough doses to keep on schedule, and that getting people their second shots would still be a priority.",BuzzFeed,"['vaccine', 'doses', 'nationwide', 'million', 'trump', 'available', 'administration', 'second', 'weeks', 'release', 'shots', 'covid19', 'plan', 'changing', 'week', 'vaccines', 'population']",0
2021-01-05 17:52:05+00:00,15,"Malvina Shabes, known as “Visia” to friends, was just 10 years old when she, her parents, and her nanny escaped their native Poland for Siberia. It was 1939, and the Nazis had just invaded. The family made it out alive, only to find themselves in labor camps in Siberia. Malvina died in Toronto on Nov. 10, 2020, as the coronavirus blazed through her retirement home. She was 93.

Despite the terror of her youth, “she was probably one of the most kind people you would ever meet,” her son Jeff Shabes told BuzzFeed News. “She was always worried about everybody but herself.”

By all accounts, she lived an extraordinary life. A mother of two sons and a friend to many, she never shied away from her life story. “She was a rarity in the sense that she was willing to talk about life in Siberia and what life was like during the war,” Jeff said.

Born in Krakow, Poland, in 1929, she and her family escaped the Nazis “by some miracle,” her son said.

In her stories, Malvina painted a grim picture of the Soviet Union. Following the non aggression pact between Germany and Russia, hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to Siberia and other regions of the USSR as sparsely populated as they were frigid. Like other Polish men, her father had to work in a labor camp under conditions many of his compatriots didn’t survive.

The family had a small apartment with “minimal heat,” she told her son, and there was often not enough food. Malvina had to go to a Russian-language school; it was a language she did not understand, although she eventually learned it and became “somewhat acclimated,” Jeff said. When she met Joseph Shabes, she rebuffed him because he was eight years her senior. She got to know him through her father; both men were committed to resisting the Soviet regime. “They were kind of prisoners, in a loose way,” her son recalled. As time wore on, Malvina and Joseph fell in love. They were married for 63 years when he died.",BuzzFeed,"['escaped', 'son', 'told', 'kind', 'holocaust', 'malvina', 'shabes', 'life', 'family', 'soviet', 'siberia', 'meet', 'pandemic', 'poland', 'jeff']",0

The FDA authorized the United States’ second coronavirus vaccine on Friday, extending an additional lifeline during a pandemic that is killing thousands of Americans every day.

For the second week in a row, the agency gave the green light to a highly effective vaccine based on cutting-edge genetic technology, this one made by the biotech company Moderna. The decision was widely expected, following an FDA advisory panel’s nearly unanimous show of support for it on Thursday.

“With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement.

With the agency’s “emergency use authorization,” which requires less data than a full approval, nearly 6 million doses will be shipped out across the country next week, federal officials have said.

The FDA said Friday that the authorization will allow the vaccine to be used for individuals 18 and over.

Moderna plans to send out 20 million doses by the end of this month and another 80 million doses by the first quarter of 2021. Following a deal announced last week, the Trump administration has secured an additional 100 million doses of the vaccine to be delivered by June of next year.

The two-dose vaccine has much in common with — and even key advantages compared to — Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, which was authorized last week. That vaccine started being administered this week to healthcare workers and people in nursing homes, the groups of vulnerable people whom the CDC recommended giving first priority.

The fervent hope is that together, the two vaccines can slow the spread of a virus that has killed more than 300,000 Americans and stretched intensive care units to their breaking points.



Moderna co-developed the vaccine with scientists at the National Institutes of Health. “I am proud of what the Moderna team has achieved in collaboration with our partners,” said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a statement. “We remain focused on scaling up manufacturing to help us protect as many people as we can from this terrible disease.”

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that this teamwork was built on years of collaborative research on vaccines for other coronaviruses. “It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them,” he said. “That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward.”",BuzzFeed,"['vaccine', 'doses', 'americans', 'fda', 'million', 'authorized', 'states', 'second', 'united', 'covid19', 'week', 'vaccines', 'moderna']",0

2020-12-13 19:17:23+00:00,22,"The first shipments of the COVID-19 vaccine set to be distributed to all 50 states in the US left Pfizer's facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on Sunday morning, at a pivotal moment in the pandemic that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans.

The shipments, which are expected to reach every state on Monday, began two days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following an overwhelming 17–4 vote of confidence from an advisory panel of independent experts.

The first shipments of the vaccine are expected to arrive at 145 distribution sites across the US on Monday, federal officials said. Another 425 sites will receive shipments on Tuesday, and the remaining 66 will get them on Wednesday.

The vaccine offers much-needed hope in battling what has been a devastating crisis for the US, even as the country approaches a grim milestone and is bracing for what public health experts have predicted is going to be a very difficult winter.

2020-12-08 22:48:59+00:00,14,"Erica Becerra had recently moved to Detroit from Los Angeles with her husband and 1-year-old daughter when she began to experience contractions and spent two days at a hospital for observation. Soon after returning home, she began to show COVID-19 symptoms.

On Thursday, she died of complications from the virus, two weeks after giving birth to a son she was never able to hold.



""Erica was the most wonderful person you could ever meet,"" her brother, Miguel Avilez, told Anderson Cooper in an interview on Monday. ""Her main concern was other people. For her, other people's happiness was her happiness.



""She followed every rule in the book and she still ended up catching [the coronavirus].""

Even as they mourn, Avilez and others of Becerra's friends and family have said they want to share her story to raise awareness of the deadliness of COVID-19 and perhaps spare others the pain they are experiencing.



""It’s sad, you know, you've got a lot of people who don’t understand what’s going on, think [the pandemic] is a joke until it happens to them or one of their family members,"" Avilez wrote on Facebook.

2020-12-08 14:17:17+00:00,33,"Last month Pfizer announced promising early results from its coronavirus vaccine trial that suggested the drug was safe and 95% effective at blocking COVID-19. The company said no serious side effects have been observed.

The results from the trial, which has recruited 43,000 participants, were based on 170 people who got infected with the coronavirus. Of them, 8 were in the half of study participants who received the vaccine and the other 162 had received placebo shots, pointing to a high statistical significance of the shots' effectiveness.

With more than 1.7 million confirmed cases of the virus, the rollout of the vaccine has begun with 70 hospitals and comes just over a week after Britain became the first Western country to approve the drug.

Appearing on national television, Britain’s health minister Matt Hancock was tearful as he acknowledged the journey to reach the moment.

“It’s just been such a tough year for so many people and there’s William Shakespeare putting it so simply for everybody that we can get on with our lives,” Hancock told hosts on Good Morning Britain.",BuzzFeed,"['vaccine', 'person', 'uk', '90yearold', 'trial', 'pfizers', 'britain', 'woman', 'william', 'participants', 'hancock', 'results', 'shots', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'received', 'receive']",0

2020-12-03 17:08:20+00:00,26,"Eight months out from the first frightening peak of coronavirus cases in the US, Americans are facing another dangerous surge of the pandemic. More than 100,000 Americans are in the hospital right now, sick with COVID-19 — the most there’s ever been.

At least 13.9 million people in the US have had the virus. Some fully recovered and bounced right back to their lives, perhaps without even knowing they’d ever been infected. Some — at least 273,000 so far — have died.

And others, like me, have been dragged through an indefinite cycle of headaches, exhaustion, chest pains, and shortness of breath, their post-viral symptoms dragging out for weeks that have turned into months, with no end or relief in sight.

I’m 33 years old. Before I got sick with COVID-19 in April, I was traveling nonstop for my work as a campaign reporter, with 12- to 14-hour days on my feet, sometimes working 10 or more days in a row. In between all that, I’d fit in hot yoga classes and jogs every couple of days.

The best way I can describe how I am now, at the end of this strange, horrible year, is that I wake up most days feeling like I drank a six-pack of beer the night before. Washing the dishes, doing my laundry, or walking a few blocks leaves me in need of a sit-down. It’s a sort of gritty feeling in my body, a woolly feeling in my brain. My breathing is up and down; when I'm tired, I forget words midsentence. I need at least 10 hours of sleep most nights. And if I push too hard, it’s not just laborious — it’s actually painful, from my lungs to my head to the stinging in my eyes.

“Hopefully it will improve soon,” one doctor told me a few months ago. That was the extent of her advice.

Before he got sick in July, “I had tons of energy. I’d never take a break, probably like you,” Junior Ky, a 27-year-old musician and patient benefit adviser at a hospital in Orlando, told me. “And just all of a sudden, it just hit me out of nowhere. I went from feeling 27 to feeling like I'm 207 years old.”

For the past eight months, those of us who have long-term post-COVID symptoms, as well as those who’ve watched loved ones suffer or die from the virus, have seen the president refuse to acknowledge that COVID-19 has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and made many millions more sick, calling it a “Fake News Media Conspiracy” — even after getting sick himself.

“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said right after coming out of Walter Reed Medical Center, where he’d been treated with antibodies and steroids inaccessible to most Americans. “You’re going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines, all developed recently.”

Of course, hundreds of thousands of people haven’t simply “beaten” the virus. Now, can the US be a place where someone can survive even if they’re knocked off track by a severe illness? The answer, for a long time, has been that it is not.

This country’s disability safety net has been woefully inadequate since well before the pandemic. It’s certainly not capable now of handling the needs of everyone who is currently seeing or will in the next few months see their lives dramatically upended by long-term COVID-related illness.

We have a president-elect who has acknowledged the devastation of COVID-19 and has a clear plan to address the pandemic — but there are still two and a half months to survive before that plan can be put into action. And there’s still no specific plan to federally fund clinics or research to help people with lingering symptoms. Biden’s main offering, according to his team, is to protect health insurance coverage for preexisting conditions and make insurance accessible for those who lose their jobs because of the pandemic. That will make a crucial difference for many people who have long-term symptoms and no health insurance — but even those of us with post-viral problems who already have decent health insurance are struggling to access guidance and care.",BuzzFeed,"['im', 'symptoms', 'months', 'old', 'virus', 'feeling', 'ago', 'right', 'covid19', 'pandemic', 'insurance', '33', 'sick', 'americans']",0
2020-12-02 16:50:12+00:00,3,"The CDC on Wednesday announced that COVID-19 quarantines can be shortened to seven days after negative test results and no symptoms.

CDC COVID-19 incident manager Henry Walke said 14 days remains the baseline quarantine recommendation for people exposed to someone diagnosed with the coronavirus. But the shortened time periods — 10 days without symptoms and 7 days with no symptoms and a negative test — are intended to give people more options for returning to work.

That negative test should be from a genetic PCR test, not a rapid test, which is more likely to return a false negative if someone is not tested at the peak of their infection.

This change does not affect people who have tested positive for COVID-19, who are still required to self-isolate for 10 days.

The chances of people spreading illness after these shorter time periods fall into a ""sweet spot,"" for acceptable risks, said Walke. The estimate is a 1% chance of actually turning out to be sick after 10 days without symptoms leading to transmission, and a 5% chance after seven days without symptoms and a negative test.



""We may get a greater compliance overall with people completing a full quarantine in seven days,"" he said.

Epidemiologist Saskia Popescu, an affiliate of the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security, suggested on Twitter that the CDC's shift reflected the difficulty of getting people to quarantine for a full two weeks. ""Glad to see a movement in this direction,"" she added, but expressed concern that the CDC's suggestion to test on the fifth day of a seven-day quarantine, for example, might lead to some missed COVID-19 cases.

As well as the shift in guidelines, CDC officials on the briefing call urged people to avoid travel this Christmas, citing surging COVID-19 caseloads nationwide.",BuzzFeed,"['days', 'quarantine', 'cdc', 'guidance', 'symptoms', 'ok', 'say', 'tested', 'test', 'shortened', 'covid19', 'changed', 'seven', 'negative', 'shorter', 'walke']",0

2022-01-28 21:10:03+00:00,37,"COVID-19 vaccines were first authorized for emergency use in the U.S. in December 2020. Studies following the use of the vaccines showed approximately 90% protection against symptomatic infection, severe illness, and death. By July 2021, we saw decreased vaccine effectiveness against infection as new variants emerged, and CDC put forward recommendations to continue masking, even for people who had received a primary series. Over the ensuing months and in the context of updated vaccine booster recommendations, more than 20 ACIP meetings have publicly reviewed data on vaccine effectiveness and have provided real-time data demonstrating COVID-19 vaccines and boosters remain highly protective against severe illness and death. Importantly, the rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths are substantially higher among unvaccinated adults than among those who have received a primary series and those who are up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among adults aged ≥65 years. Protection provided by the current vaccines against symptomatic infection and transmission is less than that against severe disease and diminishes over time, especially against the currently circulating variants. For this reason, it is important to stay up to date, especially as new vaccines become available.",BuzzFeed,"['vaccine', 'recommendations', 'variants', 'severe', 'benefits', 'covid19', 'symptomatic', 'getting', 'received', 'vaccines', 'series', 'infection']",0
