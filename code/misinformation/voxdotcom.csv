2021-02-27 20:21:43+00:00,26,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-27 12:09:15+00:00,71,"Democrats have overcome an important hurdle in Covid-19 relief: The House of Representatives passed its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, sending it off to the Senate.

The bill passed around 2 am Saturday, in a 219-212 vote, with every Republican voting no. Democratic Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon also opposed the bill.

The bill includes some big-ticket items that would deliver important relief to businesses, workers, and the broader economy. It includes $1,400 stimulus checks for those making up to $75,000 a year, $400 expanded weekly unemployment insurance benefits through August 29, and billions of dollars for designates such as schools, state and local governments, and restaurants. It also increases Affordable Care Act subsidies for low- and middle-income Americans and expands both the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit.

The bill also includes a $15 federal minimum wage, though the provision is dead in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday evening that the minimum wage hike cannot be passed under the rules of budget reconciliation.

In a statement on Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said he is “deeply disappointed” in the ruling but noted that House Democrats would pass the bill as is, even though it will ultimately change in the Senate. “Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour remains a centerpiece of House Democrats’ economic plan and would provide a major boost in income to 27 million Americans while lifting nearly a million out of poverty,” he said.

Some Democrats sought to find workarounds for the parliamentarian’s ruling, including looking at a potential tax penalty that would incentivize corporations to pay a $15 minimum wage. But that appears to be off the table for now — a source familiar with the matter said that Democrats have backed away from finalizing that “plan B” after realizing it would delay passage of the bill and risk going past March 14, when extended unemployment benefits expire.

Now that the House has passed a version of the bill, the Senate has begun working on some changes to the text. After that, it’s likely to get bounced back to the House, which would need to pass whatever the eventual agreed-on version of the legislation would be before it lands on President Joe Biden’s desk. The clock is ticking: As mentioned, Democrats do not want to push workers off an unemployment cliff.

You can find a complete look at what’s in the House bill here.

Democrats are taking a big swing here

Biden first introduced his proposal for a sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package in January, which the congressional plan largely mirrors. Democrats and many economists have for months argued that the federal government’s pandemic response risks doing too little, not too much, to help the country and the economy. Many lawmakers feel the government undershot its response to the 2009 Great Recession, incorrectly assuming they’d have multiple chances at major legislation. They’re determined not to make that mistake this time around.

“We can’t do too much here,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office in early February. “We can do too little and sputter.”

Democrats, including the president, have argued that it’s an important moment for deficit spending to help people in need, also noting that interest rates are low and are expected to stay that way for quite some time. “Every major economist thinks we should be investing in deficit spending in order to generate economic growth,” Biden told reporters in January.

To be sure, Democrats and the White House have received some pushback.

Republicans have broadly criticized the Democratic proposal. A group of 10 Senate Republicans put forth a counteroffer to Biden’s $1.9 trillion package, proposing instead a $600 billion bill that would have addressed some immediate public health needs, such as vaccinations and testing, and food aid. But it shrank spending in areas such as unemployment, stimulus checks, and schools, and left out state and local aid altogether.

Some economists who are more centrist or even Democratic have questioned whether the legislation is too ambitious. Larry Summers, an economist who served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, wrote an op-ed warning the bill might cause future inflation or make less politically palatable further stimulus. Summers’s concerns, while not out of left field, are not necessarily widely shared — many economists pointed out that a little bit of inflation would indeed be good, and the Federal Reserve has tools to combat it.

Before Summers’s op-ed, Austan Goolsbee, another Obama economic alum, published an op-ed in the New York Times warning that the country could fall into a double-dip recession, meaning the economy could get better and then fall again, and called for a proactive response from the federal government. He wrote that a “wait and see” approach on a relief program “has been proved to be deeply wrong since the pandemic began,” and noted that the virus has caused people to withdraw from the economy. “Much damage has already been done — and it is evident not only in lost jobs but in lost income and lost companies,” he wrote. “This harm could have been prevented. It definitely should not be repeated now.”

There is plenty of space to debate what’s in the legislation, what should be there and what should not. Some provisions, such as higher ACA subsidies, the expanded child tax credit, and the expanded earned income tax credit, are only temporary, and it’s unclear whether they’ll last beyond the next year or two. The House bill cut off a month of expanded unemployment insurance, which Biden initially proposed extending through September. Democrats also opted against including automatic stabilizers in the bill, which would tie supports such as unemployment insurance to economic conditions rather than arbitrary end dates.

That the House has passed a version of the package doesn’t mean the process is over — there’s still quite a way to go before it lands in the Oval Office — but it’s an important step.

2021-02-27 02:48:01+00:00,10,"There have been some bright spots recently in the fight against Covid-19: Infection rates are dropping in most states, more and more Americans are becoming eligible for vaccination, and the Food and Drug Administration now says the Johnson & Johnson vaccine meets the requirements for emergency use authorization. Meanwhile, new research finds that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not only effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death, but they’re probably quite effective at preventing transmission, too.

But the optimism is tempered somewhat by the spread of more contagious Covid-19 variants, like B.1.1.7 and 501Y.V2, initially discovered in the UK and South Africa, respectively. Experts say the B.1.1.7 variant could be dominant in the US by March.

That means we need to be more careful about protecting ourselves. To do that, public health officials are recommending that people make a greater effort to avoid indoor spaces like grocery stores and double-mask when going indoors in a public setting.

Which has some people wondering: Should we be more careful outdoors, too? Do we now need to stay more than 6 feet away from our friends around that fire pit? What about those joggers who seem to be perpetually running toward us, unmasked?

Epidemiologists say they’ve been seeing these questions pop up a lot, and while it’s totally understandable to wonder about outdoor risks, it’s also somewhat misguided.

“There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist at University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, told Vox. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

Muge Cevik, a virologist and physician at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told me there are “many things to worry about — outdoor brief contact is not one of them.”

Therefore, outdoor risk is negligible unless it involves close interaction or you are in a crowded or semi-outdoor environment. For example, walking on the street with no f2f contact, or passing by a jogger, the risk is very low as the duration of interaction is brief. (7/n) — Muge Cevik (@mugecevik) January 11, 2021

That’s because, as I’ve explained before, a perfect sequence of events has to happen for a virus to move from an infected passerby outdoors to you.

The passerby has to spray out enough particles to be able to kick-start an infection. The virus inside the particles has to survive as sunlight, wind, and other forces work to decay and disperse them. The particles have to land in your upper throat or respiratory tract — or on your hands, which you then use to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth — and they have to get past all the barriers to infection in the respiratory system, like nose hairs and mucus. Then they have to dock up with your cells’ ACE-2 receptors and use them to enter the cells.

Even given what we’ve learned over the past months about airborne transmission, this is a pretty arduous sequence for viral particles to execute properly.

“The volume of distribution of gases within an outside space, particularly with a wind factor, makes this risk very low,” Cevik said. “A variant may be more transmissible, but physics has not changed.”

Low risk is not zero risk, of course. Close or prolonged contact with others (especially unmasked) or settings where there are lots of people should be avoided even if outdoors. But the main risk we have to worry about is still indoors.

What makes the new variants more contagious?

We know that the new variants spread between people more easily — but how do they do so? We’ve got some preliminary clues, but we still don’t have conclusive answers.

Angela Rasmussen, a Georgetown University virologist who agrees there’s minimal risk outdoors, nonetheless warns that there’s still much we don’t know about the new variants. “It’s really hard to say if we need to be more careful with outdoor interactions with the new variants because we don’t know the mechanism by which they are more transmissible,” she told me. “Is it that people shed more virus? The virus is more efficient at causing infections? Is the virus more stable in the environment?”

Since January, Cevik has suspected that the virus has gotten better at binding to the receptors in human cells. Both the B.1.1.7 and 501Y.V2 variants feature a lot of mutations in the virus’s spike protein, the piece that fits into the receptors. And if a variant is better at attaching to receptors, then once people are exposed to it, they may be more likely to get infected — even if the sick person they’ve encountered isn’t shedding more virus.

New lab research has demonstrated that increased receptor binding is in fact happening with these variants. There may be other factors at play, too. Better receptor binding could influence the infectious dose (the amount of virus needed to launch an infection).

It could also lead to a longer infection. Some new data gathered from NBA players suggests that with B.1.1.7, people stay infectious for longer, which could be upping the transmissibility: People may think they can safely stop quarantining after 14 days, but then they pass the infection on to others. (This is already sparking debate about whether we should extend quarantine guidelines, but it’s worth noting that the NBA evidence is from only seven players, a very small data set.)

Further studies on more potential processes underlying transmission — like how fast the variants replicate in the body and how long the variants survive in the environment — are pending. Cevik says we’ll be able to understand these dynamics more in a few weeks.

So, for now, what should we do outside?

The variants make everywhere a bit riskier than before. According to Boston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray, “It’s still unlikely that you would get infected passing an unmasked jogger, but the risk of that is now a bit more like passing two unmasked joggers.”

But the ways the virus spreads are still the same. So, Rasmussen said, “I don’t think that staying 6 versus 10 feet [apart] matters much outdoors. What might be more useful to think about is the nature of outdoor contacts. Are there lots of people? Are they wearing masks? Is it fully outdoors or in some kind of partial enclosure?”

The experts I spoke to recommended sticking to smaller group sizes and wearing a mask outdoors (at least one mask; two if you want to be extra careful). After all, if the variants lead to higher community prevalence in your area, you’ll be more likely to come across someone who is infectious.

But let’s not lose sight of the fact that the greatest risk is still indoor interactions.

“The main risk with the variant, I would say, is indoors now, because earlier evidence suggests that it clusters more in households compared to older variants, and more people are spending time indoors now,” Cevik said. “We are seeing significant outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals due to the new variant.”

So it makes sense to cut ourselves some slack outdoors, and avoid shaming others for their outdoor activities. “There’s a delicate balance between preventing infections and increasing lockdown fatigue,” she wrote. “People do not have unlimited energy, so we should ask them to be vigilant where it matters most, which is indoors, while giving them a break outdoors.”",voxdotcom,"['transmission', 'risk', 'virus', 'covid19', 'cevik', 'outdoor', 'spread', 'infection', 'dont', 'outdoors', 'variants', 'careful', 'indoors']",0
2021-02-27 02:45:06+00:00,9,"Are we in the endgame now?

The Covid-19 pandemic in the United States has decelerated from its winter peak. On January 8, the country saw more than 300,000 new cases — a single-day record. Also on January 8, the US peaked at nearly 250,000 cases a day based on a weekly rolling average, according to Our World in Data.

As of February 24, the US is averaging a little more than 68,000 new Covid-19 cases every day. Hospitalizations have also decreased (to about 54,000 patients currently hospitalized, down from a peak of 130,000 in mid-January), as have deaths.

The improvement in the pandemic is significant. It’s likely attributable to a combination of people staying home after the winter holidays and more Americans gaining protection against future infection (whether through infection or vaccination).

The big question now is whether we’re seeing the beginning of the end. As more people are vaccinated, will this downward trajectory continue, or even accelerate? Or will case numbers start to level off and stay high (relative to most of 2020) for months?

The progress should be celebrated. Hospitalizations and deaths, arguably the more important metrics, are also way down. As more people get vaccinated, those numbers should continue to fall, as the approved vaccines have proven exceptionally effective at preventing the most serious illness. The US is now averaging about 1.3 million shots every day; with some improvement, the country may be able to deliver enough shots to reach herd immunity by the fall, according to some rough estimates.

But there are already signs that some states, particularly in the Northeast, are beginning to see cases plateau. A plateau would mean a more drawn-out final stage of the pandemic until widespread protection is reached — and more sickness and death than we’d see if cases keep falling. And it was a very real fear for the half-dozen public health experts I spoke with for this story.

“I think that you could call it an endgame, but it might take a long time,” Bill Hanage, a Harvard epidemiologist, told me. “I think we have passed the worst of the pandemic, but there is the potential for local bushfires to spring up.”

Experts worry people will relax their social distancing or mask-wearing too quickly, giving the virus more opportunities to spread. The more infectious new variants will continue to become more dominant and could exacerbate community transmission if people stop taking precautions.

Still, the general attitude I detected from epidemiologists is one of guarded optimism that the pandemic is entering its last stage — paired with anxiety that these final months could be more painful than need be if people get complacent.

“We need to take the pandemic seriously and not let up on our prevention efforts,” Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “At least until our case numbers are much lower than they are now.”

Cases are going down nationally. But the decline may be tapering off.

The national numbers speak for themselves: The US is now seeing about one-fourth as many daily new cases as it was six weeks ago.

But that progress is more a representation of just how bad things got in December and January than it is an acceptable level of infection on its own terms. Right now, the national caseload is at roughly the same level as in the weeks before Election Day, which nobody would have called acceptable at the time. As Vox’s German Lopez has reported, every state in the country except for one — Hawaii — still has too many daily new Covid-19 infections, according to benchmarks set by experts.

“We’re still far from being out of the woods,” Tara Smith, a professor at the Kent State University College of Public Health, told me. “It’s better than where we were for late fall and early winter, but not nearly back to our lowest level of spread.”

National data can also obscure some of the important trends happening at the regional and state levels, where experts see indications that cases are not falling with the same speed.

Look at the Northeast: The average number of daily new cases dropped from 28,000 on February 1 to 19,400 on February 14. But the improvement seems to be slowing down in the back half of the month, with new cases in the region hovering right around 16,000 as of February 23. Cases have actually risen in Connecticut and Rhode Island over the past week. And while case numbers are going down a bit in several states in the region, including New York, Massachusetts, and Maine, the declines have been smaller than in other parts of the country.

“The Northeast in general appears to be settling down into a plateau,” Hanage said. Yet those states are pushing ahead with reopening: Massachusetts is moving into a new phase, allowing indoor performance spaces to hold events at 50 percent capacity. New York is now permitting more indoor dining.

Several experts told me they are also watching Florida, where the new B.1.1.7 variant is spreading rapidly and Gov. Ron DeSantis has been generally lax about social distancing and mask measures throughout the pandemic. New cases are down just 12 percent in the last week, and the state has one of the higher rates of new cases per capita outside of the Northeast.

So, there are already some potential trouble spots worth watching. But fortunately, the country has some important things working in its favor that could prevent these outbreaks from spiraling out of control again.

The reasons for optimism about the pandemic winding down

The way the Covid-19 pandemic ultimately ends is the virus runs out of people to infect. Every day, more Americans are gaining protection from the coronavirus, making it more difficult for it to spread.

There are the 28.4 million people who have had a confirmed case of Covid-19, for starters — likely an undercount, however, given the inadequate testing in the United States. A study published in JAMA last month estimated that, as of mid-November, the real number of infections had reached 46.9 million, a number that would have only grown since then.

In addition, roughly 45 million Americans have received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which gives them some level of protection against the virus. We are nowhere near herd immunity yet (generally thought to mean at least 60 percent of the population has protection against the virus, and we may need closer to 70 or 80 percent for a virus as infectious as SARS-CoV-2), but the number of people who are vulnerable to the coronavirus is shrinking.

People may also be socially distancing more than they did around Thanksgiving and Christmas, when indoor gatherings seemed to drive the winter surge. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson observed, public health officials have cited Google mobility data showing less movement as one likely explanation for the downturn in cases. People may be nervous about the surge or the variants, but other factors might be in play, too, such as a normal post-holiday lull, or the bad weather across much of the country. The result is the same: The reduction in activity means fewer opportunities for people to spread the virus to one another.

Polling also continues to show most Americans say they are wearing masks every time they leave their house. These behaviors are hopefully having the desired effect and helping to lower transmission.

“We’re reaping some benefit from changes to individual behaviors and policies that occurred during and after the December and January surge in cases,” Michaud told me, “which eventually helped drive down transmission through things like greater adherence to masking and social distancing in many places.”

The warming weather should also work in our favor. While scientists still don’t perfectly understand how seasonality affects Covid-19’s spread, hotter temperatures will make it easier for people to gather outside, where the virus has a harder time moving from person to person.

The reasons for concern that the US will enter a long plateau

Experts still worry the end of the Covid-19 pandemic will be more protracted than necessary if local officials and individuals are too cavalier about resuming public activities and relaxing social distancing.

The problem starts with how many people are still susceptible to the virus. If we combine the numbers above on real infections and vaccinations, somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 million to 120 million Americans probably have some immunity to the coronavirus. But that still leaves 200 million people who don’t.

Yet people and politicians may look at the dropping case numbers and, after a year of quarantine and economic turmoil, be eager to get life back to normal as soon as possible. It’s a pattern we saw last year, when states started reopening businesses even while public health experts warned the virus wasn’t contained. The dips didn’t last and cases rose again.

Recent policy changes, such as New York City’s plan to permit movie theaters to hold screenings at limited capacity and Iowa lifting its mask mandate, suggest that the country might repeat the same cycle over the next few months.

“The risks come from reopening too soon and removing mask and distancing requirements,” Smith said. “I’m worried about complacency as cases decrease. It seems we haven’t yet learned the lessons of the pandemic, that if you start trying to return to ‘normal’ too soon, cases creep back up again.”

Any slowdown in the vaccination campaign would also lengthen the pandemic. For now, there is plenty of demand for the vaccines and more supply on the way. People seem to be growing more comfortable with the idea of getting the vaccine.

But the US may reach a point, before too long, when it has more shots than people willing to take them. David Celentano, who leads the epidemiology department at Johns Hopkins, said that if 20 percent to 30 percent of Americans remain hesitant about getting the vaccines, “we are in for trouble.”

So to keep up momentum, we need to remain vigilant about wearing masks and maintaining distance when we’re with people outside our household. We need to stick to outdoor activities as the weather makes them more palatable. And we need to keep getting our vaccines in order to keep building toward the herd immunity that will eventually bring the pandemic under control and allow life to return to normal.

Several of the experts I spoke with said they saw autumn as the critical moment in the pandemic. If over the summer we can keep cases suppressed while continuing to vaccinate people at a high rate, by the time the weather turns, the situation could be very different from 2020. Smith told me she had hope for a “normal-ish” late summer and fall.

“One of the best-case scenarios is that next fall, this will be like the flu,” Hanage said. “I think that will have been a good place to have reached.”

2021-02-26 23:04:27+00:00,22,"The Food and Drug Administration is working through thousands of pages of documentation for an emergency authorization of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which could come through this month. Most states are gradually expanding vaccine eligibility, production of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is increasing, and new studies show good results for additional vaccine candidates as well.

The news on the Covid-19 vaccine front of late has been quite good — perhaps so good that our perspective on the fight against the pandemic may be getting a little warped.

Case in point: the media coverage and public reception of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Results from its trials were released last week. According to the company, it should be able to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of this year. But this good news hasn’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanied announcements about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Perhaps that’s because in its clinical trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy number — the percentage of cases prevented entirely — of 66 percent. Compared against the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine and the 94.1 rate for Moderna’s, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine simply doesn’t look as good.

But in another sense, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial results were incredibly encouraging. The same trial showed that J&J’s vaccine makes Covid-19 cases much milder, meaning you might still get sick but you are much less likely to be hospitalized or die. Indeed, on that front, the J&J vaccine performs just as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, a fact that seems to have been undersold in news coverage about it.

To put J&J’s effectiveness in another context, think about the flu. Flu vaccines mostly don’t prevent you from getting sick with the flu but instead make the flu much less awful if you catch it and less fatal for at-risk populations. A Covid-19 vaccine that was similar to that — one that made you much less likely to be hospitalized or die, and made the disease milder — would still be enough to help bring the pandemic to an end and give us back our lives.

That’s exactly what we have with the current crop of vaccines, including the three that haven’t been received as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. No one who got two doses in clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines has been hospitalized or died, and the same holds true for the new vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Novavax (which haven’t yet been approved in the US). Each of the vaccines has demonstrated very high protection against severe Covid-19 in trials.

So why aren’t we talking about that?

How “efficacy” became the measure of vaccine success

The vaccines developed against Covid-19 can protect people in three ways. First, they can make the vaccinated person less likely to catch the disease. That’s called “efficacy.” It’s the number that made the headlines when Pfizer and Moderna results came out this fall — 95 percent and 94.1 percent efficacy, respectively. For every 20 people in the control group to develop symptoms of Covid-19, only one in the vaccinated group did.

That’s an incredible achievement, and it’s what’s gotten most of the attention in the reporting on the vaccines. But it has overshadowed discussion of the other two ways a vaccine against Covid-19 can protect people.

The second is that the vaccines seem to make vaccinated people less likely to transmit the disease; new research suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do this, too, though imperfectly (so you should still be cautious around unvaccinated people).

And the third way the vaccines can protect people is by ensuring that when a vaccinated person does get the disease, they experience a mild case and are not likely to require hospitalization or be at risk of dying.

This last finding is a big deal. As long as vaccines can make sure that Covid-19, even if you get it, isn’t very bad, we can use them to chart our way out of the pandemic. But this effect of the vaccines has been largely neglected.

Now, there’s a reason headlines have focused on the efficacy of preventing all disease rather than severe disease: It’s what the earliest clinical trials were primarily set up to study.

Every clinical trial defines in advance a primary clinical endpoint: the outcome researchers are primarily focused on studying. The study is designed to have a large enough sample size to detect differences in this primary outcome between the trial group and the placebo group. For the vaccine trials, the primary clinical endpoint has largely been symptomatic Covid-19 infection (however mild or severe), or, in some cases, a positive Covid-19 PCR test.

It makes sense for the studies to set that endpoint. Designing a study to measure rare events like hospitalization or death is much harder than designing a study to measure relatively common events like infection. Covid-19 is a scary disease, but less than 1 percent of people who get it will die from it. That means that a study designed with death from Covid-19 as a primary clinical endpoint would need to be enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of participants. Pinning down the exact frequency of rare events requires a lot of data, and vaccine developers could only include so many people in their first clinical trials because recruiting and coordinating participants is expensive and time-consuming.

So instead, most studies primarily measure how many cases of Covid-19 the vaccines prevent. They do collect data on hospitalizations and deaths, but it’s not the primary outcome their studies are designed to measure, and that has been reflected in press releases, media coverage, and the popular understanding of how well the vaccines work.

As it happens, that data on hospitalizations and deaths looks really good. Indeed, there have been zero cases of hospitalization or death in clinical trials for all of these vaccines. But we hear about that less partly because the studies weren’t designed with that outcome in mind.

This focus on preventing cases, rather than preventing cases as well as hospitalizations and deaths, may have led to the sentiment that the new, unapproved vaccines are worse, and that it’s okay that the US isn’t expediting their approval and distribution because people would rather get the better vaccines anyway. This line of reasoning would be understandable if some vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death and some are only 60 percent effective. But in this instance, it’s a mistake, since all of the vaccines are indistinguishably effective by this metric.

The focus on studying efficacy, instead of studying hospitalization and death, affects major policy calls.

South Africa suspended its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a new study found that the vaccine had very low — potentially zero — efficacy against the variant strain of the disease that predominates in the country. Obviously, that finding was really bad news for the AstraZeneca vaccine. But less widely broadcast was the fact that no one in the study got seriously ill or was hospitalized from Covid-19 (no one in the placebo group did, either; the study was small and didn’t contain at-risk people).

Now, let’s be clear: While other studies have convincingly demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against hospitalization and death, it seems to work less well against the South African virus variant, and that might well mean it works less well to prevent hospitalization and death as well. One crucial caveat here is that the study population was young; we would not have expected many hospitalizations or any deaths within that age group. So it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine has very limited usefulness against the new strain. Or it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers very strong protection against severe disease from the new strain. The study was not set up to answer that question, so we simply don’t know.

In that regard, South Africa’s decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout based on the discouraging data makes some sense. But countries that have focused on hospitalization and death statistics, rather than efficacy statistics, have made the opposite call.

“I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, defending Britain’s continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Countries face tough choices here, and their leaders would be able to make a vastly more informed decision if there had been a study with sufficient statistical power — a lot more participants — to detect whether the vaccine is protecting against hospitalization and death. As it is, the understandable focus on efficacy simply doesn’t give us much information on this essential question.

The communications challenge of vaccine statistics

In the past few weeks, some public health experts have started working to change the conversation on vaccines to focus on the key hospitalization and death numbers. One person leading this effort is Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tweeted on January 31:

Am often asked about different vaccines and their efficacy



Each trials tracks, reports efficacy differently



Currently, we have preliminary results for Novavax and J&J



But what numbers matter? What should you look for?



Here's one set of data to track. In a simple table pic.twitter.com/9m2OBgqcla — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) February 1, 2021

One note about this data: It refers only to the clinical trials. Now that the vaccine is out in the world, we’re getting real-world data. The news is still good: 700,000 people in Israel have been vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and there have in fact been a few hospitalizations — 16, to be precise, for a rate of 0.002 percent — and no deaths.

Jha’s message was widely shared, but efficacy still continues to be the statistic that people fixate on.

Communications about severe disease and hospitalization face an uphill battle. Efficacy is much easier to explain — do you get sick or not? For severe disease, on the other hand, many studies have slightly different benchmarks for severity. And while right now there have been zero hospitalizations and zero deaths by anyone vaccinated in the clinical trials for any of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, it doesn’t mean those outcomes are guaranteed. (Again, in Israel, 0.002 percent have been hospitalized so far — that’s very, very low, but it’s not zero.)

Furthermore, as the pandemic stretches into its second year, we’re all desperate for certainty. “This study simply didn’t collect enough data to tell us what we hoped to learn” is not the answer any of us are looking for. The efficacy of the vaccines is known; their effectiveness against hospitalization and death is known to be very high but not pinned down for certain, especially not against the South African variant. All of those pose extraordinary challenges for public health officials and the media to communicate.

But a shift from a focus on efficacy to a focus on improved outcomes is essential for good vaccine decision-making. Moderna and Pfizer can’t produce enough mRNA vaccines alone to end the pandemic, so the public embrace of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — and potentially the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which we’re waiting to learn more on — might make a huge difference for whether things start to get back to normal in the US in April or in August. That’s a difference of potentially hundreds of thousands of lives lost.",voxdotcom,"['important', 'looking', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'clinical', 'johnson', 'disease', 'study', 'statistic', 'hospitalization', 'death', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-26 23:02:13+00:00,24,"A panel of expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously on Friday afternoon to recommend the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson for an emergency use authorization. The next step is for the FDA to accept the recommendation, which could happen as soon as this weekend, clearing the way for distribution.

Earlier this week, the FDA posted a briefing going over the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which included 40,000 participants in several countries divided randomly into placebo and treatment groups.

The most important finding: The vaccine was 100 percent effective after 28 days at preventing deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 among the clinical trial participants who received the treatment. (Two vaccine recipients were hospitalized with Covid-19 two weeks after receiving the injection.)

The vaccine was also 66.1 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness after four weeks, with consistent results across all age groups. When looking at blocking severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.4 percent effective.

Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, said during a press conference last month that the vaccine also had “plain vanilla safety results,” with the vast majority of recipients experiencing no problems. Most of the reported symptoms were mild, including fatigue, arm pain, and fever.

The efficacy levels against severe to critical Covid-19 changed depending on where the vaccine was tested. It was 85.9 percent in the United States after four weeks, while in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, efficacy against severe disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.

Health officials say that while the Johnson & Johnson efficacy results are not as high as those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, the two vaccines that have already received emergency use authorizations from the FDA, the new vaccine’s performance is still superb.

“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the press conference last month. The vaccine was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson based in Belgium, together with Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson’s doesn’t require a booster shot, circumventing the two-dose problems posed by its competitors. There’s no need to track people down for their second dose, which means more people could be vaccinated faster. The shots also don’t require deep-cold storage, which means they’re less costly and somewhat easier to distribute.

“It’s a complete game changer,” said Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin. “It completely changes the equation.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also different in another way. It uses an adenovirus vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also less expensive to manufacture than the mRNA platform used for the other vaccines. (It’s estimated to cost around $10 per vaccine dose — roughly half the cost of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.)

Johnson & Johnson has promised enough vaccines for 20 million Americans by the end of March and 100 million Americans by the end of June despite production challenges. It would be a huge boost to the 65 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in the US so far.

So even with an overall efficacy level that’s lower than the two other vaccines on the US market, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could become a major player. It’s the vaccine that “can increase equity,” said Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, particularly “if it’s deployed strategically in nations that are hard to reach and where that would be a particular challenge under a two-dose schedule.” Johnson & Johnson expects to distribute a billion doses of its vaccine worldwide this year.

But as amazing as it is to see several effective Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time, it’s now clear that the technology alone won’t save the day. An orchestra of supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, staff, and public trust needs to harmonize in order to actually get billions of shots into arms around the world and finally draw the pandemic to a close. And we also have other hurdles to overcome: controlling the spread of variants that seem to be threatening the effectiveness of all the vaccines we have.

What we learned about the safety and efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine

Johnson & Johnson launched separate clinical trials testing both a one-dose and a two-dose regimen to see how well these strategies provided long-term protection against Covid-19. The one-dose phase 3 trial arm yielded efficacy results first.

But hints that this vaccine could be safe and effective have been trickling out for months. The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

“You know, we’ve got millions of people who’ve received these vaccines already, which is exciting,” he added. “We’re on our way.”",voxdotcom,"['advisers', 'vector', 'phase', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'world', 'johnson', 'recommend', 'johnsons', 'fda', 'adenovirus', 'unanimously', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-26 15:59:01+00:00,3,"I’ve never been one to put too much stock in the idea that clothing has to be practical. Scrolling back through photos from those blissfully naive first months of 2020, my outfits make that much clear: There’s the faux-pearl bra top and holographic motorcycle jacket I wore to a friend’s birthday party; the leopard-print creeper shoes that carried me through 30,000-step days in Tokyo; the pink, bedazzled thrift store blazer I wore one night at Mardi Gras that I like to think would have made Dolly Parton proud.

A year later, I have a hard time reconciling that person with the me who wakes up every morning and decides between two pairs of sweatpants and the leggings I wore to bed the previous night. What last spring felt like isolation’s small silver lining — a break from the societal demands of presentability, a chance for eyelashes to regrow and skin to reset after years of extensions and makeup — now feels like another way the pandemic is chipping away at the person I thought I was.

It’s not that I have anything against sweatpants. I’m not a Grinch who hates comfort. I just liked them a lot more when I had a reason to wear anything else. Without dinner parties, concerts, weddings, conferences, happy hours, business trips, coffee dates, vacations, or countless other social activities, there aren’t many occasions left for which to dress.

I understand that, for some people, it’s freeing not to worry about what to wear or whether this thing goes with that. For a sea of others, including me, it’s been destabilizing: Looking at my closet, many of the pieces I once carefully selected now feel like they belong to another life.

Fashion, for all its flaws, can be joyful and creative; it can make us feel like we’re part of a community. I wonder, sometimes, if that same joy, creativity, and community will still be there on the other side. And while this time of isolation could be a rare opportunity for all of us to figure out who we are when we truly dress for ourselves, for me, dressing up at all feels futile when there’s nowhere to go and no one to see.

Style, after all, doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Clothes are a form of self-expression, but they are also central to our identity because they shape how others see us, says Carolyn Mair, a behavioral psychologist and author of The Psychology of Fashion. Our brains are designed to form split-second judgments based on appearance. For better or worse, she says, our external selves — including the clothes we wear — are “the gatekeeper to being liked or disliked, being wanted or unwanted.”

“We have a sense of identity ourselves by what we’re trying to project, and our identity is also reinforced through the feedback of others,” Mair says.

This may help explain why, while fashion may not rank high on everyone’s list of what’s been lost during the pandemic, for some it has felt like a significant blow.

On social media, celebrities and everyday users alike have bemoaned how the pandemic has laid waste to their style.

“I’ve forgotten the purpose of 90% of my clothing. Only like 3 shirts even make sense any more,” radio host Jess McIntosh tweeted.

“There used to be an organizational axiom that if you haven’t worn a piece of clothing in 6 months, it’s time to get rid of it,” replied one follower. “Except that now describes literally every piece of clothing in my closet, all of my accessories, and most of my shoes.”

For comedian Ashley Nicole Black, the style crisis hit in October. “Am I the only one? After six months of working from home I have... no idea what my personal style is anymore? How do I like to dress? I like... comfortable.... that’s all I’ve got,” she tweeted.

And in one meme that went viral in December — comedian Lorena Pages’s “love it, couldn’t wear it” — Sofia Vergara, Shay Mitchell, an internet-famous greyhound, and thousands of other Instagram and TikTok users lamented a year of unworn looks.

With nowhere to wear party dresses or high heels — or even “hard pants,” for that matter — these clothes have piled up in warehouses, leaving brands and retailers grappling with the question of what to do with so much excess inventory. So many people are at home reevaluating their wardrobes and looking to make some money off the many pieces they no longer wear that resale sites have seen a flood of supply; no telling whether there’s enough demand to meet it.

Claudia Stevens, a hairstylist in Toronto, Canada, says she was always a very intentional shopper before the pandemic. She could go whole seasons without buying anything new because the pieces in her wardrobe were classic and felt so her. After salons closed last spring and the city went into lockdown, though, that relationship started to shift. Suddenly, nothing she tried on felt right. At first, she chalked it up to pandemic weight gain — maybe, she thought, it was just that her clothes literally didn’t fit right — but then she noticed the same sensation even with pieces that draped perfectly.

“I just didn’t feel connected to that part of who I was,” she says. “And when I would try to put something together the same way I would have [before lockdown], it’s like the second those pieces hit my body, I felt almost strangled.”

The fashion industry, which once dictated what we’d all be wearing a full season in advance, is experiencing its own existential crisis. Many designers have taken the opportunity of the pandemic to slow down the pace of their collections, produce fewer styles, and sync up the deliveries of seasonal pieces like coats and swimsuits with the arrival of fall and summer, respectively, rather than putting them on sale months in advance.

When Katrina Orsini moved home to her parents’ house in Connecticut last March, she expected to be there for a few months. She’d lost her job in events and, with no paycheck coming in, broke the lease on her Brooklyn apartment, packed a bag with a few basics — T-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants — and put the rest of her belongings in storage. It didn’t take long before the erosion of her sense of physical identity — the absence of the lipstick she usually wore even on trips to the bodega, the jeans and heels she’d sealed away — started to get to her.

“I’m a huge lipstick person,” she says. “And I went through this phase when [people started wearing] masks where I was trying everything to hold on to that.”

Armed with various shades of lipstick-colored embroidery thread, she made masks embroidered with lips and a nose ring like her own. Still sensing a void, she tried painting her nails and watched the polish chip away without anyone else ever seeing it. She accumulated a collection of wigs — some blonde, some colorful, always with the strong blunt bangs she’s never been bold enough to try for real — and, before beginning her job as an adjunct last month at Parsons School of Design, she was consumed with the idea of wearing a different wig each week to virtual class. At least, she reasoned, the wigs would add variety and a sense of change, the exact things life in semi-lockdown is sorely lacking.

Denied our usual outlets for self-expression, we’re all finding our own ways to cope. Jasmyn, a Chicago gamer who also goes by the handle CakePop, found herself missing the joy and excitement of getting ready for a night out with friends. She was strict about staying safe in quarantine, and her work attire (first scrubs, then work-from-home sweats) didn’t lend itself to self-expression, so she turned to Animal Crossing. The ultra-popular Nintendo Switch game allows users to design their characters’ outfits or style them in a nearly endless array of wardrobe options.

“A lot of people set up their character’s look and they’ll change it every so often,” says Jasmyn. “I change clothes every day that I play the game. So when I open the game, I go to my closet in my Animal Crossing house and I put together a different outfit before I go about my island chores.”

In the real world, with salons due to reopen once Covid-19 case numbers are low enough, Stevens is wrestling with how she’ll get dressed every day, especially in an industry where there’s an expectation to look the part.

“I can’t imagine going back to work and picking anything from that wardrobe. It’s so foreign to me right now,” she says. “I wear all of those things now and I’m like, ‘What the?’ It feels heavy and strange and kind of makes me think, ‘Who was I really dressing for?’”

It’s not lost on us that this question of whose gaze we’re courting as we get ready for the day is one that only tends to be asked of women. Even in lockdown, when the only eyeballs many of us regularly encounter are those of our partners, families, or pets, it’s the absence of others’ gaze that can throw us off balance.

“It’s weird for that to be then taken away so abruptly,” says Orsini. “I still now, a year later, am thinking about what it is I actually love about lipstick.”

The lack of visibility can be positive for some women, says Mair, especially those who have been disadvantaged by societal beauty norms. Ideally, it can mean we’re judged on our thoughts or contributions instead of what we look like. “All the values that I think are far more important than appearance in real terms can come to the fore,” she says.

On the other hand, humans are visual creatures — as much as half of our brains are dedicated to processing visual information. When we don’t have opportunities to present ourselves to the world and receive feedback, we lose an important tool for negotiating and clarifying our identity.

This isn’t only true for people who have spent the past year at home: Essential workers who have spent the pandemic in scrubs and uniforms also haven’t have had the chance to do their makeup or put on their favorite shoes for a night out to remind themselves of who they are outside their grueling jobs.

Jessica LaVoy, a bartender in Chicago, says that between work and quarantine, she’s spent most of the past year in either a uniform or sweatpants, a fact that’s taken a toll on her self-esteem. With bars now open again where she lives, the only feedback she’s getting is from the older men who come into the bar.

“I’m getting hit on all the time, which can be very uncomfortable,” she says. “I would much rather take a look in the mirror and see myself in my favorite H&M shirt, going out to hang out with my friends, knowing that I look good for myself.”

That feeling of self-confidence is hard to come by in isolation. And even after this is over, the comfort of a favorite outfit no longer feels a given: What if your favorite shirt isn’t your favorite anymore once going out with friends is safe again?

For now, I’ve found solace in this: I may now have no use for 90 percent of the shoes I own, but I can raid my girlfriend’s beanie collection and wear a new color every week. Salons may be a distant memory, but I can touch up my hair with purple Manic Panic at home.

And while I don’t know who we’ll be or what we’ll wear on the other side, I can only hope it involves more bedazzled blazers.

The Covid-19 pandemic in the United States has decelerated from its winter peak. On January 8, the country saw more than 300,000 new cases — a single-day record. Also on January 8, the US peaked at nearly 250,000 cases a day based on a weekly rolling average, according to Our World in Data.

As of February 24, the US is averaging a little more than 68,000 new Covid-19 cases every day. Hospitalizations have also decreased (to about 54,000 patients currently hospitalized, down from a peak of 130,000 in mid-January), as have deaths.

The improvement in the pandemic is significant. It’s likely attributable to a combination of people staying home after the winter holidays and more Americans gaining protection against future infection (whether through infection or vaccination).

The big question now is whether we’re seeing the beginning of the end. As more people are vaccinated, will this downward trajectory continue, or even accelerate? Or will case numbers start to level off and stay high (relative to most of 2020) for months?

The progress should be celebrated. Hospitalizations and deaths, arguably the more important metrics, are also way down. As more people get vaccinated, those numbers should continue to fall, as the approved vaccines have proven exceptionally effective at preventing the most serious illness. The US is now averaging about 1.3 million shots every day; with some improvement, the country may be able to deliver enough shots to reach herd immunity by the fall, according to some rough estimates.

But there are already signs that some states, particularly in the Northeast, are beginning to see cases plateau. A plateau would mean a more drawn-out final stage of the pandemic until widespread protection is reached — and more sickness and death than we’d see if cases keep falling. And it was a very real fear for the half-dozen public health experts I spoke with for this story.

“I think that you could call it an endgame, but it might take a long time,” Bill Hanage, a Harvard epidemiologist, told me. “I think we have passed the worst of the pandemic, but there is the potential for local bushfires to spring up.”

Experts worry people will relax their social distancing or mask-wearing too quickly, giving the virus more opportunities to spread. The more infectious new variants will continue to become more dominant and could exacerbate community transmission if people stop taking precautions.

Still, the general attitude I detected from epidemiologists is one of guarded optimism that the pandemic is entering its last stage — paired with anxiety that these final months could be more painful than need be if people get complacent.

“We need to take the pandemic seriously and not let up on our prevention efforts,” Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “At least until our case numbers are much lower than they are now.”

Cases are going down nationally. But the decline may be tapering off.

The national numbers speak for themselves: The US is now seeing about one-fourth as many daily new cases as it was six weeks ago.

But that progress is more a representation of just how bad things got in December and January than it is an acceptable level of infection on its own terms. Right now, the national caseload is at roughly the same level as in the weeks before Election Day, which nobody would have called acceptable at the time. As Vox’s German Lopez has reported, every state in the country except for one — Hawaii — still has too many daily new Covid-19 infections, according to benchmarks set by experts.

“We’re still far from being out of the woods,” Tara Smith, a professor at the Kent State University College of Public Health, told me. “It’s better than where we were for late fall and early winter, but not nearly back to our lowest level of spread.”

National data can also obscure some of the important trends happening at the regional and state levels, where experts see indications that cases are not falling with the same speed.

Look at the Northeast: The average number of daily new cases dropped from 28,000 on February 1 to 19,400 on February 14. But the improvement seems to be slowing down in the back half of the month, with new cases in the region hovering right around 16,000 as of February 23. Cases have actually risen in Connecticut and Rhode Island over the past week. And while case numbers are going down a bit in several states in the region, including New York, Massachusetts, and Maine, the declines have been smaller than in other parts of the country.

“The Northeast in general appears to be settling down into a plateau,” Hanage said. Yet those states are pushing ahead with reopening: Massachusetts is moving into a new phase, allowing indoor performance spaces to hold events at 50 percent capacity. New York is now permitting more indoor dining.

Several experts told me they are also watching Florida, where the new B.1.1.7 variant is spreading rapidly and Gov. Ron DeSantis has been generally lax about social distancing and mask measures throughout the pandemic. New cases are down just 12 percent in the last week, and the state has one of the higher rates of new cases per capita outside of the Northeast.

So, there are already some potential trouble spots worth watching. But fortunately, the country has some important things working in its favor that could prevent these outbreaks from spiraling out of control again.

The reasons for optimism about the pandemic winding down

The way the Covid-19 pandemic ultimately ends is the virus runs out of people to infect. Every day, more Americans are gaining protection from the coronavirus, making it more difficult for it to spread.

There are the 28.4 million people who have had a confirmed case of Covid-19, for starters — likely an undercount, however, given the inadequate testing in the United States. A study published in JAMA last month estimated that, as of mid-November, the real number of infections had reached 46.9 million, a number that would have only grown since then.

In addition, roughly 45 million Americans have received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which gives them some level of protection against the virus. We are nowhere near herd immunity yet (generally thought to mean at least 60 percent of the population has protection against the virus, and we may need closer to 70 or 80 percent for a virus as infectious as SARS-CoV-2), but the number of people who are vulnerable to the coronavirus is shrinking.

People may also be socially distancing more than they did around Thanksgiving and Christmas, when indoor gatherings seemed to drive the winter surge. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson observed, public health officials have cited Google mobility data showing less movement as one likely explanation for the downturn in cases. People may be nervous about the surge or the variants, but other factors might be in play, too, such as a normal post-holiday lull, or the bad weather across much of the country. The result is the same: The reduction in activity means fewer opportunities for people to spread the virus to one another.

Polling also continues to show most Americans say they are wearing masks every time they leave their house. These behaviors are hopefully having the desired effect and helping to lower transmission.

“We’re reaping some benefit from changes to individual behaviors and policies that occurred during and after the December and January surge in cases,” Michaud told me, “which eventually helped drive down transmission through things like greater adherence to masking and social distancing in many places.”

The warming weather should also work in our favor. While scientists still don’t perfectly understand how seasonality affects Covid-19’s spread, hotter temperatures will make it easier for people to gather outside, where the virus has a harder time moving from person to person.

The reasons for concern that the US will enter a long plateau

Experts still worry the end of the Covid-19 pandemic will be more protracted than necessary if local officials and individuals are too cavalier about resuming public activities and relaxing social distancing.

The problem starts with how many people are still susceptible to the virus. If we combine the numbers above on real infections and vaccinations, somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 million to 120 million Americans probably have some immunity to the coronavirus. But that still leaves 200 million people who don’t.

Yet people and politicians may look at the dropping case numbers and, after a year of quarantine and economic turmoil, be eager to get life back to normal as soon as possible. It’s a pattern we saw last year, when states started reopening businesses even while public health experts warned the virus wasn’t contained. The dips didn’t last and cases rose again.

Recent policy changes, such as New York City’s plan to permit movie theaters to hold screenings at limited capacity and Iowa lifting its mask mandate, suggest that the country might repeat the same cycle over the next few months.

“The risks come from reopening too soon and removing mask and distancing requirements,” Smith said. “I’m worried about complacency as cases decrease. It seems we haven’t yet learned the lessons of the pandemic, that if you start trying to return to ‘normal’ too soon, cases creep back up again.”

Any slowdown in the vaccination campaign would also lengthen the pandemic. For now, there is plenty of demand for the vaccines and more supply on the way. People seem to be growing more comfortable with the idea of getting the vaccine.

But the US may reach a point, before too long, when it has more shots than people willing to take them. David Celentano, who leads the epidemiology department at Johns Hopkins, said that if 20 percent to 30 percent of Americans remain hesitant about getting the vaccines, “we are in for trouble.”

So to keep up momentum, we need to remain vigilant about wearing masks and maintaining distance when we’re with people outside our household. We need to stick to outdoor activities as the weather makes them more palatable. And we need to keep getting our vaccines in order to keep building toward the herd immunity that will eventually bring the pandemic under control and allow life to return to normal.

Several of the experts I spoke with said they saw autumn as the critical moment in the pandemic. If over the summer we can keep cases suppressed while continuing to vaccinate people at a high rate, by the time the weather turns, the situation could be very different from 2020. Smith told me she had hope for a “normal-ish” late summer and fall.

“One of the best-case scenarios is that next fall, this will be like the flu,” Hanage said. “I think that will have been a good place to have reached.”

2021-02-26 11:45:52+00:00,9,"In the fall, Devika Chopra, a gynecologist in Mumbai, got a notice from municipal authorities asking to fill out a form with personal information and the number of people who worked at her clinic.

As a health care worker, she and millions of her colleagues in India would be first in line for a Covid-19 vaccine. In January, she got an SMS message saying she had an appointment for her shot. She received her first dose of Covishield, the local name for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, at the end of last month. This weekend, she received an SMS and a call, and, on Monday, got her second dose.

“It was very systematic, and it was really well organized,” Chopra told me a few weeks after her first shot.

“In fact,” she added, “I think it’s the best vaccination drive that I have seen in the country.”

India still has a long way to go before it can fully appraise its Covid-19 vaccination campaign, a staggering effort that began last month. The nation of more than 1.3 billion is undertaking what may be the world’s largest vaccination push.

India has given out more than 12 million doses of two approved Covid-19 vaccinations since the rollout began January 16. At its start, India had one of the fastest rollouts in the world by sheer number of people who got injections, vaccinating 1 million people in six days. But in a country of its size, it is like the tip of the tip of the pin.

The pace has slowed since, driven by a combination of factors, from glitches with the country’s vaccination app to vaccine hesitancy, fueled by what some critics have said was a hasty vaccine approval process that lacked transparency and a dramatic decline in Covid-19 cases in India, after some of the highest infection rates in the world.

The immunization drive has also not yet entered its next phase, in which people over 50 and those with underlying conditions — some 270 million people — will be eligible.

Still, the country has set an ambitious goal of vaccinating about 300 million people by this summer, nearly one United States-worth of inoculations.

“But it’s only one-fourth” of India’s entire population, K. Viswanath, a professor of health communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told me. “Just the sheer scale is very daunting.”

If any country could pull it off, though, it might be India. It has undertaken mass vaccination campaigns before, as with polio, though experts say inoculating adults presents different challenges than that effort, which focused on children. India also regularly conducts the world’s biggest elections, and is drawing on that experience and infrastructure to help its Covid-19 immunization push. And India, sometimes known as the world’s medicine cabinet, has the production and manufacturing capabilities to make vaccines — and export them to the rest of the world.

So far, though, the vaccination campaign has been underwhelming. Right now, less than 1 percent of India’s population is vaccinated, an untenable pace if India wants to give two Covid-19 doses to hundreds of millions of people by summer.

Many people I spoke to believe the capacity is there, and that any of India’s early stumbles are just “teething issues,” as a few experts put it. But whatever challenges it might face, India’s campaign is unlike any other, both for its size and the diversity of areas it’s trying to reach.

“The Covid-19 vaccine program in India is one of the most ambitious vaccine campaigns in the world,” Brian Wahl, an India-based epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me.

India’s experience with mass inoculations and elections is key

Before India launched its vaccination campaign on January 16, it did some dry runs, holding mock vaccination drives across the country to test the logistics of delivering doses and the technology used to track and monitor vaccine appointments. The run-through even included dummy vaccines, to fully train health care workers.

When it comes to mass vaccination programs, these are muscles India has used before, if not at this incredible scale. The country has undertaken large-scale immunization campaigns before, most notably against polio. It also has a strong universal immunization program to deliver vaccines to children and pregnant women across its vast population.

Those undertakings meant that India already had in place a lot of the infrastructure required to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to different states and populations, including rural areas.

The country has established “cold chain” points to safely transport, store, and deliver vaccines that require low temperatures. Indian officials say they have approximately 29,000 cold chain points and 41,000 deep freezers for vaccines (though the country isn’t using the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which require extreme cold storage).

“We have an advantage of having a structure in place, with cold chains and deliveries and vaccination centers and trained staff — so that’s the big, big plus point,” said Naveen Thacker, executive director of the International Pediatric Association and former representative to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance’s board.

This already-in-place health infrastructure meant that unlike some countries — the United States, for instance — India isn’t really setting up massive vaccination centers in places like sports stadiums. It’s largely relying on a built-in network of hospitals and clinics as the hubs. “It is not an ‘If you build it, they will come’ approach — what they’re doing is actively going to where people are,” Viswanath told me.

India is also drawing from its experience holding elections, the world’s biggest. The democratic process spans weeks, and polling places and election officials go where the people are, no matter how remote — even if it requires airlifting officials up a mountain or into a forested valley to record someone’s vote.

India last voted in 2019, and the country is using its voter rolls to identify people eligible to receive the vaccine. It is also deploying some of the same infrastructure, techniques, and even personnel in the inoculation drive: A security guard who normally stands watch at a voting booth may now instead guard vaccines.

Narendra Kumar Arora, executive director of INCLEN Trust International, an international clinical epidemiology network, and chair of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines under India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, said India is relying on this critical combination of health and election infrastructure to deliver vaccines to its population.

When it comes to mass vaccination campaigns, these are muscles India has used before

“The location of the immunization center is driven by the map used for election booths, and the other requirement is driven by health systems’ previous experience,” Arora told me.

Right now, India is targeting front-line workers for vaccination: about 10 million or so doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals, and about 20 million others like police officers and sanitation workers.

India hasn’t fully deployed its vaccination infrastructure, though it is picking up the pace, or “getting warmed up,” as Arora put it. India launched its drive with about 3,000 immunization centers. As of last week, it was up to about 10,000. Over the coming weeks it will scale up to between 50,000 and 100,000 immunization centers.

But the warming-up period does look disappointing on paper — especially when taking into account India’s vaccination know-how. To reach its goal of vaccinating 300 million people by summer, India will have to succeed at inoculating around 1.5 million people daily. In a little more than a month since the campaign started, the country had just cracked 12 million doses total.

And a question right now is whether India really is just warming up for this undertaking, or if the sluggish start is a warning of bigger problems ahead.

Want a vaccine? India has an app for that. But does it work?

As much as India is relying on its long-built expertise on immunizations, the government is also launching a new system: its Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network, or CoWIN, app.

CoWIN is a digital platform for the vaccination campaign. People will register with the app, and through that they’ll receive communication when they’re eligible to get their first, and second, shot. CoWIN will also help India track the vaccinations, keep track of vials in cold storage, and figure out how many doses to allocate to different places. It’s meant to provide real-time monitoring of the immunization campaign.

But the system has had its fair share of glitches, some of which may be stalling the vaccination drive.

Technical problems meant people weren’t getting messages about their appointments to get vaccinated. The MIT Technology Review spoke to one physician who got a message intended for someone else. The system itself was slow in loading information required to verify who was getting a vaccine.

It also wasn’t particularly nimble: If someone didn’t show up for their appointment, it was difficult to fill those slots, or have people sign up for cancellations. Hospitals had to adjust and allow for walk-ins to overcome some of the issues. The app has been crashing, too.

Health officials in several Indian states faced problems when trying to schedule second-dose appointments using the app, as the software didn’t recognize that people had already gotten their first shots. According to the Times of India, because of issues with the app last week, only 25 percent of those eligible for a second dose were able to get a shot in Maharashtra; in Mumbai, only 4 percent of a little more than 1,900 people got their second shot.

And this is all before CoWIN has been made available to the general public. Right now, the app is relying on ready-made lists of health care and front-line workers, who are the only ones getting a shot. This is a manageable number of people whose credentials are pretty easy to verify and who probably know better than most how and where to get a vaccine.

The goal of the CoWIN app is to get the general public to register for vaccinations, and “that facility will be opened up once the program is more confident about the performance,” Arora said, about resolving some of those “last-mile glitches.”

But even then, there are concerns about how well the app will work for a mass vaccination campaign. In the United States, seniors in particular have struggled with using some of the digital vaccine appointment platforms, and some experts fear that could be replicated in India. People may not be able to navigate the app, or become frustrated with it if it is glitchy, and those people may give up altogether.

Health officials will still use other sources to identify those eligible including voter rolls, medical records, and other documentation. Door-knocking — a tried-and-true method for vaccination campaigns, especially in India — will also supplement CoWIN’s self-registration. Such a massive campaign requires a wide range of strategies, but a lot does seem to hinge on this technology.

Beyond that, there are privacy concerns, since the CoWIN app will include identifying documents, including India’s equivalent of a Social Security number. Fake CoWIN apps have also cropped up in various app stores, raising fears of scams and misinformation.

And all of this may contribute to India’s other major problem with its vaccine rollout so far: vaccine hesitancy.

The biggest hurdle may be vaccine hesitancy, and India may take some of the blame

Ritika Aggarwal, a psychologist in Mumbai, got her first dose of the Covishield vaccine in February, a little less than a month after India began its vaccination campaign.

She didn’t want to get the shot immediately, and said she was a little nervous. Some of her worry was over having tuned out the news a little bit, and her desire to get more information.

“I waited for a lot of the doctors to take it and give me their feedback,” Aggarwal told me. “Then a lot of discussion with family in terms of whether should I go, or should I not?”

Aggarwal did go. She was anxious up until she received the injection at the local hospital. After her dose, she saw the informational posters and the reading material that explained the process and the potential side effects. Once she left the hospital, she said, “I was perfectly fine. I think once it was just in motion, the anxiety completely settled.”

Aggarwal is relieved to have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine — even if, as she points out, she’ll still have to be vigilant. But her anxiety isn’t unusual for India’s front-line workers, many of whom, like her, want the vaccine but have concerns about which ones are available.

India has approved two vaccines for emergency use. One, Covishield, is the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine being produced by the Serum Institute of India (which is also producing that vaccine for much of the rest of the world).

The other is Covaxin, developed by the Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. But Covaxin was approved before it completed its phase 3 clinical trials, so it lacks full efficacy and safety data — a dearth of transparency criticized by many prominent Indian experts and physicians.

“This vaccine, when it received the regulatory emergency approval, was still and continues to be in the phase 3 stage. So there were no data for efficacy. So that was the primary concern,” Malini Aisola, co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), an organization that promotes equitable access to medicines, told me. Aisola said experts and scientists have also questioned the basis on which the vaccine was given the emergency approval.

As Aggarwal told me, she wasn’t sure she wanted to get a vaccine that was still in the study phase, though she ended up being able to get Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine. Indian media have reported similar phenomena, with health care workers more reluctant to get Covaxin and overall turnout for the vaccine much lower than anticipated.

According to the Guardian, a few days after the vaccination drive began, overall turnout was about 64 percent of what was initially expected, with attendance much lower in certain states, like Punjab, which only had 22 percent of expected turnout. All of that has dragged down India’s vaccination numbers.

“One of the factors in the early vaccine hesitancy or resistance that some health care workers had could have been that some felt they could hold out for a few months more, by which time perhaps efficacy data would become available,” Aisola said.

As Aisola explained, Indian regulators have imposed certain safeguards around the use of Covaxin, and there is close monitoring of anyone who receives the dose. Recipients also get follow-up phone calls and have to keep a diary for several days — all of which makes sense, but may be, as she pointed out, “another source of anxiety.”

More transparency would help build public confidence in the vaccines, whether it is Covaxin or Covishield. “It would also really help the government in its own objective of trying to have a successful vaccination drive, because people will be able to see that the government is really in their corner in terms of protecting their safety by sharing the information transparently,” Aisola said.

And she and other experts pointed out it will help squash the inevitable rumors and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Otherwise, the worst-case scenario might occur, where legitimate concerns about transparency around vaccines merge with outright misinformation, confusing people and deterring them from taking any vaccine.

Uptake among front-line workers has increased, with about two-thirds of all health care workers now vaccinated, according to Arora. He credits additional outreach around safety and efficacy.

But the struggles for turnout also could be a warning sign, if the very people who’ll be delivering the vaccines to everyone else are themselves hesitant to get the injection. After all, the health care workers are the advocates, the examples for everyone in the vaccination drive. They’re also very likely to be the ones vaccinating others.

India is also struggling with the same viral misinformation around Covid-19 and the vaccines that other countries are dealing with. India, in particular, has seen disinformation spread across social media channels, particularly through WhatsApp.

“You can prepare everything, but you can never judge people’s minds,” the International Pediatric Association’s Thacker said. “And we live in a very small world, so whatever happens in South Africa, US, UK, Spain, Italy, immediately reaches to India.”

Another element possibly contributing to vaccine hesitancy: India’s relative good fortune of having a more manageable pandemic right now. India has recorded the most Covid-19 cases of any country behind the United States, with more than 150,000 deaths. But cases began falling since a peak in September, swiftly and somewhat perplexingly, and have remained comparatively low since.

That’s a great thing overall, of course. But experts worry that low case counts, combined with vaccine questions, might make it much harder to convince Indians that it’s urgent they get a shot.

“When you don’t see cases on a daily basis, it makes demand-generation that much more difficult,” said Wahl, the India-based epidemiologist. And vaccination is “still critical — no country is out of the weeds yet — and having the greatest proportion of your population protected is super important.”

All of this is going to make it harder for India to achieve the goals of its vaccination drive — though Thacker told me the country still has the capacity to hit that goal of vaccinating 300 million by summer. “If we are able to tackle this infodemic and communication challenge,” he said, “India can deliver.”

Health workers I spoke to in India said they’ve heard from patients that they have concerns — they want to get the vaccine, but they are concerned about side effects. Chopra, the doctor who now is fully vaccinated, said that when talking to patients, she acknowledges that there are uncertainties, but she encourages people to trust the process. She is direct about the possibility of side effects. She posted a detailed account of her own vaccination experience, documenting the exact symptoms she felt in the hours after each dose. A sore arm, she posted, was the worst of her second shot.

And, of course, not everyone needs convincing to get the Covid-19 vaccine. They are eager for the next phase of India’s campaign to begin.

“Most of my in-laws, and my parents, friends — everyone’s only question is, when are they going to roll it out for us?” Aggarwal said. “They’re all just waiting for the vaccine.”",voxdotcom,"['indias', 'country', 'india', 'app', 'health', 'covid19', 'campaign', 'vaccine', 'vaccination', 'million', 'unlike', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-26 03:27:07+00:00,7,"The good news is that the rate of Covid-19 vaccinations in the United States is increasing, while the rates of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are slowing. As of this week, more than 66 million doses have been administered to at least 42 million Americans, about 13 percent of the population.

But the disease is still spreading, and there aren’t yet enough vaccine doses to meet demand. And many who need a vaccine the most are having the hardest time getting one.

From signing up for appointments to securing transportation to clinics, many of the people at the highest risk for severe outcomes and death from Covid-19 — older adults, essential workers, and minority communities — are having trouble getting vaccinated when it’s their turn. At the same time, some wealthier people or people at lower risk have gamed vaccine registration systems to get to the head of the line.

“A lot of my older patients are struggling to figure out how to do it in general,” said Margot Savoy, chair of the family and community medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. “We’ve made it so complicated.”

Right now, the priority for many states is scale. Some are setting up mass vaccination sites at public venues like stadiums to get as many shots into arms as possible, as fast as possible. However, some health experts argue that in addition to going big, communities should also go small, working through local clinics and community groups in order to reach the most vulnerable. It may come at the expense of speed, but it would help ensure equity in who’s getting vaccinated for Covid-19.

Vaccinating the most vulnerable people requires active outreach

No community or demographic has been spared from the Covid-19 pandemic. More than half a million Americans have died from the disease, and many more have gotten sick. But some groups are getting hit harder than others, and it’s not just the elderly.

“Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus,” wrote Youyou Zhou and Vox’s Julia Belluz in a recent piece. “They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black.”

These same groups are also less likely to interact with the existing health care system and are more likely to face impediments when seeking the vaccine. Technology is one barrier that’s emerged in several states. For example, the online booking system for vaccine appointments in Arizona seems to be favoring some groups over others.

“When appointments become available, it’s like a gold rush,” said Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association and a former state health official. “If you work at a grocery store or don’t have wifi, you’re at a big, big disadvantage.”

Arizona has set up mass vaccination sites around major metropolitan areas. That’s helping the state boost its numbers — about 15 percent of its population has now been vaccinated — but many of its most vulnerable people haven’t been able to sign up for the limited appointment slots during the few short hours when they’re open. Some also aren’t able to drive to these sites from their homes, according to Humble.

“The effect of that [mass vaccination strategy] was yes, it did speed up the administration of vaccine, but it also has disproportionately served high-income people,” Humble said. “What vaccinators tell me is they are vaccinating Teslas and Tahoes all day.”

According to a Kaiser Family Foundation assessment on February 18, about 12 percent of Arizona’s white population has been vaccinated so far against Covid-19, compared with 4 percent of Black people, 3 percent of Hispanic people, and 9 percent of Asian people.

Another issue for Arizona, like in many states, is that remote regions may not have the resources to administer both of the Covid-19 vaccines that are currently available in the US. While the Moderna vaccine has less stringent freezer demands, the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine requires ultra-cold storage, so it’s being allocated mainly to larger counties that have the facilities to store it.

Humble said that one way to improve the system would be to have a one-time sign-up and then a weighted lottery to allocate appointments, so people with fast fingers, fast internet connections, and free time wouldn’t have such an overwhelming advantage.

But getting to some of the most vulnerable also requires active outreach. “We’re doing a real grassroots approach to this, which requires us going to the communities ... literally knocking on doors,” said Tomas Ramos, the founder of the Bronx Rising Initiative, a group helping vaccinate Bronx residents against Covid-19. “What I get when I knock on the door and speak to an elder, they just don’t even know when to start. That’s where we come in.”

Bronx Rising Initiative is working on raising funds for local clinics to increase capacities for Covid-19 vaccination, and also for setting up remote vaccination sites in public housing. In addition, the group is seeking out seniors and other vulnerable people to sign up for vaccine appointments, following up with reminders and helping them arrange transportation if needed.

Many of the initiative’s volunteers are from the Bronx, too. And that helps build trust, fight vaccine misinformation, and coax reluctant Bronxites to get immunized.

“We are from the community, so when [volunteers] knock on the door, [residents] see someone that lives in the same community talking to them about it,” Ramos said.

Local health clinics can close gaps in vaccinations, but they need doses first

Many communities around the country have had months to set up their programs to administer Covid-19 vaccines. But supplies remain limited, and there is a frustrating lack of information about when they’ll be replenished.

“We have the whole infrastructure to give it,” said Julie Vaishampayan, the public health officer for Stanislaus County in California. “We’re getting it out into pretty good arms, but we’re not getting it out to every eligible arm and we’re not quite sure who we’re missing.”

Another complication is that local health officials have to jump through hoops to order vaccines from the county, state, or federal government. And it’s not always transparent where these vaccines are going, so health workers on the front lines don’t have much time to prepare. When vaccines do arrive, local health officials have to identify eligible recipients, round them up for appointments, administer the shots before they expire, and keep track of patients to make sure they get their second doses. There can be overlap between different areas of health coverage, so even if someone is a perfect candidate for a vaccine, it can be hard to tell which group or agency is in change giving them a shot.

“I can’t see the vaccine that’s coming from the federal government or the state government,” Vaishampayan said. “I don’t know who it’s going to. I don’t know how many doses they’ve received. I don’t know how many doses they’ve given. It makes it really difficult to set up a network or providers who are going to reach your population.”

A central information hub that tells local health officials how vaccines will be allocated up to a week in advance would go a long way toward optimizing distribution, according to Vaishampayan. Currently, many health departments have to deal with much shorter lead times for receiving vaccines.

One potential bit of good news is that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson may get emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration this weekend. Not only would a third vaccine help bolster the supplies, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose instead of two and can be stored at ordinary refrigerator temperatures.

That vaccine would be particularly suited to smaller family practices and community clinics, which are less likely to have ultra-cold freezers. These types of facilities may have a lower throughput of vaccinations (since they are equipped to handle fewer patients and may not have the facilities to stockpile vaccines), but they may be able to better identify the people in greatest need of a Covid-19 vaccine.

Having a one-dose Covid-19 vaccine that can be stored in an ordinary medical refrigerator would allow these clinics to join in and expand the scope of the vaccination campaign.

“When we get to that vaccine, all of sudden there is a real opportunity for the average family doc or primary care person,” said Savoy. “If we ever had a vaccine to actually distribute and had one we could have at the practice and store it, we would have a whole network of people ready to go.”",voxdotcom,"['failing', 'weve', 'clinics', 'campaigns', 'complicated', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'reach', 'health', 'vaccination', 'doses', 'community', 'getting', 'dont', 'vulnerable', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 19:10:32+00:00,9,"More than 50 million Americans have now gotten their first shot against Covid-19, and 25 million have gotten two shots. There’s strong evidence that the two Covid-19 vaccines Americans are getting — one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other by Moderna — are highly effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite that fact, public health officials and media outlets have been warning that vaccinated people need to behave largely how they did before they were vaccinated. That’s because we don’t know as much about the vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing transmission to others. A vaccinated person may be well-protected from Covid-19, but if they carry the virus, could they possibly infect the people around them?

But a growing body of evidence suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines do, in fact, cut down on viral transmission. Two recent studies show some pretty favorable results — one from the UK that found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut down by 86 percent someone’s chances of developing an infection that they could pass along, the other a study in Israel that found an 89.4 percent reduction (though it should be noted that the Israeli study has yet to be fully released). These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

In other words, even as we wait for more definitive studies on the vaccines’ effects on transmission, more and more scientists think we do have enough information to feel pretty good about the vaccines’ capacity to give us back a semblance of normalcy as we approach a year of life in a pandemic.

In an opinion piece, Johns Hopkins epidemiologists M. Kate Grabowski and Justin Lessler argued, “We are confident vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the chances of transmitting the virus.”

“I have been very cautious due to limited evidence on transmission effects but agree with [Grabowski and Lessler] that a large transmission effect is the best explanation of the limited evidence to date,” Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in February.

In a new preprint, he and Harvard epidemiologist Rebecca Kahn laid out some principles for how to evaluate data from observational studies like the UK and Israel ones. Applying their principles to Moderna data (more on this below), they estimate that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.”

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has sounded an optimistic note. “The looming question is, if the person who’s been vaccinated gets infected, does that person have the capability to transmit it to another person? Some studies are pointing in a very favorable direction,” he said in a White House briefing in mid-February.

Studying exactly how much a vaccine affects transmission is very difficult. It requires exceptionally good contact tracing, which few countries have, or inference from lots of different forms of limited evidence. Uncertainty remains about exactly how much the vaccines reduce transmission — and that uncertainty has led many public health officials to be cautious in their public statements.

But that cautiousness can end up misleading the public, giving people the impression that scientists have no information at all. That, in turn, could also lead to vaccine hesitancy. Some people may think, if I get vaccinated but I still have to continue masking and social distancing at all times, then why get vaccinated at all?

“In their own lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend to be cleareyed about the vaccines. Many are getting shots as soon as they’re offered one. They are urging their family and friends to do the same,” David Leonhardt argues in a New York Times piece. “But when they speak to a national audience, they deliver a message that comes off very differently. It is dominated by talk of risks, uncertainties, caveats and possible problems. It feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation and anxiety.”

The vaccines do reduce transmission. They do take us a big step closer toward life beyond the pandemic. And the messaging from our institutions should start reflecting that.

The two new studies looking at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, explained

Now that many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 — about 50 million in the US — new research is coming out every day that clarifies the transmission picture. Two key new studies look at the rate of disease among people who got two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. That’s an important figure for judging how effective vaccines are for transmission — the lower the rate of infection, the lower the rate of transmission.

A little step back here to explain where things stand on vaccines: There are several vaccines approved in different parts of the world, with various approaches and levels of effectiveness. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were the first to be approved for use in the US, and there’s more data available about them, and to keep the scope of this piece manageable, it will focus on just those two vaccines.

A working paper recently published with The Lancet’s preprint publication program looked at health care workers in the United Kingdom who were vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It finds that the vaccine doesn’t just make people less likely to get symptomatic infections (which we already knew from Pfizer/BioNTech’s initial trials) — it also makes them much much less likely to get infected at all. “Vaccine effectiveness was 72% ... 21 days after first dose and 86% ... 7 days after the second dose,” the study concludes.

That’s lower than the 95 percent headline number you might have seen, but that 95 percent measures symptomatic infections; this measures all infections, even “invisible” asymptomatic ones, through routine testing of healthy people.

Another recent paper, this time out of Israel, looked at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well. (A big caveat: The findings were announced in a press release, but the study itself hasn’t been released yet.) It found a drop of 89.4 percent in infections among people who got two doses of the vaccine, compared to unvaccinated people. We don’t have as much information from this research as we’d like yet, as the paper has yet to be made public, and given the methodological challenges of estimating transmission, the details of the paper matter a lot. But that number is similar to the one from the UK study.

Even though the studies focused only on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there’s reason to believe that the results translate to the Moderna vaccine as well. The two vaccines work very similarly. Both contain a set of instructions to the RNA in our cells to build a protein very similar to the “spike protein” in the coronavirus. Then the immune system notices the intruder and responds, producing antibodies that’ll protect against the coronavirus later.

Because the two vaccines work very similarly, the researchers I spoke to said it was overwhelmingly likely that they both block transmission to a similar degree. As a result, we can assume — though with some uncertainty — that evidence of strong infection reductions from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also likely applies to Moderna.

But even before the most recent research came out, we already knew that the vaccines would help curb transmission. For one thing, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines reduce the chances of getting a symptomatic case of Covid-19 by 94 percent and 95 percent, respectively. That is a promising starting point — if a person doesn’t get Covid-19, then they can’t pass it on.

But what about asymptomatic cases?

In their initial clinical trials, Moderna and Pfizer didn’t study whether vaccinated people got asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 — that is, people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not suffer any symptoms. However, when people went in for their second shot, Moderna did give them a nasal swab test for Covid-19. In a supplement to its submission to the FDA, Moderna says that 14 of the 14,134 vaccinated people had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time) and 38 of the 14,073 people in the control group had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time).

That rules out one big worry about the vaccines: that they might make Covid-19 mild in vaccinated people — so mild they don’t experience any symptoms — without actually preventing it. Instead, it was clear from back in December that the vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection as well as reducing symptomatic infection.

Using Moderna’s nasal swab test data, infectious disease biologist Marm Kilpatrick at UCSC estimated that the vaccine, after a single shot, reduces a person’s odds of infection with Covid-19 by up to 90 percent. (When I emailed him, we determined that with some more pessimistic assumptions, the reduction might be more like 78 to 88 percent.)

Lipsitch and Kahn took a different approach, and estimated from the same data that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.” Of course, the overall efficacy of the vaccine after both doses will almost certainly be higher.

The recent data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel and in the UK backs up that idea. It suggests that after two shots, the vaccine is 85 to 90 percent effective at preventing infection with Covid-19.

There are some caveats. The data from the UK and from Israel comes from observational studies, not randomized controlled trials: If the people who’d been vaccinated differ from people who haven’t, the study’s assumptions might not hold. Researchers do their best to adjust for this, but any adjustment will be imperfect. In addition, getting the vaccine could change behavior — the vaccinated might take more risks, and they might be less likely to seek Covid-19 testing or be required to provide negative test results.

So this estimate shouldn’t be considered definitive. But it lines up with other sources of evidence, and it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is likely highly effective — in the 80 to 90 percent range — at preventing infections. And low infection rates mean low transmission rates.

Viral load and reduced odds of transmission

But let’s say a person who has been vaccinated still gets infected with Covid-19. That’s not great, but the vaccine likely continues to protect the people around them, according to the research so far. That’s because of another consideration: viral load — that is, how much virus can be measured in a patient’s nose and throat.

Not everyone who has Covid-19 is equally likely to transmit it. A study recently published in The Lancet based on research from contact tracing in Spain has found a very strong association between viral load and how many other people the patient infects, as well as how serious the infections in other people are.

This isn’t very surprising. Viral load determines how much virus you are coughing or breathing into the air, which determines whether other people get sick. And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

Don’t go bar-hopping, but having also-vaccinated friends over is likely fine, Dr. Leana Wen of the George Washington School of Public Health argues in the Washington Post. Letting your grandparents hold your kids? Families might reasonably conclude that’s also fine, she says.

Vaccinated people should, of course, respect businesses’ rules about masks — the essential workers asked to enforce those rules have no way to know if you’ve been vaccinated. And while most people are still unvaccinated, the vaccinated should be thoughtful about protecting those who haven’t had a chance at the vaccines yet. But those reminders shouldn’t drown out an accurate understanding of the fact that the vaccines are really effective.

“Advising people that they must do nothing differently after vaccination — not even in the privacy of their homes — creates the misimpression that vaccines offer little benefit at all. Vaccines provide a true reduction of risk, not a false sense of security,” epidemiologist Julia Marcus argued in the Atlantic.

Our recommendations for vaccinated people should reflect our best current understanding of the evidence.

It’s true that there’s still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of the vaccines on transmission. It’s possible that as we learn more from Israel, recommendations will change. And it’s important that people get fully vaccinated — two shots, plus some time for the immunity to fully take hold — before they assume the vaccine has fully protected them and the people around them.

But what’s important to remember is that we aren’t operating from complete ignorance. We know a lot about the vaccines, and what we know points toward them being very effective at reducing transmission and protecting those around us. If you’re hesitant about taking the vaccine because you heard that it might not protect others, you shouldn’t be, because the evidence suggests it does. That message is at least as important as warnings for the vaccinated not to “party.”

Correction, February 24: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who have received the Covid-19 vaccine. Sixty-four million doses had been administered as of the 24th, but since the vaccines approved so far are administered in two doses, 44 million people had received at least one dose by that date.",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'explained', 'vaccinated', 'pfizerbiontech', 'growing', 'study', 'transmission', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'viral', 'reduce', 'data', 'evidence', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 13:30:11+00:00,17,"The good news is that the rate of Covid-19 vaccinations in the United States is increasing, while the rates of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are slowing. As of this week, more than 66 million doses have been administered to at least 42 million Americans, about 13 percent of the population.

But the disease is still spreading, and there aren’t yet enough vaccine doses to meet demand. And many who need a vaccine the most are having the hardest time getting one.

From signing up for appointments to securing transportation to clinics, many of the people at the highest risk for severe outcomes and death from Covid-19 — older adults, essential workers, and minority communities — are having trouble getting vaccinated when it’s their turn. At the same time, some wealthier people or people at lower risk have gamed vaccine registration systems to get to the head of the line.

“A lot of my older patients are struggling to figure out how to do it in general,” said Margot Savoy, chair of the family and community medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. “We’ve made it so complicated.”

Right now, the priority for many states is scale. Some are setting up mass vaccination sites at public venues like stadiums to get as many shots into arms as possible, as fast as possible. However, some health experts argue that in addition to going big, communities should also go small, working through local clinics and community groups in order to reach the most vulnerable. It may come at the expense of speed, but it would help ensure equity in who’s getting vaccinated for Covid-19.

Vaccinating the most vulnerable people requires active outreach

No community or demographic has been spared from the Covid-19 pandemic. More than half a million Americans have died from the disease, and many more have gotten sick. But some groups are getting hit harder than others, and it’s not just the elderly.

“Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus,” wrote Youyou Zhou and Vox’s Julia Belluz in a recent piece. “They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black.”

These same groups are also less likely to interact with the existing health care system and are more likely to face impediments when seeking the vaccine. Technology is one barrier that’s emerged in several states. For example, the online booking system for vaccine appointments in Arizona seems to be favoring some groups over others.

“When appointments become available, it’s like a gold rush,” said Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association and a former state health official. “If you work at a grocery store or don’t have wifi, you’re at a big, big disadvantage.”

Arizona has set up mass vaccination sites around major metropolitan areas. That’s helping the state boost its numbers — about 15 percent of its population has now been vaccinated — but many of its most vulnerable people haven’t been able to sign up for the limited appointment slots during the few short hours when they’re open. Some also aren’t able to drive to these sites from their homes, according to Humble.

“The effect of that [mass vaccination strategy] was yes, it did speed up the administration of vaccine, but it also has disproportionately served high-income people,” Humble said. “What vaccinators tell me is they are vaccinating Teslas and Tahoes all day.”

According to a Kaiser Family Foundation assessment on February 18, about 12 percent of Arizona’s white population has been vaccinated so far against Covid-19, compared with 4 percent of Black people, 3 percent of Hispanic people, and 9 percent of Asian people.

Another issue for Arizona, like in many states, is that remote regions may not have the resources to administer both of the Covid-19 vaccines that are currently available in the US. While the Moderna vaccine has less stringent freezer demands, the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine requires ultra-cold storage, so it’s being allocated mainly to larger counties that have the facilities to store it.

Humble said that one way to improve the system would be to have a one-time sign-up and then a weighted lottery to allocate appointments, so people with fast fingers, fast internet connections, and free time wouldn’t have such an overwhelming advantage.

But getting to some of the most vulnerable also requires active outreach. “We’re doing a real grassroots approach to this, which requires us going to the communities ... literally knocking on doors,” said Tomas Ramos, the founder of the Bronx Rising Initiative, a group helping vaccinate Bronx residents against Covid-19. “What I get when I knock on the door and speak to an elder, they just don’t even know when to start. That’s where we come in.”

Bronx Rising Initiative is working on raising funds for local clinics to increase capacities for Covid-19 vaccination, and also for setting up remote vaccination sites in public housing. In addition, the group is seeking out seniors and other vulnerable people to sign up for vaccine appointments, following up with reminders and helping them arrange transportation if needed.

Many of the initiative’s volunteers are from the Bronx, too. And that helps build trust, fight vaccine misinformation, and coax reluctant Bronxites to get immunized.

“We are from the community, so when [volunteers] knock on the door, [residents] see someone that lives in the same community talking to them about it,” Ramos said.

Local health clinics can close gaps in vaccinations, but they need doses first

Many communities around the country have had months to set up their programs to administer Covid-19 vaccines. But supplies remain limited, and there is a frustrating lack of information about when they’ll be replenished.

“We have the whole infrastructure to give it,” said Julie Vaishampayan, the public health officer for Stanislaus County in California. “We’re getting it out into pretty good arms, but we’re not getting it out to every eligible arm and we’re not quite sure who we’re missing.”

Another complication is that local health officials have to jump through hoops to order vaccines from the county, state, or federal government. And it’s not always transparent where these vaccines are going, so health workers on the front lines don’t have much time to prepare. When vaccines do arrive, local health officials have to identify eligible recipients, round them up for appointments, administer the shots before they expire, and keep track of patients to make sure they get their second doses. There can be overlap between different areas of health coverage, so even if someone is a perfect candidate for a vaccine, it can be hard to tell which group or agency is in change giving them a shot.

“I can’t see the vaccine that’s coming from the federal government or the state government,” Vaishampayan said. “I don’t know who it’s going to. I don’t know how many doses they’ve received. I don’t know how many doses they’ve given. It makes it really difficult to set up a network or providers who are going to reach your population.”

A central information hub that tells local health officials how vaccines will be allocated up to a week in advance would go a long way toward optimizing distribution, according to Vaishampayan. Currently, many health departments have to deal with much shorter lead times for receiving vaccines.

One potential bit of good news is that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson may get emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration this weekend. Not only would a third vaccine help bolster the supplies, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose instead of two and can be stored at ordinary refrigerator temperatures.

That vaccine would be particularly suited to smaller family practices and community clinics, which are less likely to have ultra-cold freezers. These types of facilities may have a lower throughput of vaccinations (since they are equipped to handle fewer patients and may not have the facilities to stockpile vaccines), but they may be able to better identify the people in greatest need of a Covid-19 vaccine.

Having a one-dose Covid-19 vaccine that can be stored in an ordinary medical refrigerator would allow these clinics to join in and expand the scope of the vaccination campaign.

“When we get to that vaccine, all of sudden there is a real opportunity for the average family doc or primary care person,” said Savoy. “If we ever had a vaccine to actually distribute and had one we could have at the practice and store it, we would have a whole network of people ready to go.”",voxdotcom,"['failing', 'weve', 'clinics', 'campaigns', 'complicated', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'reach', 'health', 'vaccination', 'doses', 'community', 'getting', 'dont', 'vulnerable', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 10:51:05+00:00,44,"The Food and Drug Administration is working through thousands of pages of documentation for an emergency authorization of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which could come through this month. Most states are gradually expanding vaccine eligibility, production of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is increasing, and new studies show good results for additional vaccine candidates as well.

The news on the Covid-19 vaccine front of late has been quite good — perhaps so good that our perspective on the fight against the pandemic may be getting a little warped.

Case in point: the media coverage and public reception of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Results from its trials were released last week. According to the company, it should be able to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of this year. But this good news hasn’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanied announcements about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Perhaps that’s because in its clinical trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy number — the percentage of cases prevented entirely — of 66 percent. Compared against the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine and the 94.1 rate for Moderna’s, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine simply doesn’t look as good.

But in another sense, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial results were incredibly encouraging. The same trial showed that J&J’s vaccine makes Covid-19 cases much milder, meaning you might still get sick but you are much less likely to be hospitalized or die. Indeed, on that front, the J&J vaccine performs just as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, a fact that seems to have been undersold in news coverage about it.

To put J&J’s effectiveness in another context, think about the flu. Flu vaccines mostly don’t prevent you from getting sick with the flu but instead make the flu much less awful if you catch it and less fatal for at-risk populations. A Covid-19 vaccine that was similar to that — one that made you much less likely to be hospitalized or die, and made the disease milder — would still be enough to help bring the pandemic to an end and give us back our lives.

That’s exactly what we have with the current crop of vaccines, including the three that haven’t been received as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. No one who got two doses in clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines has been hospitalized or died, and the same holds true for the new vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Novavax (which haven’t yet been approved in the US). Each of the vaccines has demonstrated very high protection against severe Covid-19 in trials.

So why aren’t we talking about that?

How “efficacy” became the measure of vaccine success

The vaccines developed against Covid-19 can protect people in three ways. First, they can make the vaccinated person less likely to catch the disease. That’s called “efficacy.” It’s the number that made the headlines when Pfizer and Moderna results came out this fall — 95 percent and 94.1 percent efficacy, respectively. For every 20 people in the control group to develop symptoms of Covid-19, only one in the vaccinated group did.

That’s an incredible achievement, and it’s what’s gotten most of the attention in the reporting on the vaccines. But it has overshadowed discussion of the other two ways a vaccine against Covid-19 can protect people.

The second is that the vaccines seem to make vaccinated people less likely to transmit the disease; new research suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do this, too, though imperfectly (so you should still be cautious around unvaccinated people).

And the third way the vaccines can protect people is by ensuring that when a vaccinated person does get the disease, they experience a mild case and are not likely to require hospitalization or be at risk of dying.

This last finding is a big deal. As long as vaccines can make sure that Covid-19, even if you get it, isn’t very bad, we can use them to chart our way out of the pandemic. But this effect of the vaccines has been largely neglected.

Now, there’s a reason headlines have focused on the efficacy of preventing all disease rather than severe disease: It’s what the earliest clinical trials were primarily set up to study.

Every clinical trial defines in advance a primary clinical endpoint: the outcome researchers are primarily focused on studying. The study is designed to have a large enough sample size to detect differences in this primary outcome between the trial group and the placebo group. For the vaccine trials, the primary clinical endpoint has largely been symptomatic Covid-19 infection (however mild or severe), or, in some cases, a positive Covid-19 PCR test.

It makes sense for the studies to set that endpoint. Designing a study to measure rare events like hospitalization or death is much harder than designing a study to measure relatively common events like infection. Covid-19 is a scary disease, but less than 1 percent of people who get it will die from it. That means that a study designed with death from Covid-19 as a primary clinical endpoint would need to be enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of participants. Pinning down the exact frequency of rare events requires a lot of data, and vaccine developers could only include so many people in their first clinical trials because recruiting and coordinating participants is expensive and time-consuming.

So instead, most studies primarily measure how many cases of Covid-19 the vaccines prevent. They do collect data on hospitalizations and deaths, but it’s not the primary outcome their studies are designed to measure, and that has been reflected in press releases, media coverage, and the popular understanding of how well the vaccines work.

As it happens, that data on hospitalizations and deaths looks really good. Indeed, there have been zero cases of hospitalization or death in clinical trials for all of these vaccines. But we hear about that less partly because the studies weren’t designed with that outcome in mind.

This focus on preventing cases, rather than preventing cases as well as hospitalizations and deaths, may have led to the sentiment that the new, unapproved vaccines are worse, and that it’s okay that the US isn’t expediting their approval and distribution because people would rather get the better vaccines anyway. This line of reasoning would be understandable if some vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death and some are only 60 percent effective. But in this instance, it’s a mistake, since all of the vaccines are indistinguishably effective by this metric.

The focus on studying efficacy, instead of studying hospitalization and death, affects major policy calls.

South Africa suspended its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a new study found that the vaccine had very low — potentially zero — efficacy against the variant strain of the disease that predominates in the country. Obviously, that finding was really bad news for the AstraZeneca vaccine. But less widely broadcast was the fact that no one in the study got seriously ill or was hospitalized from Covid-19 (no one in the placebo group did, either; the study was small and didn’t contain at-risk people).

Now, let’s be clear: While other studies have convincingly demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against hospitalization and death, it seems to work less well against the South African virus variant, and that might well mean it works less well to prevent hospitalization and death as well. One crucial caveat here is that the study population was young; we would not have expected many hospitalizations or any deaths within that age group. So it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine has very limited usefulness against the new strain. Or it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers very strong protection against severe disease from the new strain. The study was not set up to answer that question, so we simply don’t know.

In that regard, South Africa’s decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout based on the discouraging data makes some sense. But countries that have focused on hospitalization and death statistics, rather than efficacy statistics, have made the opposite call.

“I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, defending Britain’s continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Countries face tough choices here, and their leaders would be able to make a vastly more informed decision if there had been a study with sufficient statistical power — a lot more participants — to detect whether the vaccine is protecting against hospitalization and death. As it is, the understandable focus on efficacy simply doesn’t give us much information on this essential question.

The communications challenge of vaccine statistics

In the past few weeks, some public health experts have started working to change the conversation on vaccines to focus on the key hospitalization and death numbers. One person leading this effort is Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tweeted on January 31:

Am often asked about different vaccines and their efficacy



Each trials tracks, reports efficacy differently



Currently, we have preliminary results for Novavax and J&J



But what numbers matter? What should you look for?



Here's one set of data to track. In a simple table pic.twitter.com/9m2OBgqcla — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) February 1, 2021

One note about this data: It refers only to the clinical trials. Now that the vaccine is out in the world, we’re getting real-world data. The news is still good: 700,000 people in Israel have been vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and there have in fact been a few hospitalizations — 16, to be precise, for a rate of 0.002 percent — and no deaths.

Jha’s message was widely shared, but efficacy still continues to be the statistic that people fixate on.

Communications about severe disease and hospitalization face an uphill battle. Efficacy is much easier to explain — do you get sick or not? For severe disease, on the other hand, many studies have slightly different benchmarks for severity. And while right now there have been zero hospitalizations and zero deaths by anyone vaccinated in the clinical trials for any of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, it doesn’t mean those outcomes are guaranteed. (Again, in Israel, 0.002 percent have been hospitalized so far — that’s very, very low, but it’s not zero.)

Furthermore, as the pandemic stretches into its second year, we’re all desperate for certainty. “This study simply didn’t collect enough data to tell us what we hoped to learn” is not the answer any of us are looking for. The efficacy of the vaccines is known; their effectiveness against hospitalization and death is known to be very high but not pinned down for certain, especially not against the South African variant. All of those pose extraordinary challenges for public health officials and the media to communicate.

But a shift from a focus on efficacy to a focus on improved outcomes is essential for good vaccine decision-making. Moderna and Pfizer can’t produce enough mRNA vaccines alone to end the pandemic, so the public embrace of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — and potentially the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which we’re waiting to learn more on — might make a huge difference for whether things start to get back to normal in the US in April or in August. That’s a difference of potentially hundreds of thousands of lives lost.",voxdotcom,"['important', 'looking', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'clinical', 'johnson', 'disease', 'study', 'statistic', 'hospitalization', 'death', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 04:36:05+00:00,19,"In the fall, Devika Chopra, a gynecologist in Mumbai, got a notice from municipal authorities asking to fill out a form with personal information and the number of people who worked at her clinic.

As a health care worker, she and millions of her colleagues in India would be first in line for a Covid-19 vaccine. In January, she got an SMS message saying she had an appointment for her shot. She received her first dose of Covishield, the local name for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, at the end of last month. This weekend, she received an SMS and a call, and, on Monday, got her second dose.

“It was very systematic, and it was really well organized,” Chopra told me a few weeks after her first shot.

“In fact,” she added, “I think it’s the best vaccination drive that I have seen in the country.”

India still has a long way to go before it can fully appraise its Covid-19 vaccination campaign, a staggering effort that began last month. The nation of more than 1.3 billion is undertaking what may be the world’s largest vaccination push.

India has given out more than 12 million doses of two approved Covid-19 vaccinations since the rollout began January 16. At its start, India had one of the fastest rollouts in the world by sheer number of people who got injections, vaccinating 1 million people in six days. But in a country of its size, it is like the tip of the tip of the pin.

The pace has slowed since, driven by a combination of factors, from glitches with the country’s vaccination app to vaccine hesitancy, fueled by what some critics have said was a hasty vaccine approval process that lacked transparency and a dramatic decline in Covid-19 cases in India, after some of the highest infection rates in the world.

The immunization drive has also not yet entered its next phase, in which people over 50 and those with underlying conditions — some 270 million people — will be eligible.

Still, the country has set an ambitious goal of vaccinating about 300 million people by this summer, nearly one United States-worth of inoculations.

“But it’s only one-fourth” of India’s entire population, K. Viswanath, a professor of health communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told me. “Just the sheer scale is very daunting.”

If any country could pull it off, though, it might be India. It has undertaken mass vaccination campaigns before, as with polio, though experts say inoculating adults presents different challenges than that effort, which focused on children. India also regularly conducts the world’s biggest elections, and is drawing on that experience and infrastructure to help its Covid-19 immunization push. And India, sometimes known as the world’s medicine cabinet, has the production and manufacturing capabilities to make vaccines — and export them to the rest of the world.

So far, though, the vaccination campaign has been underwhelming. Right now, less than 1 percent of India’s population is vaccinated, an untenable pace if India wants to give two Covid-19 doses to hundreds of millions of people by summer.

Many people I spoke to believe the capacity is there, and that any of India’s early stumbles are just “teething issues,” as a few experts put it. But whatever challenges it might face, India’s campaign is unlike any other, both for its size and the diversity of areas it’s trying to reach.

“The Covid-19 vaccine program in India is one of the most ambitious vaccine campaigns in the world,” Brian Wahl, an India-based epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me.

India’s experience with mass inoculations and elections is key

Before India launched its vaccination campaign on January 16, it did some dry runs, holding mock vaccination drives across the country to test the logistics of delivering doses and the technology used to track and monitor vaccine appointments. The run-through even included dummy vaccines, to fully train health care workers.

When it comes to mass vaccination programs, these are muscles India has used before, if not at this incredible scale. The country has undertaken large-scale immunization campaigns before, most notably against polio. It also has a strong universal immunization program to deliver vaccines to children and pregnant women across its vast population.

Those undertakings meant that India already had in place a lot of the infrastructure required to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to different states and populations, including rural areas.

The country has established “cold chain” points to safely transport, store, and deliver vaccines that require low temperatures. Indian officials say they have approximately 29,000 cold chain points and 41,000 deep freezers for vaccines (though the country isn’t using the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which require extreme cold storage).

“We have an advantage of having a structure in place, with cold chains and deliveries and vaccination centers and trained staff — so that’s the big, big plus point,” said Naveen Thacker, executive director of the International Pediatric Association and former representative to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance’s board.

This already-in-place health infrastructure meant that unlike some countries — the United States, for instance — India isn’t really setting up massive vaccination centers in places like sports stadiums. It’s largely relying on a built-in network of hospitals and clinics as the hubs. “It is not an ‘If you build it, they will come’ approach — what they’re doing is actively going to where people are,” Viswanath told me.

India is also drawing from its experience holding elections, the world’s biggest. The democratic process spans weeks, and polling places and election officials go where the people are, no matter how remote — even if it requires airlifting officials up a mountain or into a forested valley to record someone’s vote.

India last voted in 2019, and the country is using its voter rolls to identify people eligible to receive the vaccine. It is also deploying some of the same infrastructure, techniques, and even personnel in the inoculation drive: A security guard who normally stands watch at a voting booth may now instead guard vaccines.

Narendra Kumar Arora, executive director of INCLEN Trust International, an international clinical epidemiology network, and chair of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines under India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, said India is relying on this critical combination of health and election infrastructure to deliver vaccines to its population.

When it comes to mass vaccination campaigns, these are muscles India has used before

“The location of the immunization center is driven by the map used for election booths, and the other requirement is driven by health systems’ previous experience,” Arora told me.

Right now, India is targeting front-line workers for vaccination: about 10 million or so doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals, and about 20 million others like police officers and sanitation workers.

India hasn’t fully deployed its vaccination infrastructure, though it is picking up the pace, or “getting warmed up,” as Arora put it. India launched its drive with about 3,000 immunization centers. As of last week, it was up to about 10,000. Over the coming weeks it will scale up to between 50,000 and 100,000 immunization centers.

But the warming-up period does look disappointing on paper — especially when taking into account India’s vaccination know-how. To reach its goal of vaccinating 300 million people by summer, India will have to succeed at inoculating around 1.5 million people daily. In a little more than a month since the campaign started, the country had just cracked 12 million doses total.

And a question right now is whether India really is just warming up for this undertaking, or if the sluggish start is a warning of bigger problems ahead.

Want a vaccine? India has an app for that. But does it work?

As much as India is relying on its long-built expertise on immunizations, the government is also launching a new system: its Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network, or CoWIN, app.

CoWIN is a digital platform for the vaccination campaign. People will register with the app, and through that they’ll receive communication when they’re eligible to get their first, and second, shot. CoWIN will also help India track the vaccinations, keep track of vials in cold storage, and figure out how many doses to allocate to different places. It’s meant to provide real-time monitoring of the immunization campaign.

But the system has had its fair share of glitches, some of which may be stalling the vaccination drive.

Technical problems meant people weren’t getting messages about their appointments to get vaccinated. The MIT Technology Review spoke to one physician who got a message intended for someone else. The system itself was slow in loading information required to verify who was getting a vaccine.

It also wasn’t particularly nimble: If someone didn’t show up for their appointment, it was difficult to fill those slots, or have people sign up for cancellations. Hospitals had to adjust and allow for walk-ins to overcome some of the issues. The app has been crashing, too.

Health officials in several Indian states faced problems when trying to schedule second-dose appointments using the app, as the software didn’t recognize that people had already gotten their first shots. According to the Times of India, because of issues with the app last week, only 25 percent of those eligible for a second dose were able to get a shot in Maharashtra; in Mumbai, only 4 percent of a little more than 1,900 people got their second shot.

And this is all before CoWIN has been made available to the general public. Right now, the app is relying on ready-made lists of health care and front-line workers, who are the only ones getting a shot. This is a manageable number of people whose credentials are pretty easy to verify and who probably know better than most how and where to get a vaccine.

The goal of the CoWIN app is to get the general public to register for vaccinations, and “that facility will be opened up once the program is more confident about the performance,” Arora said, about resolving some of those “last-mile glitches.”

But even then, there are concerns about how well the app will work for a mass vaccination campaign. In the United States, seniors in particular have struggled with using some of the digital vaccine appointment platforms, and some experts fear that could be replicated in India. People may not be able to navigate the app, or become frustrated with it if it is glitchy, and those people may give up altogether.

Health officials will still use other sources to identify those eligible including voter rolls, medical records, and other documentation. Door-knocking — a tried-and-true method for vaccination campaigns, especially in India — will also supplement CoWIN’s self-registration. Such a massive campaign requires a wide range of strategies, but a lot does seem to hinge on this technology.

Beyond that, there are privacy concerns, since the CoWIN app will include identifying documents, including India’s equivalent of a Social Security number. Fake CoWIN apps have also cropped up in various app stores, raising fears of scams and misinformation.

And all of this may contribute to India’s other major problem with its vaccine rollout so far: vaccine hesitancy.

The biggest hurdle may be vaccine hesitancy, and India may take some of the blame

Ritika Aggarwal, a psychologist in Mumbai, got her first dose of the Covishield vaccine in February, a little less than a month after India began its vaccination campaign.

She didn’t want to get the shot immediately, and said she was a little nervous. Some of her worry was over having tuned out the news a little bit, and her desire to get more information.

“I waited for a lot of the doctors to take it and give me their feedback,” Aggarwal told me. “Then a lot of discussion with family in terms of whether should I go, or should I not?”

Aggarwal did go. She was anxious up until she received the injection at the local hospital. After her dose, she saw the informational posters and the reading material that explained the process and the potential side effects. Once she left the hospital, she said, “I was perfectly fine. I think once it was just in motion, the anxiety completely settled.”

Aggarwal is relieved to have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine — even if, as she points out, she’ll still have to be vigilant. But her anxiety isn’t unusual for India’s front-line workers, many of whom, like her, want the vaccine but have concerns about which ones are available.

India has approved two vaccines for emergency use. One, Covishield, is the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine being produced by the Serum Institute of India (which is also producing that vaccine for much of the rest of the world).

The other is Covaxin, developed by the Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. But Covaxin was approved before it completed its phase 3 clinical trials, so it lacks full efficacy and safety data — a dearth of transparency criticized by many prominent Indian experts and physicians.

“This vaccine, when it received the regulatory emergency approval, was still and continues to be in the phase 3 stage. So there were no data for efficacy. So that was the primary concern,” Malini Aisola, co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), an organization that promotes equitable access to medicines, told me. Aisola said experts and scientists have also questioned the basis on which the vaccine was given the emergency approval.

As Aggarwal told me, she wasn’t sure she wanted to get a vaccine that was still in the study phase, though she ended up being able to get Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine. Indian media have reported similar phenomena, with health care workers more reluctant to get Covaxin and overall turnout for the vaccine much lower than anticipated.

According to the Guardian, a few days after the vaccination drive began, overall turnout was about 64 percent of what was initially expected, with attendance much lower in certain states, like Punjab, which only had 22 percent of expected turnout. All of that has dragged down India’s vaccination numbers.

“One of the factors in the early vaccine hesitancy or resistance that some health care workers had could have been that some felt they could hold out for a few months more, by which time perhaps efficacy data would become available,” Aisola said.

As Aisola explained, Indian regulators have imposed certain safeguards around the use of Covaxin, and there is close monitoring of anyone who receives the dose. Recipients also get follow-up phone calls and have to keep a diary for several days — all of which makes sense, but may be, as she pointed out, “another source of anxiety.”

More transparency would help build public confidence in the vaccines, whether it is Covaxin or Covishield. “It would also really help the government in its own objective of trying to have a successful vaccination drive, because people will be able to see that the government is really in their corner in terms of protecting their safety by sharing the information transparently,” Aisola said.

And she and other experts pointed out it will help squash the inevitable rumors and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Otherwise, the worst-case scenario might occur, where legitimate concerns about transparency around vaccines merge with outright misinformation, confusing people and deterring them from taking any vaccine.

Uptake among front-line workers has increased, with about two-thirds of all health care workers now vaccinated, according to Arora. He credits additional outreach around safety and efficacy.

But the struggles for turnout also could be a warning sign, if the very people who’ll be delivering the vaccines to everyone else are themselves hesitant to get the injection. After all, the health care workers are the advocates, the examples for everyone in the vaccination drive. They’re also very likely to be the ones vaccinating others.

India is also struggling with the same viral misinformation around Covid-19 and the vaccines that other countries are dealing with. India, in particular, has seen disinformation spread across social media channels, particularly through WhatsApp.

“You can prepare everything, but you can never judge people’s minds,” the International Pediatric Association’s Thacker said. “And we live in a very small world, so whatever happens in South Africa, US, UK, Spain, Italy, immediately reaches to India.”

Another element possibly contributing to vaccine hesitancy: India’s relative good fortune of having a more manageable pandemic right now. India has recorded the most Covid-19 cases of any country behind the United States, with more than 150,000 deaths. But cases began falling since a peak in September, swiftly and somewhat perplexingly, and have remained comparatively low since.

That’s a great thing overall, of course. But experts worry that low case counts, combined with vaccine questions, might make it much harder to convince Indians that it’s urgent they get a shot.

“When you don’t see cases on a daily basis, it makes demand-generation that much more difficult,” said Wahl, the India-based epidemiologist. And vaccination is “still critical — no country is out of the weeds yet — and having the greatest proportion of your population protected is super important.”

All of this is going to make it harder for India to achieve the goals of its vaccination drive — though Thacker told me the country still has the capacity to hit that goal of vaccinating 300 million by summer. “If we are able to tackle this infodemic and communication challenge,” he said, “India can deliver.”

Health workers I spoke to in India said they’ve heard from patients that they have concerns — they want to get the vaccine, but they are concerned about side effects. Chopra, the doctor who now is fully vaccinated, said that when talking to patients, she acknowledges that there are uncertainties, but she encourages people to trust the process. She is direct about the possibility of side effects. She posted a detailed account of her own vaccination experience, documenting the exact symptoms she felt in the hours after each dose. A sore arm, she posted, was the worst of her second shot.

And, of course, not everyone needs convincing to get the Covid-19 vaccine. They are eager for the next phase of India’s campaign to begin.

“Most of my in-laws, and my parents, friends — everyone’s only question is, when are they going to roll it out for us?” Aggarwal said. “They’re all just waiting for the vaccine.”",voxdotcom,"['indias', 'country', 'india', 'app', 'health', 'covid19', 'campaign', 'vaccine', 'vaccination', 'million', 'unlike', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 04:35:06+00:00,4,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-25 03:48:03+00:00,19,"On a cold night in November, I bundled up in my coat and hat and gloves, and lugged a telescope into the backyard. I’d been given a serious mission, but first I allowed myself a few minutes of fun. I used the telescope to observe the Cigar Galaxy, the Dumbbell Nebula, Orion’s Belt. There they were, gleaming brightly in gold and blue and pink, steady friends in a painfully unsteady winter.

Then I got to work. I moved the telescope across the sky until I found my target: a near-Earth asteroid. Scientists didn’t know much about it except that it would threaten life on our planet if it ever collided with us. So they’d asked amateurs like me, who happen to live somewhere with a view of the passing asteroid, to observe it and record data on it.

I was using a new smart telescope called the Unistellar eVscope, which digitally strips out light pollution to produce stunning images and allows backyard astronomers to upload their data to scientists at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute. It was SETI that had sent me an alert asking me to please go out and look at the asteroid.

It didn’t look terribly impressive — just a blob tracing a line across my eyepiece as it flew through space. But I captured the data anyway and sent it to the scientists to analyze. It was after midnight when I finally went back inside and fell asleep wondering: What were the chances I’d discovered something that would actually help science?

I’m not alone in pursuing this kind of activity nowadays. The pandemic has driven a huge increase in participation in citizen science, where people without specialized training collect data out in the world or perform simple analyses of data online to help out scientists.

Stuck at home with time on their hands, millions of amateurs around the world are gathering information on everything from birds to plants to Covid-19 at the request of institutional researchers. And while quarantine is mostly a nightmare for us, it’s been a great accelerant for science.

Early in the pandemic, a firehose of data started gushing forth on citizen science platforms like Zooniverse and SciStarter, where scientists ask the public to analyze their data online. It’s a form of crowdsourcing that has the added bonus of giving volunteers a real sense of community; each project has a discussion forum where participants can pose questions to each other (and often to the scientists behind the projects) and forge friendly connections.

“There’s a wonderful project called Rainfall Rescue that’s transcribing historical weather records. It’s a climate change project to understand how weather has changed over the past few centuries,” Laura Trouille, vice president of citizen science at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago and co-lead of Zooniverse, told me. “They uploaded a dataset of 10,000 weather logs that needed transcribing — and that was completed in one day!”

Some Zooniverse projects, like Snapshot Safari, ask participants to classify animals in images from wildlife cameras. That project saw daily classifications go from 25,000 to 200,000 per day in the initial days of lockdown. And across all its projects, Zooniverse reported that 200,000 participants contributed more than 5 million classifications of images in one week alone — the equivalent of 48 years of research. Although participation has slowed a bit since the spring, it’s still four times what it was pre-pandemic.

Many people are particularly eager to help tackle Covid-19, and scientists have harnessed their energy. Carnegie Mellon University’s Roni Rosenfeld set up a platform where volunteers can help artificial intelligence predict the spread of the coronavirus, even if they know nothing about AI. Researchers at the University of Washington invited people to contribute to Covid-19 drug discovery using a computer game called Foldit; they experimented with designing proteins that could attach to the virus that causes Covid-19 and prevent it from entering cells.

Trouille said she’s not at all surprised to see so many people flocking to citizen science. Years back, Zooniverse surveyed participants to understand why they volunteered to spend so many hours sifting through data. Their top three reasons were wanting to contribute meaningfully to science, wanting to enjoy a pleasant distraction from everyday life, and wanting to be part of a supportive community.

Quarantine has intensified those drives. Many of us have longed to feel a sense of purpose, which experts on solitude say is vital for helping people get through isolation. We’ve often craved a distraction from the anxiety spiral of reading news about the coronavirus (not to mention politics and the economy), and looking at beautiful pictures of stars or animals can offer that. And we’ve all missed hanging out with people.

“People are just really needing to connect in meaningful ways,” Trouille said. “Welcoming online communities provide a wonderful outlet for that.”

How does citizen science work? What sorts of discoveries have people made?

If you’re new to citizen science, you might wonder how amateurs can start analyzing data without fear that they’re going to get it all wrong and ruin a scientific project. I definitely had this fear when I first started dipping my toes into it.

But it works because scientists break down complex tasks into micro-tasks that people without specialized training can do. Even if people get some classifications wrong, that’s fine because scientists aggregate many people’s classifications (Zooniverse gets 25 to 45 people to classify every image), relying on “wisdom-of-the-crowd” algorithms to arrive at an accurate result. A 2018 analysis showed that data collected by volunteers and scientists agreed 96 percent of the time.

So, for instance, when I opened the Zooniverse app on my phone and clicked on a project called Disk Detectives, it gave me a two-minute tutorial on how to identify stars with certain kinds of disks around them; these stars are more likely to have planets. Then I swiped through a bunch of images, jotting down whether I saw the disk or not. That’s all there was to it.

It’s so simple that at this point you’re probably wondering: Why don’t scientists just get computers to do this? Surely this is a task for AI?

Yes and no. Part of what people are doing when they classify data on these platforms is creating the training sets for AI — they’re teaching computers to recognize the patterns that they, the humans, can see. But, Trouille said, “Part of what the humans are doing that the AI will never be able to do is to identify the unusual or the weird.”

A delightful example of this arose on Galaxy Zoo, one of the astronomy projects on Zooniverse, soon after it launched in 2007. A participant noticed an unusual-looking bright green object and posted about it on the forum, asking if anyone had seen anything similar. Soon a whole discussion thread sprang up titled “Give peas a chance,” with participants calling themselves the “Peas Corps.” Together, they collected more than a hundred of these celestial objects.

Scientists eventually realized these were a special type of galaxy that had never been found before. They represent an important stage in galaxy evolution. In 2009, the scientists published a paper on them in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, crediting 10 citizen scientists from Galaxy Zoo for their contribution to the research.

“Because the research team didn’t know that type of galaxy existed, there would have been no reason to train the computer to look for that,” Trouille explained. “So you would never have found that unless you had hundreds of thousands of people looking at all that data and just able to flag the unusual and bring it to the discussion forum.”

She believes AI will become increasingly integrated into citizen science platforms, but that human abilities will always remain a valuable complement to it.

Katie Cohen, who researches citizen science at the UK’s Centre for Science and Policy, is a bit more skeptical about the irreplaceability of human pattern recognition. “With these kinds of [online] crowdsourcing exercises, I don’t know if they necessarily have long-term potential because technology is improving so rapidly,” she told me. “Whereas I think the community-oriented programs might be where more of the potential lies — because lived experience can’t be programmed through AI.”

She was referring to the citizen science projects that ask volunteers to go out into the field, whether to count birds in their backyard, test air quality in their neighborhood, tag monarch butterflies migrating through their city, or observe asteroids zipping across their patch of sky.

Franck Marchis, a SETI scientist and co-founder of Unistellar, explained why it’s so valuable to have multiple eyes scanning the heavens, rather than relying only on the few telescopes that NASA uses to detect asteroids.

“If you only have a telescope in Hawaii and it’s cloudy there, you’re not going to have observations,” he said. “And that’s happened already. We had an asteroid that we basically discovered at the last minute because for a week it was cloudy in Hawaii and nobody saw it. So the idea of our program is to have a worldwide network that’s coordinated … a network that’s capable of observing the sky 24/7.”

Can collaborative research rebuild the public’s trust in science?

At a time when public trust in experts has declined precipitously, some scientists are arguing that a more collaborative research model can help counter science skepticism. And governments are increasingly realizing that it may be worth investing in citizen science — not only to accelerate scientific research, but also to boost trust in it. Both the US and the European Union currently fund major programs in citizen science.

“I do think it has a lot of potential to really improve trust and relationships,” Cohen said. “That’s really why a lot of the policymakers that we work with are really interested in it across various UK government departments.”

The big question, she said, is what type of public involvement is most effective at improving trust. Most citizen science projects use volunteers for simple data collection or analysis aimed at helping professional researchers. But some seek to involve volunteers on a deeper level, putting them on almost equal footing with the researchers. One example of that, Cohen said, would be asking tobacco users to actually help design a study on how to minimize tobacco use.

An even more extreme example would be a “Citizens’ Assembly,” a group of randomly selected citizens that makes recommendations to their government on how to handle issues like the climate crisis. The idea of an assembly like this has gained ground in places like France and the UK. But this is definitely a more labor-intensive way to engage citizens than, say, a Zooniverse project, and it remains to be seen how well it’ll work.

In the meantime, many scientists, such as Marchis, don’t want the public to perceive them as elitists off in some ivory tower. “When science is not part of your life, it’s very easy to become against it because you don’t really understand exactly what those people called scientists are doing,” the astronomer told me. “My personal goal is that people consider science to be part of their life — not something you can do only if you have a PhD.”

I certainly don’t have a PhD in astronomy, but this winter I got to feel the thrill of participating in scientific discovery.

That night in November that I spent observing the near-Earth asteroid from the backyard? Turns out, 26 other amateurs — from America to Austria, from Finland to France — also peered through their telescopes in their backyards that night. Together, we obtained decisive data that allowed astronomers to model the asteroid’s shape. When they shared the shape with us in December — it looked like a potato — a huge grin spread across my face.

I was happy in part because I knew that scientists need this kind of data to divert asteroids from impacting Earth. But it was more than that. During the pandemic, I’ve barely been able to travel anywhere or see anyone. Yet somehow I’ve also traveled to an asteroid as it zooms past the planet, and to the Cigar Galaxy and the Dumbbell Nebula and Orion’s Belt, and I’ve connected with scientists and strangers who are trying to understand our universe a bit better and who are, despite the suffering that Covid-19 has wrought, finding this world to be full of beauty and awe.

2021-02-25 02:34:57+00:00,21,"More than 50 million Americans have now gotten their first shot against Covid-19, and 25 million have gotten two shots. There’s strong evidence that the two Covid-19 vaccines Americans are getting — one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other by Moderna — are highly effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite that fact, public health officials and media outlets have been warning that vaccinated people need to behave largely how they did before they were vaccinated. That’s because we don’t know as much about the vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing transmission to others. A vaccinated person may be well-protected from Covid-19, but if they carry the virus, could they possibly infect the people around them?

But a growing body of evidence suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines do, in fact, cut down on viral transmission. Two recent studies show some pretty favorable results — one from the UK that found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut down by 86 percent someone’s chances of developing an infection that they could pass along, the other a study in Israel that found an 89.4 percent reduction (though it should be noted that the Israeli study has yet to be fully released). These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

In other words, even as we wait for more definitive studies on the vaccines’ effects on transmission, more and more scientists think we do have enough information to feel pretty good about the vaccines’ capacity to give us back a semblance of normalcy as we approach a year of life in a pandemic.

In an opinion piece, Johns Hopkins epidemiologists M. Kate Grabowski and Justin Lessler argued, “We are confident vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the chances of transmitting the virus.”

“I have been very cautious due to limited evidence on transmission effects but agree with [Grabowski and Lessler] that a large transmission effect is the best explanation of the limited evidence to date,” Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in February.

In a new preprint, he and Harvard epidemiologist Rebecca Kahn laid out some principles for how to evaluate data from observational studies like the UK and Israel ones. Applying their principles to Moderna data (more on this below), they estimate that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.”

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has sounded an optimistic note. “The looming question is, if the person who’s been vaccinated gets infected, does that person have the capability to transmit it to another person? Some studies are pointing in a very favorable direction,” he said in a White House briefing in mid-February.

Studying exactly how much a vaccine affects transmission is very difficult. It requires exceptionally good contact tracing, which few countries have, or inference from lots of different forms of limited evidence. Uncertainty remains about exactly how much the vaccines reduce transmission — and that uncertainty has led many public health officials to be cautious in their public statements.

But that cautiousness can end up misleading the public, giving people the impression that scientists have no information at all. That, in turn, could also lead to vaccine hesitancy. Some people may think, if I get vaccinated but I still have to continue masking and social distancing at all times, then why get vaccinated at all?

“In their own lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend to be cleareyed about the vaccines. Many are getting shots as soon as they’re offered one. They are urging their family and friends to do the same,” David Leonhardt argues in a New York Times piece. “But when they speak to a national audience, they deliver a message that comes off very differently. It is dominated by talk of risks, uncertainties, caveats and possible problems. It feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation and anxiety.”

The vaccines do reduce transmission. They do take us a big step closer toward life beyond the pandemic. And the messaging from our institutions should start reflecting that.

The two new studies looking at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, explained

Now that many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 — about 50 million in the US — new research is coming out every day that clarifies the transmission picture. Two key new studies look at the rate of disease among people who got two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. That’s an important figure for judging how effective vaccines are for transmission — the lower the rate of infection, the lower the rate of transmission.

A little step back here to explain where things stand on vaccines: There are several vaccines approved in different parts of the world, with various approaches and levels of effectiveness. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were the first to be approved for use in the US, and there’s more data available about them, and to keep the scope of this piece manageable, it will focus on just those two vaccines.

A working paper recently published with The Lancet’s preprint publication program looked at health care workers in the United Kingdom who were vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It finds that the vaccine doesn’t just make people less likely to get symptomatic infections (which we already knew from Pfizer/BioNTech’s initial trials) — it also makes them much much less likely to get infected at all. “Vaccine effectiveness was 72% ... 21 days after first dose and 86% ... 7 days after the second dose,” the study concludes.

That’s lower than the 95 percent headline number you might have seen, but that 95 percent measures symptomatic infections; this measures all infections, even “invisible” asymptomatic ones, through routine testing of healthy people.

Another recent paper, this time out of Israel, looked at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well. (A big caveat: The findings were announced in a press release, but the study itself hasn’t been released yet.) It found a drop of 89.4 percent in infections among people who got two doses of the vaccine, compared to unvaccinated people. We don’t have as much information from this research as we’d like yet, as the paper has yet to be made public, and given the methodological challenges of estimating transmission, the details of the paper matter a lot. But that number is similar to the one from the UK study.

Even though the studies focused only on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there’s reason to believe that the results translate to the Moderna vaccine as well. The two vaccines work very similarly. Both contain a set of instructions to the RNA in our cells to build a protein very similar to the “spike protein” in the coronavirus. Then the immune system notices the intruder and responds, producing antibodies that’ll protect against the coronavirus later.

Because the two vaccines work very similarly, the researchers I spoke to said it was overwhelmingly likely that they both block transmission to a similar degree. As a result, we can assume — though with some uncertainty — that evidence of strong infection reductions from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also likely applies to Moderna.

But even before the most recent research came out, we already knew that the vaccines would help curb transmission. For one thing, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines reduce the chances of getting a symptomatic case of Covid-19 by 94 percent and 95 percent, respectively. That is a promising starting point — if a person doesn’t get Covid-19, then they can’t pass it on.

But what about asymptomatic cases?

In their initial clinical trials, Moderna and Pfizer didn’t study whether vaccinated people got asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 — that is, people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not suffer any symptoms. However, when people went in for their second shot, Moderna did give them a nasal swab test for Covid-19. In a supplement to its submission to the FDA, Moderna says that 14 of the 14,134 vaccinated people had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time) and 38 of the 14,073 people in the control group had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time).

That rules out one big worry about the vaccines: that they might make Covid-19 mild in vaccinated people — so mild they don’t experience any symptoms — without actually preventing it. Instead, it was clear from back in December that the vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection as well as reducing symptomatic infection.

Using Moderna’s nasal swab test data, infectious disease biologist Marm Kilpatrick at UCSC estimated that the vaccine, after a single shot, reduces a person’s odds of infection with Covid-19 by up to 90 percent. (When I emailed him, we determined that with some more pessimistic assumptions, the reduction might be more like 78 to 88 percent.)

Lipsitch and Kahn took a different approach, and estimated from the same data that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.” Of course, the overall efficacy of the vaccine after both doses will almost certainly be higher.

The recent data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel and in the UK backs up that idea. It suggests that after two shots, the vaccine is 85 to 90 percent effective at preventing infection with Covid-19.

There are some caveats. The data from the UK and from Israel comes from observational studies, not randomized controlled trials: If the people who’d been vaccinated differ from people who haven’t, the study’s assumptions might not hold. Researchers do their best to adjust for this, but any adjustment will be imperfect. In addition, getting the vaccine could change behavior — the vaccinated might take more risks, and they might be less likely to seek Covid-19 testing or be required to provide negative test results.

So this estimate shouldn’t be considered definitive. But it lines up with other sources of evidence, and it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is likely highly effective — in the 80 to 90 percent range — at preventing infections. And low infection rates mean low transmission rates.

Viral load and reduced odds of transmission

But let’s say a person who has been vaccinated still gets infected with Covid-19. That’s not great, but the vaccine likely continues to protect the people around them, according to the research so far. That’s because of another consideration: viral load — that is, how much virus can be measured in a patient’s nose and throat.

Not everyone who has Covid-19 is equally likely to transmit it. A study recently published in The Lancet based on research from contact tracing in Spain has found a very strong association between viral load and how many other people the patient infects, as well as how serious the infections in other people are.

This isn’t very surprising. Viral load determines how much virus you are coughing or breathing into the air, which determines whether other people get sick. And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

Don’t go bar-hopping, but having also-vaccinated friends over is likely fine, Dr. Leana Wen of the George Washington School of Public Health argues in the Washington Post. Letting your grandparents hold your kids? Families might reasonably conclude that’s also fine, she says.

Vaccinated people should, of course, respect businesses’ rules about masks — the essential workers asked to enforce those rules have no way to know if you’ve been vaccinated. And while most people are still unvaccinated, the vaccinated should be thoughtful about protecting those who haven’t had a chance at the vaccines yet. But those reminders shouldn’t drown out an accurate understanding of the fact that the vaccines are really effective.

“Advising people that they must do nothing differently after vaccination — not even in the privacy of their homes — creates the misimpression that vaccines offer little benefit at all. Vaccines provide a true reduction of risk, not a false sense of security,” epidemiologist Julia Marcus argued in the Atlantic.

Our recommendations for vaccinated people should reflect our best current understanding of the evidence.

It’s true that there’s still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of the vaccines on transmission. It’s possible that as we learn more from Israel, recommendations will change. And it’s important that people get fully vaccinated — two shots, plus some time for the immunity to fully take hold — before they assume the vaccine has fully protected them and the people around them.

But what’s important to remember is that we aren’t operating from complete ignorance. We know a lot about the vaccines, and what we know points toward them being very effective at reducing transmission and protecting those around us. If you’re hesitant about taking the vaccine because you heard that it might not protect others, you shouldn’t be, because the evidence suggests it does. That message is at least as important as warnings for the vaccinated not to “party.”

Correction, February 24: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who have received the Covid-19 vaccine.

2021-02-25 01:34:02+00:00,29,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-25 00:51:07+00:00,42,"The Food and Drug Administration is working through thousands of pages of documentation for an emergency authorization of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which could come through this month. Most states are gradually expanding vaccine eligibility, production of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is increasing, and new studies show good results for additional vaccine candidates as well.

The news on the Covid-19 vaccine front of late has been quite good — perhaps so good that our perspective on the fight against the pandemic may be getting a little warped.

Case in point: the media coverage and public reception of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Results from its trials were released last week. According to the company, it should be able to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of this year. But this good news hasn’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanied announcements about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Perhaps that’s because in its clinical trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy number — the percentage of cases prevented entirely — of 66 percent. Compared against the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine and the 94.1 rate for Moderna’s, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine simply doesn’t look as good.

But in another sense, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial results were incredibly encouraging. The same trial showed that J&J’s vaccine makes Covid-19 cases much milder, meaning you might still get sick but you are much less likely to be hospitalized or die. Indeed, on that front, the J&J vaccine performs just as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, a fact that seems to have been undersold in news coverage about it.

To put J&J’s effectiveness in another context, think about the flu. Flu vaccines mostly don’t prevent you from getting sick with the flu but instead make the flu much less awful if you catch it and less fatal for at-risk populations. A Covid-19 vaccine that was similar to that — one that made you much less likely to be hospitalized or die, and made the disease milder — would still be enough to help bring the pandemic to an end and give us back our lives.

That’s exactly what we have with the current crop of vaccines, including the three that haven’t been received as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. No one who got two doses in clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines has been hospitalized or died, and the same holds true for the new vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Novavax (which haven’t yet been approved in the US). Each of the vaccines has demonstrated very high protection against severe Covid-19 in trials.

So why aren’t we talking about that?

How “efficacy” became the measure of vaccine success

The vaccines developed against Covid-19 can protect people in three ways. First, they can make the vaccinated person less likely to catch the disease. That’s called “efficacy.” It’s the number that made the headlines when Pfizer and Moderna results came out this fall — 95 percent and 94.1 percent efficacy, respectively. For every 20 people in the control group to develop symptoms of Covid-19, only one in the vaccinated group did.

That’s an incredible achievement, and it’s what’s gotten most of the attention in the reporting on the vaccines. But it has overshadowed discussion of the other two ways a vaccine against Covid-19 can protect people.

The second is that the vaccines seem to make vaccinated people less likely to transmit the disease; new research suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do this, too, though imperfectly (so you should still be cautious around unvaccinated people).

And the third way the vaccines can protect people is by ensuring that when a vaccinated person does get the disease, they experience a mild case and are not likely to require hospitalization or be at risk of dying.

This last finding is a big deal. As long as vaccines can make sure that Covid-19, even if you get it, isn’t very bad, we can use them to chart our way out of the pandemic. But this effect of the vaccines has been largely neglected.

Now, there’s a reason headlines have focused on the efficacy of preventing all disease rather than severe disease: It’s what the earliest clinical trials were primarily set up to study.

Every clinical trial defines in advance a primary clinical endpoint: the outcome researchers are primarily focused on studying. The study is designed to have a large enough sample size to detect differences in this primary outcome between the trial group and the placebo group. For the vaccine trials, the primary clinical endpoint has largely been symptomatic Covid-19 infection (however mild or severe), or, in some cases, a positive Covid-19 PCR test.

It makes sense for the studies to set that endpoint. Designing a study to measure rare events like hospitalization or death is much harder than designing a study to measure relatively common events like infection. Covid-19 is a scary disease, but less than 1 percent of people who get it will die from it. That means that a study designed with death from Covid-19 as a primary clinical endpoint would need to be enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of participants. Pinning down the exact frequency of rare events requires a lot of data, and vaccine developers could only include so many people in their first clinical trials because recruiting and coordinating participants is expensive and time-consuming.

So instead, most studies primarily measure how many cases of Covid-19 the vaccines prevent. They do collect data on hospitalizations and deaths, but it’s not the primary outcome their studies are designed to measure, and that has been reflected in press releases, media coverage, and the popular understanding of how well the vaccines work.

As it happens, that data on hospitalizations and deaths looks really good. Indeed, there have been zero cases of hospitalization or death in clinical trials for all of these vaccines. But we hear about that less partly because the studies weren’t designed with that outcome in mind.

This focus on preventing cases, rather than preventing cases as well as hospitalizations and deaths, may have led to the sentiment that the new, unapproved vaccines are worse, and that it’s okay that the US isn’t expediting their approval and distribution because people would rather get the better vaccines anyway. This line of reasoning would be understandable if some vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death and some are only 60 percent effective. But in this instance, it’s a mistake, since all of the vaccines are indistinguishably effective by this metric.

The focus on studying efficacy, instead of studying hospitalization and death, affects major policy calls.

South Africa suspended its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a new study found that the vaccine had very low — potentially zero — efficacy against the variant strain of the disease that predominates in the country. Obviously, that finding was really bad news for the AstraZeneca vaccine. But less widely broadcast was the fact that no one in the study got seriously ill or was hospitalized from Covid-19 (no one in the placebo group did, either; the study was small and didn’t contain at-risk people).

Now, let’s be clear: While other studies have convincingly demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against hospitalization and death, it seems to work less well against the South African virus variant, and that might well mean it works less well to prevent hospitalization and death as well. One crucial caveat here is that the study population was young; we would not have expected many hospitalizations or any deaths within that age group. So it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine has very limited usefulness against the new strain. Or it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers very strong protection against severe disease from the new strain. The study was not set up to answer that question, so we simply don’t know.

In that regard, South Africa’s decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout based on the discouraging data makes some sense. But countries that have focused on hospitalization and death statistics, rather than efficacy statistics, have made the opposite call.

“I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, defending Britain’s continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Countries face tough choices here, and their leaders would be able to make a vastly more informed decision if there had been a study with sufficient statistical power — a lot more participants — to detect whether the vaccine is protecting against hospitalization and death. As it is, the understandable focus on efficacy simply doesn’t give us much information on this essential question.

The communications challenge of vaccine statistics

In the past few weeks, some public health experts have started working to change the conversation on vaccines to focus on the key hospitalization and death numbers. One person leading this effort is Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tweeted on January 31:

Am often asked about different vaccines and their efficacy



Each trials tracks, reports efficacy differently



Currently, we have preliminary results for Novavax and J&J



But what numbers matter? What should you look for?



Here's one set of data to track. In a simple table pic.twitter.com/9m2OBgqcla — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) February 1, 2021

One note about this data: It refers only to the clinical trials. Now that the vaccine is out in the world, we’re getting real-world data. The news is still good: 700,000 people in Israel have been vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and there have in fact been a few hospitalizations — 16, to be precise, for a rate of 0.002 percent — and no deaths.

Jha’s message was widely shared, but efficacy still continues to be the statistic that people fixate on.

Communications about severe disease and hospitalization face an uphill battle. Efficacy is much easier to explain — do you get sick or not? For severe disease, on the other hand, many studies have slightly different benchmarks for severity. And while right now there have been zero hospitalizations and zero deaths by anyone vaccinated in the clinical trials for any of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, it doesn’t mean those outcomes are guaranteed. (Again, in Israel, 0.002 percent have been hospitalized so far — that’s very, very low, but it’s not zero.)

Furthermore, as the pandemic stretches into its second year, we’re all desperate for certainty. “This study simply didn’t collect enough data to tell us what we hoped to learn” is not the answer any of us are looking for. The efficacy of the vaccines is known; their effectiveness against hospitalization and death is known to be very high but not pinned down for certain, especially not against the South African variant. All of those pose extraordinary challenges for public health officials and the media to communicate.

But a shift from a focus on efficacy to a focus on improved outcomes is essential for good vaccine decision-making. Moderna and Pfizer can’t produce enough mRNA vaccines alone to end the pandemic, so the public embrace of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — and potentially the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which we’re waiting to learn more on — might make a huge difference for whether things start to get back to normal in the US in April or in August. That’s a difference of potentially hundreds of thousands of lives lost.",voxdotcom,"['important', 'looking', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'clinical', 'johnson', 'disease', 'study', 'statistic', 'hospitalization', 'death', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 00:35:04+00:00,18,"In the fall, Devika Chopra, a gynecologist in Mumbai, got a notice from municipal authorities asking to fill out a form with personal information and the number of people who worked at her clinic.

As a health care worker, she and millions of her colleagues in India would be first in line for a Covid-19 vaccine. In January, she got an SMS message saying she had an appointment for her shot. She received her first dose of Covishield, the local name for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, at the end of last month. This weekend, she received an SMS and a call, and, on Monday, got her second dose.

“It was very systematic, and it was really well organized,” Chopra told me a few weeks after her first shot.

“In fact,” she added, “I think it’s the best vaccination drive that I have seen in the country.”

India still has a long way to go before it can fully appraise its Covid-19 vaccination campaign, a staggering effort that began last month. The nation of more than 1.3 billion is undertaking what may be the world’s largest vaccination push.

India has given out more than 12 million doses of two approved Covid-19 vaccinations since the rollout began January 16. At its start, India had one of the fastest rollouts in the world by sheer number of people who got injections, vaccinating 1 million people in six days. But in a country of its size, it is like the tip of the tip of the pin.

The pace has slowed since, driven by a combination of factors, from glitches with the country’s vaccination app to vaccine hesitancy, fueled by what some critics have said was a hasty vaccine approval process that lacked transparency and a dramatic decline in Covid-19 cases in India, after some of the highest infection rates in the world.

The immunization drive has also not yet entered its next phase, in which people over 50 and those with underlying conditions — some 270 million people — will be eligible.

Still, the country has set an ambitious goal of vaccinating about 300 million people by this summer, nearly one United States-worth of inoculations.

“But it’s only one-fourth” of India’s entire population, K. Viswanath, a professor of health communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told me. “Just the sheer scale is very daunting.”

If any country could pull it off, though, it might be India. It has undertaken mass vaccination campaigns before, as with polio, though experts say inoculating adults presents different challenges than that effort, which focused on children. India also regularly conducts the world’s biggest elections, and is drawing on that experience and infrastructure to help its Covid-19 immunization push. And India, sometimes known as the world’s medicine cabinet, has the production and manufacturing capabilities to make vaccines — and export them to the rest of the world.

So far, though, the vaccination campaign has been underwhelming. Right now, less than 1 percent of India’s population is vaccinated, an untenable pace if India wants to give two Covid-19 doses to hundreds of millions of people by summer.

Many people I spoke to believe the capacity is there, and that any of India’s early stumbles are just “teething issues,” as a few experts put it. But whatever challenges it might face, India’s campaign is unlike any other, both for its size and the diversity of areas it’s trying to reach.

“The Covid-19 vaccine program in India is one of the most ambitious vaccine campaigns in the world,” Brian Wahl, an India-based epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me.

India’s experience with mass inoculations and elections is key

Before India launched its vaccination campaign on January 16, it did some dry runs, holding mock vaccination drives across the country to test the logistics of delivering doses and the technology used to track and monitor vaccine appointments. The run-through even included dummy vaccines, to fully train health care workers.

When it comes to mass vaccination programs, these are muscles India has used before, if not at this incredible scale. The country has undertaken large-scale immunization campaigns before, most notably against polio. It also has a strong universal immunization program to deliver vaccines to children and pregnant women across its vast population.

Those undertakings meant that India already had in place a lot of the infrastructure required to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to different states and populations, including rural areas.

The country has established “cold chain” points to safely transport, store, and deliver vaccines that require low temperatures. Indian officials say they have approximately 29,000 cold chain points and 41,000 deep freezers for vaccines (though the country isn’t using the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which require extreme cold storage).

“We have an advantage of having a structure in place, with cold chains and deliveries and vaccination centers and trained staff — so that’s the big, big plus point,” said Naveen Thacker, executive director of the International Pediatric Association and former representative to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance’s board.

This already-in-place health infrastructure meant that unlike some countries — the United States, for instance — India isn’t really setting up massive vaccination centers in places like sports stadiums. It’s largely relying on a built-in network of hospitals and clinics as the hubs. “It is not an ‘If you build it, they will come’ approach — what they’re doing is actively going to where people are,” Viswanath told me.

India is also drawing from its experience holding elections, the world’s biggest. The democratic process spans weeks, and polling places and election officials go where the people are, no matter how remote — even if it requires airlifting officials up a mountain or into a forested valley to record someone’s vote.

India last voted in 2019, and the country is using its voter rolls to identify people eligible to receive the vaccine. It is also deploying some of the same infrastructure, techniques, and even personnel in the inoculation drive: A security guard who normally stands watch at a voting booth may now instead guard vaccines.

Narendra Kumar Arora, executive director of INCLEN Trust International, an international clinical epidemiology network, and chair of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines under India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, said India is relying on this critical combination of health and election infrastructure to deliver vaccines to its population.

When it comes to mass vaccination campaigns, these are muscles India has used before

“The location of the immunization center is driven by the map used for election booths, and the other requirement is driven by health systems’ previous experience,” Arora told me.

Right now, India is targeting front-line workers for vaccination: about 10 million or so doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals, and about 20 million others like police officers and sanitation workers.

India hasn’t fully deployed its vaccination infrastructure, though it is picking up the pace, or “getting warmed up,” as Arora put it. India launched its drive with about 3,000 immunization centers. As of last week, it was up to about 10,000. Over the coming weeks it will scale up to between 50,000 and 100,000 immunization centers.

But the warming-up period does look disappointing on paper — especially when taking into account India’s vaccination know-how. To reach its goal of vaccinating 300 million people by summer, India will have to succeed at inoculating around 1.5 million people daily. In a little more than a month since the campaign started, the country had just cracked 12 million doses total.

And a question right now is whether India really is just warming up for this undertaking, or if the sluggish start is a warning of bigger problems ahead.

Want a vaccine? India has an app for that. But does it work?

As much as India is relying on its long-built expertise on immunizations, the government is also launching a new system: its Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network, or CoWIN, app.

CoWIN is a digital platform for the vaccination campaign. People will register with the app, and through that they’ll receive communication when they’re eligible to get their first, and second, shot. CoWIN will also help India track the vaccinations, keep track of vials in cold storage, and figure out how many doses to allocate to different places. It’s meant to provide real-time monitoring of the immunization campaign.

But the system has had its fair share of glitches, some of which may be stalling the vaccination drive.

Technical problems meant people weren’t getting messages about their appointments to get vaccinated. The MIT Technology Review spoke to one physician who got a message intended for someone else. The system itself was slow in loading information required to verify who was getting a vaccine.

It also wasn’t particularly nimble: If someone didn’t show up for their appointment, it was difficult to fill those slots, or have people sign up for cancellations. Hospitals had to adjust and allow for walk-ins to overcome some of the issues. The app has been crashing, too.

Health officials in several Indian states faced problems when trying to schedule second-dose appointments using the app, as the software didn’t recognize that people had already gotten their first shots. According to the Times of India, because of issues with the app last week, only 25 percent of those eligible for a second dose were able to get a shot in Maharashtra; in Mumbai, only 4 percent of a little more than 1,900 people got their second shot.

And this is all before CoWIN has been made available to the general public. Right now, the app is relying on ready-made lists of health care and front-line workers, who are the only ones getting a shot. This is a manageable number of people whose credentials are pretty easy to verify and who probably know better than most how and where to get a vaccine.

The goal of the CoWIN app is to get the general public to register for vaccinations, and “that facility will be opened up once the program is more confident about the performance,” Arora said, about resolving some of those “last-mile glitches.”

But even then, there are concerns about how well the app will work for a mass vaccination campaign. In the United States, seniors in particular have struggled with using some of the digital vaccine appointment platforms, and some experts fear that could be replicated in India. People may not be able to navigate the app, or become frustrated with it if it is glitchy, and those people may give up altogether.

Health officials will still use other sources to identify those eligible including voter rolls, medical records, and other documentation. Door-knocking — a tried-and-true method for vaccination campaigns, especially in India — will also supplement CoWIN’s self-registration. Such a massive campaign requires a wide range of strategies, but a lot does seem to hinge on this technology.

Beyond that, there are privacy concerns, since the CoWIN app will include identifying documents, including India’s equivalent of a Social Security number. Fake CoWIN apps have also cropped up in various app stores, raising fears of scams and misinformation.

And all of this may contribute to India’s other major problem with its vaccine rollout so far: vaccine hesitancy.

The biggest hurdle may be vaccine hesitancy, and India may take some of the blame

Ritika Aggarwal, a psychologist in Mumbai, got her first dose of the Covishield vaccine in February, a little less than a month after India began its vaccination campaign.

She didn’t want to get the shot immediately, and said she was a little nervous. Some of her worry was over having tuned out the news a little bit, and her desire to get more information.

“I waited for a lot of the doctors to take it and give me their feedback,” Aggarwal told me. “Then a lot of discussion with family in terms of whether should I go, or should I not?”

Aggarwal did go. She was anxious up until she received the injection at the local hospital. After her dose, she saw the informational posters and the reading material that explained the process and the potential side effects. Once she left the hospital, she said, “I was perfectly fine. I think once it was just in motion, the anxiety completely settled.”

Aggarwal is relieved to have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine — even if, as she points out, she’ll still have to be vigilant. But her anxiety isn’t unusual for India’s front-line workers, many of whom, like her, want the vaccine but have concerns about which ones are available.

India has approved two vaccines for emergency use. One, Covishield, is the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine being produced by the Serum Institute of India (which is also producing that vaccine for much of the rest of the world).

The other is Covaxin, developed by the Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. But Covaxin was approved before it completed its phase 3 clinical trials, so it lacks full efficacy and safety data — a dearth of transparency criticized by many prominent Indian experts and physicians.

“This vaccine, when it received the regulatory emergency approval, was still and continues to be in the phase 3 stage. So there were no data for efficacy. So that was the primary concern,” Malini Aisola, co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), an organization that promotes equitable access to medicines, told me. Aisola said experts and scientists have also questioned the basis on which the vaccine was given the emergency approval.

As Aggarwal told me, she wasn’t sure she wanted to get a vaccine that was still in the study phase, though she ended up being able to get Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine. Indian media have reported similar phenomena, with health care workers more reluctant to get Covaxin and overall turnout for the vaccine much lower than anticipated.

According to the Guardian, a few days after the vaccination drive began, overall turnout was about 64 percent of what was initially expected, with attendance much lower in certain states, like Punjab, which only had 22 percent of expected turnout. All of that has dragged down India’s vaccination numbers.

“One of the factors in the early vaccine hesitancy or resistance that some health care workers had could have been that some felt they could hold out for a few months more, by which time perhaps efficacy data would become available,” Aisola said.

As Aisola explained, Indian regulators have imposed certain safeguards around the use of Covaxin, and there is close monitoring of anyone who receives the dose. Recipients also get follow-up phone calls and have to keep a diary for several days — all of which makes sense, but may be, as she pointed out, “another source of anxiety.”

More transparency would help build public confidence in the vaccines, whether it is Covaxin or Covishield. “It would also really help the government in its own objective of trying to have a successful vaccination drive, because people will be able to see that the government is really in their corner in terms of protecting their safety by sharing the information transparently,” Aisola said.

And she and other experts pointed out it will help squash the inevitable rumors and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Otherwise, the worst-case scenario might occur, where legitimate concerns about transparency around vaccines merge with outright misinformation, confusing people and deterring them from taking any vaccine.

Uptake among front-line workers has increased, with about two-thirds of all health care workers now vaccinated, according to Arora. He credits additional outreach around safety and efficacy.

But the struggles for turnout also could be a warning sign, if the very people who’ll be delivering the vaccines to everyone else are themselves hesitant to get the injection. After all, the health care workers are the advocates, the examples for everyone in the vaccination drive. They’re also very likely to be the ones vaccinating others.

India is also struggling with the same viral misinformation around Covid-19 and the vaccines that other countries are dealing with. India, in particular, has seen disinformation spread across social media channels, particularly through WhatsApp.

“You can prepare everything, but you can never judge people’s minds,” the International Pediatric Association’s Thacker said. “And we live in a very small world, so whatever happens in South Africa, US, UK, Spain, Italy, immediately reaches to India.”

Another element possibly contributing to vaccine hesitancy: India’s relative good fortune of having a more manageable pandemic right now. India has recorded the most Covid-19 cases of any country behind the United States, with more than 150,000 deaths. But cases began falling since a peak in September, swiftly and somewhat perplexingly, and have remained comparatively low since.

That’s a great thing overall, of course. But experts worry that low case counts, combined with vaccine questions, might make it much harder to convince Indians that it’s urgent they get a shot.

“When you don’t see cases on a daily basis, it makes demand-generation that much more difficult,” said Wahl, the India-based epidemiologist. And vaccination is “still critical — no country is out of the weeds yet — and having the greatest proportion of your population protected is super important.”

All of this is going to make it harder for India to achieve the goals of its vaccination drive — though Thacker told me the country still has the capacity to hit that goal of vaccinating 300 million by summer. “If we are able to tackle this infodemic and communication challenge,” he said, “India can deliver.”

Health workers I spoke to in India said they’ve heard from patients that they have concerns — they want to get the vaccine, but they are concerned about side effects. Chopra, the doctor who now is fully vaccinated, said that when talking to patients, she acknowledges that there are uncertainties, but she encourages people to trust the process. She is direct about the possibility of side effects. She posted a detailed account of her own vaccination experience, documenting the exact symptoms she felt in the hours after each dose. A sore arm, she posted, was the worst of her second shot.

And, of course, not everyone needs convincing to get the Covid-19 vaccine. They are eager for the next phase of India’s campaign to begin.

“Most of my in-laws, and my parents, friends — everyone’s only question is, when are they going to roll it out for us?” Aggarwal said. “They’re all just waiting for the vaccine.”",voxdotcom,"['indias', 'country', 'india', 'app', 'health', 'covid19', 'campaign', 'vaccine', 'vaccination', 'million', 'unlike', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-25 00:30:16+00:00,23,"When Melissa Creary talks about racism in health care, she has first-hand experience: As a public health expert at the University of Michigan with decades of research experience, she’s an expert on sickle cell disease, the disparities in its effects, and how discrimination and stigma feed into those outcomes. But she also lives with the disease, and, she told me, has learned to navigate racism in the health care system herself.

Sickle cell disease causes some red blood cells to transform into crescent shapes, increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems and organ failure, and often producing agonizing pain. The disease afflicts 100,000 Americans, most of them Black. Because it doesn’t affect the white majority the health care system was by and large built for, it’s long been under-researched and undertreated — in fact, life expectancy for sickle cell patients fell in recent decades, according to Kaiser Health News, even as life expectancy increased overall.

“The lifelong consequences of living in a society that protects and values unequally, matched with the lifelong physiologic burdens of disease, propel me to work toward ways to combat structural racism and increase the quality of life for this population,” Creary said.

These unbalanced outcomes are just one example of the racial disparities in health care that have fueled the Black-white life expectancy gap.

Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 70,000 Black people died prematurely in 2019 compared to their white peers — on average, 190 people dying prematurely every day for a year.

Covid-19 has likely made that worse. Due to a range of structural factors, Black people are disproportionately likely to get seriously ill and die from the disease. A recent study in PNAS found that the Black-white life expectancy gap grew by nearly a year and a half in 2020 due to the coronavirus, from 3.6 to 5 years.

That’s equal to undoing more than a decade of progress in closing the gap. The Black-white gap had been narrowing, partly due to improvements in access to health care (good) and drops in life expectancy among some white groups (bad). Covid-19 reversed part, though not all, of the improvements.

So I asked experts and researchers in this area: How does the US get back on track — and how does it finally erase this gap for good?

The overall goal, in short, is to make Black life a bit more like the better parts of white life. Today, it’s often challenging for Black people and their communities to make the healthy decision: Between lack of access to health insurance, food deserts with no healthy eating options, and inflexible family and work schedules that make time to exercise difficult to find, Black people have fewer opportunities than their white counterparts to do what’s best for their health.

“Race is not the risk factor,” Creary said. “Racism is.”

Policy could play a role in fixing this. Different levels of government could increase access to health care through an expansion of Medicaid (which serves populations with low incomes or disabilities) or other existing government health care benefits, and make the delivery of that health care more equitable and better suited to a diverse population. Lawmakers could try to address underlying socioeconomic gaps, which in turn can drive disparities in life expectancy by fueling poor social determinants of health. These policies can be targeted toward Black communities or be universal — even those that in theory benefit all Americans, like a child allowance that would send cash to parents every month, can in effect help lift Black people since they’re more likely to face impoverished conditions.

But there’s also an underlying cultural element to this. To the extent that much of what holds Black people back is simply discrimination by individuals, that will have to be alleviated in some way or another by a broader cultural and social shift. That’s not to say that policy can’t help — it can — but that there’s work to be done in less tangible realms of hearts and minds to help make American society less racist.

Ultimately, addressing the gap will require a truly systemic shift at both the policy and cultural levels. But America has made progress in this area, before Covid-19, and it can continue doing so in the aftermath.

Why there’s a big Black-white life expectancy gap

The Black-white life expectancy gap can be distilled to one fact: US society has, in many ways, made it easier for a white person to live a fully healthy life than a Black person.

This is personal for Jamila Taylor, the health care director at the progressive Century Foundation. Her father died of prostate cancer at just 44, and she has seen other Black people in her life — aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends — die prematurely as well.

“There are still these structural barriers — not only through the health care system but through broader society — that impact the ability of the African American community to lead healthy and productive lives,” Taylor told me. “We see structural racism interwoven through institutions throughout this country.”

The average white person is more likely than the average Black person to have health insurance and access to care. The average white person is more likely to live near a grocery store with healthy options. She’s more likely to live in a good school district. She’s more likely to live in a neighborhood with better air quality. She’s more likely to live in a community that isn’t plagued by gun violence. She’s more likely to have flexible work conditions. And on and on.

That’s not to say every single white American has it great — that’s obviously not true. But, on average, Black people tend to face much bigger challenges for living the healthiest life possible. That shows up in the life expectancy gap: White people were expected to live nearly 79 years on average before Covid-19 and almost 78 years after, while Black people were expected to live nearly 75 years before Covid-19 and almost 73 after, according to the PNAS study. The Black life expectancy even before Covid-19 was equivalent to what the white life expectancy was in the 1970s — as though decades of progress in well-being and health care were suddenly erased.

There are many, many reasons for this. Throughout US history, outright discrimination has driven Black people into poorer communities with more pollution and less access to healthy food, while keeping access to good jobs, homes, and health care out of reach. The aftermath of Jim Crow and slavery, and insufficient action to repair the harms such policies afflicted on Black communities, left big socioeconomic disparities in place, including a very large racial wealth gap. Whether it’s explicit or implicit, there’s no part of Black life that systemic racism, past or present, hasn’t touched.

Meanwhile, America’s health care system in particular has an awful record on race. As one example, researchers in the Tuskegee study used Black people as unwilling test subjects — allowing them to languish with syphilis and even die. Black patients have also dealt with a health care system that has long dismissed their legitimate concerns, whether it’s regarding pain or maternal health. Surveys show that, as a result, Black people are less likely to trust the health care system, and perhaps less likely to use it even when it could help them.

“It’s a very intimate thing — your medical history — and there’s a lot of potential judgment involved and vulnerability involved,” Marcella Alsan, an economist and public health expert at Harvard Kennedy School, told me. “You have to have a belief in the person giving you the advice.”

All of that has, in some way or another, bled over to Black people’s health. Black people are more likely to suffer from health conditions that lead to a shorter life, like obesity, and report poorer health overall relative to their white peers. As a result, Black people also suffer from higher age-adjusted mortality rates in general but also are more likely to die due to almost every major killer of Americans, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Covid-19 has exposed these harsh realities. The virus isn’t racist, but the society and the systems it has spread in are, at the very least, racially biased. It’s that society and systems that have enabled a country in which Black people are more likely to suffer from conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. And it’s in that environment that Black people have disproportionately died of the coronavirus, undoing more than a decade’s worth of work in reducing the life expectancy gap.

Health care policies can help fix the life expectancy gap

The good news is this is an area where good policy changes can make a real impact — literally life or death for Black communities.

Part of this could be focused on the health care system, particularly through helping poor populations that are disproportionately likely to be Black. There are lots of specific options here:

Bigger federal subsidies for health care plans. The federal government could boost subsidies for health insurance plans on Obamacare marketplaces, making them more affordable. About 11.4 percent of non-elderly Black Americans were uninsured in 2019, compared to 7.8 percent of non-elderly white Americans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Based on surveys, the biggest reason for being uninsured is inability to afford it. Under Obamacare, the federal government already subsidizes health plans in the individual marketplace for lower-income families — but it could, as President Joe Biden has proposed doing, pay for an even bigger chunk of those families’ health care costs. Congress is currently pursuing this as part of the Covid-19 relief bill.

Congress is currently pursuing this as part of the Covid-19 relief bill. More states could expand Medicaid through Obamacare. Under the Affordable Care Act, states were encouraged to expand their Medicaid programs to include everyone up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, with the promise that the federal government would pick up at least 90 percent of the cost. But 12 states, including populous Texas, Florida, and Georgia, haven’t expanded Medicaid. That’s disproportionately hurt Black people, based on a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis: “Uninsured Blacks are more likely than Whites to fall in the coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid.” Congress is also considering boosting federal payments for Medicaid to encourage states to expand the program.

That’s disproportionately hurt Black people, based on a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis: “Uninsured Blacks are more likely than Whites to fall in the coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid.” Congress is also considering boosting federal payments for Medicaid to encourage states to expand the program. More generous Medicaid payments. Black people are more likely, due to worse economic conditions, to be on Medicaid than their white peers: About 15 percent of non-elderly white people are on Medicaid, compared to 33 percent of non-elderly Black people. But Medicaid plans generally don’t pay as much as private health insurance plans, leading some doctors to refuse Medicaid patients altogether. By making Medicaid rates and payments to doctors and hospitals more competitive with private plans, more doctors might be willing to accept Medicaid patients, and as a result serve this disproportionately Black population. These kinds of decisions are typically left to the states — meaning state lawmakers have most of the power here — but Congress could offer financial incentives to, say, boost primary care reimbursements.

All of these steps address an issue that comes up again and again in this space — what Taylor described as an unmistakable “divide” between Black and white Americans’ access to health care and ability to afford it.

There are also more targeted, innovative approaches. One study in the American Economic Review, from Alsan, found Black patients tend to do better with Black doctors — leading to the patients selecting more preventive services, including a flu shot. The researchers found Black doctors alone could cut the Black-white gap among men in cardiovascular mortality by 19 percent.

Alsan cautioned that we’re still figuring out why that is. One aspect is trust: If you don’t trust the health care system because you believe it’s racist, a Black doctor might be able to dispel some of those notions. It’s also possible that Black doctors, who are more likely to be part of the same communities as their Black patients, may already have earned trust and know how to communicate with their patients more effectively. Or Black doctors might be able to, in some cases, better address Black patients’ specific needs — particularly if the issue is a condition, like sickle cell disease, that disproportionately afflicts Black people and that a Black doctor may be personally more aware of.

All of that and more could create the circumstances where diversifying the medical workforce could boost outcomes for Black patients. But as it stands, Black people are underrepresented in health care professions: Black people make up roughly 13 percent of the US population but about 4 percent of doctors. Policymakers could move to address this gap by, for example, improving financial supports for Black people going to medical school.

“It’s about the opportunity,” Alsan said. “If I want to see a female gynecologist, I can do it. If you want to see a male urologist, you can do it.” The same, she explained, should be true for Black patients and doctors.

Policies outside health care could help, too

Beyond health care, lawmakers could tackle the life expectancy gap through some of its underlying causes, particularly socioeconomic forces that limit Black people’s ability to live as healthy as they’d like. A stronger social safety net in general, whether it comes through universal basic income or a child allowance — which has already been introduced by federal lawmakers, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), and could get a boost in the coming Covid-19 relief package — could provide the financial support necessary to actually afford better food, preventive health care, a gym pass, and all the other keys to a healthier life.

All levels of government could address food deserts where there aren’t fully stocked grocery stores — by providing subsidies to encourage more companies to open shops or tapping into growing delivery services to ship healthier foods to underserved areas. Baltimore, for example, previously set up a system to let residents in food deserts order food online.

They could also take steps to clean up the environment. Some of these efforts have been going on for decades, from asbestos and lead abatement programs to clean energy initiatives that all levels of government have launched. But because they are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods with outdated housing, Black people haven’t benefited from these efforts as much. Finishing the job here, through federal incentives or state and local measures, could address vast and remaining concerns about environmental inequity.

The idea is to make it so Black people have the resources and living conditions that enable a healthier lifestyle, aligning them a bit closer to the resources and living conditions that their white peers are currently more likely to have.

Policy approaches also don’t have to be explicitly targeted by race because policies that are in theory universal can have disproportionately beneficial effects for Black people since they’re likelier to fall toward the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, for example, wasn’t framed as a racial policy. But it shrank disparities in both health care coverage and access to care.

It’s also easier to sell to a wider audience and get support in Congress. The Medicaid expansion, although it’s essentially socialist medicine, has won in Republican-dominated states.

That suggests a universal approach may be a more politically favorable path to shrinking the Black-white life expectancy gap. “Hopefully, that will make people more comfortable,” Taylor said.

Policy can’t fix everything

As much as policy can help, it probably can’t close the entire Black-white life expectancy gap on its own.

That’s because, to some extent, the gap is driven by outright discrimination in health care, jobs, housing, education, and more. Lawmakers have acted against such discrimination — that’s what laws like the Civil Rights Act tried to address — but it clearly persists.

What policy can’t achieve will need to be addressed by both individuals and society at large with social and cultural changes. Some of that is already taking place, as surveys find racial resentment has decreased over the past few decades. But a lot of work could still be done, whether it’s continuing to change media depictions of Black people, addressing racism in workplaces, or facilitating compassionate conversations in private spaces.

As that cultural work goes on in parallel, though, better policy could help. The US is poised to act on some of these issues, too: President Biden and Democrats in Congress, which swept into power over the past few months while voicing support for racial justice and Black Lives Matter, are currently working on an economic relief package that includes more generous subsidies for Obamacare marketplace health plans, more incentives for states to expand Medicaid, and other policies, like child tax credits, that could reduce some of the broader socioeconomic disparities between Black and white Americans.

But even that would only be the start. To really finish the job and close the full Black-white life expectancy gap, America will need to adopt more aggressive policies — like incentivizing primary care reimbursements — and address the racial injustices seeded in American life. After Covid-19, it’s all the clearer such systemic changes are truly needed.

2021-02-24 19:01:39+00:00,22,"A panel of expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously on Friday afternoon to recommend the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson for an emergency use authorization. The next step is for the FDA to accept the recommendation, which could happen as soon as this weekend, clearing the way for distribution.

Earlier this week, the FDA posted a briefing going over the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which included 40,000 participants in several countries divided randomly into placebo and treatment groups.

The most important finding: The vaccine was 100 percent effective after 28 days at preventing deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 among the clinical trial participants who received the treatment. (Two vaccine recipients were hospitalized with Covid-19 two weeks after receiving the injection.)

The vaccine was also 66.1 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness after four weeks, with consistent results across all age groups. When looking at blocking severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.4 percent effective.

Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, said during a press conference last month that the vaccine also had “plain vanilla safety results,” with the vast majority of recipients experiencing no problems. Most of the reported symptoms were mild, including fatigue, arm pain, and fever.

The efficacy levels against severe to critical Covid-19 changed depending on where the vaccine was tested. It was 85.9 percent in the United States after four weeks, while in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, efficacy against severe disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.

Health officials say that while the Johnson & Johnson efficacy results are not as high as those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, the two vaccines that have already received emergency use authorizations from the FDA, the new vaccine’s performance is still superb.

“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the press conference last month. The vaccine was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson based in Belgium, together with Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson’s doesn’t require a booster shot, circumventing the two-dose problems posed by its competitors. There’s no need to track people down for their second dose, which means more people could be vaccinated faster. The shots also don’t require deep-cold storage, which means they’re less costly and somewhat easier to distribute.

“It’s a complete game changer,” said Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin. “It completely changes the equation.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also different in another way. It uses an adenovirus vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also less expensive to manufacture than the mRNA platform used for the other vaccines. (It’s estimated to cost around $10 per vaccine dose — roughly half the cost of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.)

Johnson & Johnson has promised enough vaccines for 20 million Americans by the end of March and 100 million Americans by the end of June despite production challenges. It would be a huge boost to the 65 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in the US so far.

So even with an overall efficacy level that’s lower than the two other vaccines on the US market, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could become a major player. It’s the vaccine that “can increase equity,” said Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, particularly “if it’s deployed strategically in nations that are hard to reach and where that would be a particular challenge under a two-dose schedule.” Johnson & Johnson expects to distribute a billion doses of its vaccine worldwide this year.

But as amazing as it is to see several effective Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time, it’s now clear that the technology alone won’t save the day. An orchestra of supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, staff, and public trust needs to harmonize in order to actually get billions of shots into arms around the world and finally draw the pandemic to a close. And we also have other hurdles to overcome: controlling the spread of variants that seem to be threatening the effectiveness of all the vaccines we have.

What we learned about the safety and efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine

Johnson & Johnson launched separate clinical trials testing both a one-dose and a two-dose regimen to see how well these strategies provided long-term protection against Covid-19. The one-dose phase 3 trial arm yielded efficacy results first.

But hints that this vaccine could be safe and effective have been trickling out for months. The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

“You know, we’ve got millions of people who’ve received these vaccines already, which is exciting,” he added. “We’re on our way.”",voxdotcom,"['advisers', 'vector', 'phase', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'world', 'johnson', 'recommend', 'johnsons', 'fda', 'adenovirus', 'unanimously', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-24 16:26:52+00:00,30,"When Melissa Creary talks about racism in health care, she has first-hand experience: As a public health expert at the University of Michigan with decades of research experience, she’s an expert on sickle cell disease, the disparities in its effects, and how discrimination and stigma feed into those outcomes. But she also lives with the disease, and, she told me, has learned to navigate racism in the health care system herself.

Sickle cell disease causes some red blood cells to transform into crescent shapes, increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems and organ failure, and often producing agonizing pain. The disease afflicts 100,000 Americans, most of them Black. Because it doesn’t affect the white majority the health care system was by and large built for, it’s long been under-researched and undertreated — in fact, life expectancy for sickle cell patients fell in recent decades, according to Kaiser Health News, even as life expectancy increased overall.

“The lifelong consequences of living in a society that protects and values unequally, matched with the lifelong physiologic burdens of disease, propel me to work toward ways to combat structural racism and increase the quality of life for this population,” Creary said.

These unbalanced outcomes are just one example of the racial disparities in health care that have fueled the Black-white life expectancy gap.

Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 70,000 Black people died prematurely in 2019 compared to their white peers — on average, 190 people dying prematurely every day for a year.

Covid-19 has likely made that worse. Due to a range of structural factors, Black people are disproportionately likely to get seriously ill and die from the disease. A recent study in PNAS found that the Black-white life expectancy gap grew by nearly a year and a half in 2020 due to the coronavirus, from 3.6 to 5 years.

That’s equal to undoing more than a decade of progress in closing the gap. The Black-white gap had been narrowing, partly due to improvements in access to health care (good) and drops in life expectancy among some white groups (bad). Covid-19 reversed part, though not all, of the improvements.

So I asked experts and researchers in this area: How does the US get back on track — and how does it finally erase this gap for good?

The overall goal, in short, is to make Black life a bit more like the better parts of white life. Today, it’s often challenging for Black people and their communities to make the healthy decision: Between lack of access to health insurance, food deserts with no healthy eating options, and inflexible family and work schedules that make time to exercise difficult to find, Black people have fewer opportunities than their white counterparts to do what’s best for their health.

“Race is not the risk factor,” Creary said. “Racism is.”

Policy could play a role in fixing this. Different levels of government could increase access to health care through an expansion of Medicaid (which serves populations with low incomes or disabilities) or other existing government health care benefits, and make the delivery of that health care more equitable and better suited to a diverse population. Lawmakers could try to address underlying socioeconomic gaps, which in turn can drive disparities in life expectancy by fueling poor social determinants of health. These policies can be targeted toward Black communities or be universal — even those that in theory benefit all Americans, like a child allowance that would send cash to parents every month, can in effect help lift Black people since they’re more likely to face impoverished conditions.

But there’s also an underlying cultural element to this. To the extent that much of what holds Black people back is simply discrimination by individuals, that will have to be alleviated in some way or another by a broader cultural and social shift. That’s not to say that policy can’t help — it can — but that there’s work to be done in less tangible realms of hearts and minds to help make American society less racist.

Ultimately, addressing the gap will require a truly systemic shift at both the policy and cultural levels. But America has made progress in this area, before Covid-19, and it can continue doing so in the aftermath.

Why there’s a big Black-white life expectancy gap

The Black-white life expectancy gap can be distilled to one fact: US society has, in many ways, made it easier for a white person to live a fully healthy life than a Black person.

This is personal for Jamila Taylor, the health care director at the progressive Century Foundation. Her father died of prostate cancer at just 44, and she has seen other Black people in her life — aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends — die prematurely as well.

“There are still these structural barriers — not only through the health care system but through broader society — that impact the ability of the African American community to lead healthy and productive lives,” Taylor told me. “We see structural racism interwoven through institutions throughout this country.”

The average white person is more likely than the average Black person to have health insurance and access to care. The average white person is more likely to live near a grocery store with healthy options. She’s more likely to live in a good school district. She’s more likely to live in a neighborhood with better air quality. She’s more likely to live in a community that isn’t plagued by gun violence. She’s more likely to have flexible work conditions. And on and on.

That’s not to say every single white American has it great — that’s obviously not true. But, on average, Black people tend to face much bigger challenges for living the healthiest life possible. That shows up in the life expectancy gap: White people were expected to live nearly 79 years on average before Covid-19 and almost 78 years after, while Black people were expected to live nearly 75 years before Covid-19 and almost 73 after, according to the PNAS study. The Black life expectancy even before Covid-19 was equivalent to what the white life expectancy was in the 1970s — as though decades of progress in well-being and health care were suddenly erased.

There are many, many reasons for this. Throughout US history, outright discrimination has driven Black people into poorer communities with more pollution and less access to healthy food, while keeping access to good jobs, homes, and health care out of reach. The aftermath of Jim Crow and slavery, and insufficient action to repair the harms such policies afflicted on Black communities, left big socioeconomic disparities in place, including a very large racial wealth gap. Whether it’s explicit or implicit, there’s no part of Black life that systemic racism, past or present, hasn’t touched.

Meanwhile, America’s health care system in particular has an awful record on race. As one example, researchers in the Tuskegee study used Black people as unwilling test subjects — allowing them to languish with syphilis and even die. Black patients have also dealt with a health care system that has long dismissed their legitimate concerns, whether it’s regarding pain or maternal health. Surveys show that, as a result, Black people are less likely to trust the health care system, and perhaps less likely to use it even when it could help them.

“It’s a very intimate thing — your medical history — and there’s a lot of potential judgment involved and vulnerability involved,” Marcella Alsan, an economist and public health expert at Harvard Kennedy School, told me. “You have to have a belief in the person giving you the advice.”

All of that has, in some way or another, bled over to Black people’s health. Black people are more likely to suffer from health conditions that lead to a shorter life, like obesity, and report poorer health overall relative to their white peers. As a result, Black people also suffer from higher age-adjusted mortality rates in general but also are more likely to die due to almost every major killer of Americans, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Covid-19 has exposed these harsh realities. The virus isn’t racist, but the society and the systems it has spread in are, at the very least, racially biased. It’s that society and systems that have enabled a country in which Black people are more likely to suffer from conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. And it’s in that environment that Black people have disproportionately died of the coronavirus, undoing more than a decade’s worth of work in reducing the life expectancy gap.

Health care policies can help fix the life expectancy gap

The good news is this is an area where good policy changes can make a real impact — literally life or death for Black communities.

Part of this could be focused on the health care system, particularly through helping poor populations that are disproportionately likely to be Black. There are lots of specific options here:

Bigger federal subsidies for health care plans. The federal government could boost subsidies for health insurance plans on Obamacare marketplaces, making them more affordable. About 11.4 percent of non-elderly Black Americans were uninsured in 2019, compared to 7.8 percent of non-elderly white Americans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Based on surveys, the biggest reason for being uninsured is inability to afford it. Under Obamacare, the federal government already subsidizes health plans in the individual marketplace for lower-income families — but it could, as President Joe Biden has proposed doing, pay for an even bigger chunk of those families’ health care costs. Congress is currently pursuing this as part of the Covid-19 relief bill.

Congress is currently pursuing this as part of the Covid-19 relief bill. More states could expand Medicaid through Obamacare. Under the Affordable Care Act, states were encouraged to expand their Medicaid programs to include everyone up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, with the promise that the federal government would pick up at least 90 percent of the cost. But 12 states, including populous Texas, Florida, and Georgia, haven’t expanded Medicaid. That’s disproportionately hurt Black people, based on a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis: “Uninsured Blacks are more likely than Whites to fall in the coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid.” Congress is also considering boosting federal payments for Medicaid to encourage states to expand the program.

More generous Medicaid payments. Black people are more likely, due to worse economic conditions, to be on Medicaid than their white peers: About 15 percent of non-elderly white people are on Medicaid, compared to 33 percent of non-elderly Black people. But Medicaid plans generally don’t pay as much as private health insurance plans, leading some doctors to refuse Medicaid patients altogether. By making Medicaid rates and payments to doctors and hospitals more competitive with private plans, more doctors might be willing to accept Medicaid patients, and as a result serve this disproportionately Black population. These kinds of decisions are typically left to the states — meaning state lawmakers have most of the power here — but Congress could offer financial incentives to, say, boost primary care reimbursements.

All of these steps address an issue that comes up again and again in this space — what Taylor described as an unmistakable “divide” between Black and white Americans’ access to health care and ability to afford it.

There are also more targeted, innovative approaches. One study in the American Economic Review, from Alsan, found Black patients tend to do better with Black doctors — leading to the patients selecting more preventive services, including a flu shot. The researchers found Black doctors alone could cut the Black-white gap among men in cardiovascular mortality by 19 percent.

Alsan cautioned that we’re still figuring out why that is. One aspect is trust: If you don’t trust the health care system because you believe it’s racist, a Black doctor might be able to dispel some of those notions. It’s also possible that Black doctors, who are more likely to be part of the same communities as their Black patients, may already have earned trust and know how to communicate with their patients more effectively. Or Black doctors might be able to, in some cases, better address Black patients’ specific needs — particularly if the issue is a condition, like sickle cell disease, that disproportionately afflicts Black people and that a Black doctor may be personally more aware of.

All of that and more could create the circumstances where diversifying the medical workforce could boost outcomes for Black patients. But as it stands, Black people are underrepresented in health care professions: Black people make up roughly 13 percent of the US population but about 4 percent of doctors. Policymakers could move to address this gap by, for example, improving financial supports for Black people going to medical school.

“It’s about the opportunity,” Alsan said. “If I want to see a female gynecologist, I can do it. If you want to see a male urologist, you can do it.” The same, she explained, should be true for Black patients and doctors.

Policies outside health care could help, too

Beyond health care, lawmakers could tackle the life expectancy gap through some of its underlying causes, particularly socioeconomic forces that limit Black people’s ability to live as healthy as they’d like. A stronger social safety net in general, whether it comes through universal basic income or a child allowance — which has already been introduced by federal lawmakers, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), and could get a boost in the coming Covid-19 relief package — could provide the financial support necessary to actually afford better food, preventive health care, a gym pass, and all the other keys to a healthier life.

All levels of government could address food deserts where there aren’t fully stocked grocery stores — by providing subsidies to encourage more companies to open shops or tapping into growing delivery services to ship healthier foods to underserved areas. Baltimore, for example, previously set up a system to let residents in food deserts order food online.

They could also take steps to clean up the environment. Some of these efforts have been going on for decades, from asbestos and lead abatement programs to clean energy initiatives that all levels of government have launched. But because they are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods with outdated housing, Black people haven’t benefited from these efforts as much. Finishing the job here, through federal incentives or state and local measures, could address vast and remaining concerns about environmental inequity.

The idea is to make it so Black people have the resources and living conditions that enable a healthier lifestyle, aligning them a bit closer to the resources and living conditions that their white peers are currently more likely to have.

Policy approaches also don’t have to be explicitly targeted by race because policies that are in theory universal can have disproportionately beneficial effects for Black people since they’re likelier to fall toward the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, for example, wasn’t framed as a racial policy. But it shrank disparities in both health care coverage and access to care.

It’s also easier to sell to a wider audience and get support in Congress. The Medicaid expansion, although it’s essentially socialist medicine, has won in Republican-dominated states.

That suggests a universal approach may be a more politically favorable path to shrinking the Black-white life expectancy gap. “Hopefully, that will make people more comfortable,” Taylor said.

Policy can’t fix everything

As much as policy can help, it probably can’t close the entire Black-white life expectancy gap on its own.

That’s because, to some extent, the gap is driven by outright discrimination in health care, jobs, housing, education, and more. Lawmakers have acted against such discrimination — that’s what laws like the Civil Rights Act tried to address — but it clearly persists.

What policy can’t achieve will need to be addressed by both individuals and society at large with social and cultural changes. Some of that is already taking place, as surveys find racial resentment has decreased over the past few decades. But a lot of work could still be done, whether it’s continuing to change media depictions of Black people, addressing racism in workplaces, or facilitating compassionate conversations in private spaces.

As that cultural work goes on in parallel, though, better policy could help. The US is poised to act on some of these issues, too: President Biden and Democrats in Congress, which swept into power over the past few months while voicing support for racial justice and Black Lives Matter, are currently working on an economic relief package that includes more generous subsidies for Obamacare marketplace health plans, more incentives for states to expand Medicaid, and other policies, like child tax credits, that could reduce some of the broader socioeconomic disparities between Black and white Americans.

But even that would only be the start. To really finish the job and close the full Black-white life expectancy gap, America will need to adopt more aggressive policies — like incentivizing primary care reimbursements — and address the racial injustices seeded in American life. After Covid-19, it’s all the clearer such systemic changes are truly needed.

2021-02-24 16:19:35+00:00,52,"A panel of expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously on Friday afternoon to recommend the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson for an emergency use authorization. The next step is for the FDA to accept the recommendation, which could happen as soon as this weekend, clearing the way for distribution.

Earlier this week, the FDA posted a briefing going over the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which included 40,000 participants in several countries divided randomly into placebo and treatment groups.

The most important finding: The vaccine was 100 percent effective after 28 days at preventing deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 among the clinical trial participants who received the treatment. (Two vaccine recipients were hospitalized with Covid-19 two weeks after receiving the injection.)

The vaccine was also 66.1 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness after four weeks, with consistent results across all age groups. When looking at blocking severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.4 percent effective.

Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, said during a press conference last month that the vaccine also had “plain vanilla safety results,” with the vast majority of recipients experiencing no problems. Most of the reported symptoms were mild, including fatigue, arm pain, and fever.

The efficacy levels against severe to critical Covid-19 changed depending on where the vaccine was tested. It was 85.9 percent in the United States after four weeks, while in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, efficacy against severe disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.

Health officials say that while the Johnson & Johnson efficacy results are not as high as those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, the two vaccines that have already received emergency use authorizations from the FDA, the new vaccine’s performance is still superb.

“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the press conference last month. The vaccine was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson based in Belgium, together with Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson’s doesn’t require a booster shot, circumventing the two-dose problems posed by its competitors. There’s no need to track people down for their second dose, which means more people could be vaccinated faster. The shots also don’t require deep-cold storage, which means they’re less costly and somewhat easier to distribute.

“It’s a complete game changer,” said Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin. “It completely changes the equation.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also different in another way. It uses an adenovirus vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also less expensive to manufacture than the mRNA platform used for the other vaccines. (It’s estimated to cost around $10 per vaccine dose — roughly half the cost of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.)

Johnson & Johnson has promised enough vaccines for 20 million Americans by the end of March and 100 million Americans by the end of June despite production challenges. It would be a huge boost to the 65 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in the US so far.

So even with an overall efficacy level that’s lower than the two other vaccines on the US market, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could become a major player. It’s the vaccine that “can increase equity,” said Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, particularly “if it’s deployed strategically in nations that are hard to reach and where that would be a particular challenge under a two-dose schedule.” Johnson & Johnson expects to distribute a billion doses of its vaccine worldwide this year.

But as amazing as it is to see several effective Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time, it’s now clear that the technology alone won’t save the day. An orchestra of supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, staff, and public trust needs to harmonize in order to actually get billions of shots into arms around the world and finally draw the pandemic to a close. And we also have other hurdles to overcome: controlling the spread of variants that seem to be threatening the effectiveness of all the vaccines we have.

What we learned about the safety and efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine

Johnson & Johnson launched separate clinical trials testing both a one-dose and a two-dose regimen to see how well these strategies provided long-term protection against Covid-19. The one-dose phase 3 trial arm yielded efficacy results first.

But hints that this vaccine could be safe and effective have been trickling out for months. The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

“You know, we’ve got millions of people who’ve received these vaccines already, which is exciting,” he added. “We’re on our way.”",voxdotcom,"['advisers', 'vector', 'phase', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'world', 'johnson', 'recommend', 'johnsons', 'fda', 'adenovirus', 'unanimously', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-24 13:44:35+00:00,14,"When Hilda Bastian and I first caught up over Skype to talk about Covid-19 vaccines last autumn, she showed me the boxes and unfinished rooms in her new home in Victoria, Australia. She’d been so busy tracking the global vaccine effort, she hadn’t had time to settle in.

Bastian — an expert in analyzing clinical trial data, founding member of the Cochrane Collaboration, and a former National Institutes of Health official — has gone down rabbit holes before. There was the time she traveled the US on her own dime to research and take historical photos for a Wikipedia list of African American mathematicians.

But her obsession with vaccines in this pandemic has been especially fruitful: She’s called the race right at just about every turn.

Last July, she warned that side effects for some Covid-19 vaccines may be more severe than we’re used to with other shots. At the time, she says, “I copped flak for it.” Also last July, when the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine was the focal point of media coverage, she praised the rigor of clinical trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — the first to receive emergency authorization use in the US — and said it was the one to watch.

On the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, she was among the first to spot the inconsistencies and issues with the clinical trials back in June. She also supported emergency use authorization for Covid-19 vaccines last August, when it was still controversial to do so.

With all her foresight, Bastian has become something of a Zeynep Tufekci on pandemic vaccines. Like the prescient computer programmer turned sociologist, Bastian — who does this work independently and without pay — has seen the state of play more clearly than many others. Her blogs, articles, and Twitter account might also be the most comprehensive look at just about everything published on Covid-19 vaccines anywhere.

The Covid-19 vaccine project was born out of concern for her sons, one of whom is immunocompromised and at higher risk of coronavirus complications. “I wanted to do something useful, and I decided early on I thought that it was likely there would be vaccines,” Bastian told me recently.

But another motivation was frustration: The myopic focus in Western media on Europe’s and America’s vaccine development and rollout missed what was happening in most of the world — in countries like China, Russia, and Cuba, Bastian said. And so much of the coverage was “uncritical of vaccine developers’ marketing hype. ... You couldn’t get an accurate perspective of what was going on, without putting a ton of time into it.”

Nearly a year into her project, I caught up with Bastian to ask where our blind spots are now and how she predicts the vaccine story — and the pandemic — will unfold. She talked about the need for health officials to acknowledge that coronavirus vaccines have potentially “big differences in efficacy and adverse events,” a time in the future when we may need Covid-19 vaccine boosters every year, and the problem of people in rich countries like the US shamelessly hogging vaccines. The transcript of our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Covid-19 arrogance

Julia Belluz

Early in the pandemic, you pointed out how multiple rich countries, especially in the West, were getting their pandemic responses wrong. They were not learning from our Asian-Pacific neighbors, especially when anti-virus measures didn’t fit our preconceived notions. One example is the great mask debate of 2020. What do you think was driving that inability to learn from the experience of Asian-Pacific countries?

Hilda Bastian

Somebody said that people in many rich countries have got used to thinking that they’ve conquered all infectious disease, and so there’s this hubris about that, and I think that we found that hubris was more profound than we realized. We felt far too safe, and there was really quite a great degree of arrogance in there.

I [also] started to think, “This is just racism,” an old colonialist-thinking legacy, discounting Asian science and experience, and that’s a large part of what this whole theme is. Just that assumption that you are Americans or Europeans and know best over and over again. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it should be not to think that anymore, and, yet, people keep doing it.

Julia Belluz

Where do you see that playing out now — the discounting of non-Western or lower-income countries and overestimating the wealthier, Western ones?

Hilda Bastian

It’s happening with vaccines, especially thinking it’s all about the vaccines of a few big EuroAmerican multinationals galloping to the world’s rescue. One of the most fascinating stories is Cuba. I mean, there’s this really interesting juxtaposition between Cuba and Canada, ironically. In Canada [where the vaccine rollout has been slow] there’s a debate about why did they let their capacity to produce vaccines dwindle away to next to nothing.

Cuba had the exact opposite. Cuba had to become self-sufficient at pretty well everything, and that included producing drugs and producing medical teams. Cuba now exports a lot of medical care to poorer countries. The first two of their vaccines are looking really quite good. The first one’s just about to start its big phase 3 trial, and they’ve got three others coming up behind.

They’re going to have a massive amount more vaccine than they need. They’re not going to have any trouble vaccinating their population with home-grown vaccines in 2021. That just does not look remotely like it’s going to be a problem, and, then, they’re just going to be exporting masses and masses of vaccine.

Vaccine hype

Julia Belluz

One vaccine group that there was a ton of hype around — and that has under-delivered — is Oxford/AstraZeneca. It was supposed to be the vaccine that saved poor countries, but now there are manufacturing problems, and questions about the quality of their clinical trial data, including whether the vaccine even works in the highest-risk groups, like people over 65. You were, I think, first to point out the troubling signs in their clinical trials, back in June, and then followed the story in detail. Where do you think that vaccine is going?

Hilda Bastian

I wouldn’t be surprised if the situation got worse, though I hope it will get better. [They went] about their clinical trial program in such a problematic way. [They] overlapped the early phases of their trials too much. They didn’t do early phase tests in older people as a result, leaving us struggling now with the results in a way we don’t have to with other EuroAmerican vaccines.

The publicly available details about the trial kept changing while it was in progress — and didn’t even say clearly what the dose was, for example.

Why on Earth did the UK’s health regulator greenlight these plans?

The really big question about that is why on earth did the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [the UK’s health regulator] greenlight these plans? Maybe people ceased to be critical enough, and they went over a bit of a cliff.

Whether it turns out to be a good vaccine or not, let’s leave that to one side. The clinical trials were, the European Medicines Agency [Europe’s drug regulator] concluded, sub-optimal. That shouldn’t happen. We’re lucky the [Food and Drug Administration] insisted on a large trial. We’ll hear the results soon.

Julia Belluz

We already saw South Africa halt distribution of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine because of preliminary data suggesting it didn’t work as well against the variant that emerged there. If the vaccine doesn’t end up being widely distributed in low and middle-income countries, do you think that gap will be filled maybe by the Russian and Chinese vaccines?

Hilda Bastian

[The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine] is already being widely distributed. But China may already have supplied as much as 1 in 5 of the vaccines administered globally. And China and Russia are the ones who are there first with batches of vaccine in a lot of countries.

The role that people were ascribing to AstraZeneca, I thought always was going to be Johnson & Johnson because [they’re] a huge vaccine company. AstraZeneca is not really a vaccine company. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a single dose. They were also doing trials that were seriously geared at international needs. They ran the biggest trial in the most countries, and that matters a lot to people from different ethnic groups.

Even though the actual doses are a bit more expensive [for Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine], the cost of actually vaccinating people is enormously lower if you’ve only got to vaccinate everybody once. And Johnson & Johnson also committed to affordable, nonprofit vaccine for the emergency. It’s going to depend a lot on how many doses actually get delivered in the end, and what happens with variants. Now it seems likely Novavax may be as big a supplier as well — possibly more than half of the WHO-provided supply.

Julia Belluz

Another vaccine you put a lot of stock in from the start was the one developed by Pfizer/BioNTech — one that got relatively little attention in the US until the big finding of 95 percent efficacy last autumn. Why were you so impressed so early on?

Hilda Bastian

That was because BioNTech was doing such thorough work early on — they were developing several versions, and testing them against each other in early trials. They didn’t have all their eggs in one basket. Then there was the partnership with Pfizer, which was going to give them an important edge in running a massive clinical trial in a pandemic. You had to have both those things — a good vaccine, and a good major trial.

Julia Belluz

Which vaccine group is the next Pfizer/BioNTech?

Hilda Bastian

Novavax is an important one to watch, if the results continue to be as good as their first ones, which were similar to the mRNA vaccines. It’s a more traditional form of vaccine, so there’s more capacity to manufacture it.

There are others that could be important globally, like one from Thailand that will be cheap and both profit- and royalty-free for lower-income countries, and another that UNICEF is supporting that’s also aiming at preventing infection.

Julia Belluz

Can we talk a little more about the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V: The data published in The Lancet looked quite impressive taken at face value — but you weren’t convinced. Can you tell me why?

Hilda Bastian

There wasn’t the kind of data about possible adverse reactions that have become the scientific standard, for example. Trial participants get asked to record a list of specific possible reactions in the first week — things like fever, fatigue, headaches. We know if you don’t do that systematically, you’ll end up with an underestimate and a too-rosy picture of a vaccine. Because they didn’t seem to do that, we’ll stay pretty much in the dark on how tolerable this vaccine is for a while. And there’s a lot that’s not transparent about this trial, because they played it close to the vest with critical details, like the protocol [or pre-established plan] of the trial.

When we saw the report, we could see the age spread, and it was a pretty young group — about 90 percent were under 60, so that’s not where the greatest burden of suffering from this disease is. It was done in Moscow, so there’s little diversity — 99 percent of the participants were white, so that was stark, too. There are going to be more trials outside Russia, and that’s going to help get data we can more easily compare to other vaccines.

We never grappled with what we’ve got, which is vaccines with potentially big differences in efficacy and adverse events

Julia Belluz

So I guess it’s pretty fair to say at this point: The vaccine rollout is shaping up to be quite different from what many of us expected.

Hilda Bastian

Yeah, we never really grappled with what we’ve got, which is, although some people don’t seem to want to face it head-on, vaccines with potentially big differences in efficacy and adverse events. So, what are the priorities, then, for the better vaccines versus the vaccines that have less protection and so on? The situation turned out to be far more complex than the experts prepared us for, I think. Communities have a lot of very tough calls to make, under very different levels of urgency.

Most of the trials haven’t had enough severely ill people to give us a clear picture on how much the vaccines will prevent severe disease, and the differences there might not be as big as other differences. If you’re in a community that’s very vulnerable to major outbreaks, with a limited supply of vaccines, the differences between them are small compared to the risks to ourselves and our communities of being unvaccinated.

Julia Belluz

Doesn’t this raise questions about health officials who are telling the public all vaccines are equal?

Hilda Bastian

Trying to convince people that the vaccines are all equal isn’t going to work. People are making claims that go beyond the solid data we have, and that’s a risky proposition. We’re going to see the differences in rates of adverse events, for example, pretty quickly for ourselves once we know lots of people getting vaccinated.

Especially when the fear of major outbreaks subsides — prematurely — and we’re trying to get younger people to accept vaccination, adverse reactions are going to matter to people.

“The story of the pandemic”

Julia Belluz

Moving forward, what’s the big vaccine issue you’re going to be tracking?

Hilda Bastian

It’s still early days for clinical trials, so I’ll be tracking those and new boosters against variants, as well as what happens in vaccinated communities. [I’m] also watching how the rich countries are cornering vaccines, and those advancing their geopolitics to fill in the gaps — it’s actually quite a horrifying thing.

Very rarely do you see people from one of the rich countries expressing concern that their country may be fully vaccinated within a few months. I’m not utopian and that idealistic about it. It was never 100 percent going to happen that way [that the high priority groups in rich and poor countries got vaccinated at the same levels at the same time, per WHO advice], but I hoped at least for something roughly close, and I’m really quite shocked how comfortable people are with what’s happening.

You can’t buy what’s already gone from the shelves

Some are promoting personal donations to WHO now for vaccines, which just underscores the lack of awareness that the problem is rich countries taking all the doses for ourselves. You can’t buy what’s already gone from the shelves. There are severe limits to what can be produced this year. Even with recent promises of more money for WHO from rich countries, 2021 looks pretty grim.

In a way, for me, that’s the story of the pandemic. We had too many people more concerned about their individual rights or about wearing masks or flying for a vacation, or complaining about the restrictions that they faced, than the consequences of those actions for people more vulnerable than themselves. Now, it’s playing out [with] vaccines, too.

Julia Belluz

From a health perspective, why is hoarding so concerning?

Hilda Bastian

We need to reduce the chances of the virus morphing into more dangerous variants — vaccines might not protect communities enough from new variants sweeping through. And many of the rich countries will have trouble getting enough people vaccinated anyway. The notion that there can be countries where there’s going to be 40-year-olds and 30-year-olds vaccinated while there are terrible outbreaks in other parts of the world, and even the health care practitioners are unprotected, isn’t okay on any level.

Julia Belluz

Even rich countries, though, are having manufacturing and supply issues — like Canada, as you mentioned. Will the world be able to maintain a sustained production capacity for vaccines, or will it see spikes and drops for the next while?

Hilda Bastian

It could settle down, particularly if some of the more traditional forms of vaccine, like the one from Novavax, make it into use and are popular and effective. Vaccines that can tap into more of the existing widespread technical capacity should help. And I guess there’ll be more movement from the big companies that don’t yet have a vaccine of their own.

How does this end?

Julia Belluz

Okay, so now we have multiple effective vaccines on the market, and more coming online soon. But we also have this emerging variant problem and questions about how to use the vaccines we’ve got. Do we know how this pandemic ends?

Hilda Bastian

No, I don’t think we [do]. I don’t think there’s been a pandemic quite like this because they were either that the thing went through and did its worst and left horrific death in its wake, or the smaller ones in more contained areas that are recent.

But this thing on this scale, while there’s this level of antibody-based treatments out there, and vaccines of different efficacy, and all of this stuff that could play in the favor of variants, this situation has never existed before.

I don’t think that the past tells us where this is going. [But] I believe the people who are saying that we appear to be on a course to eventually get to the point where we get vaccinated against this each year. The path to global eradication — through very high levels of vaccination with a high level of other suppression efforts — seems narrow. That could change, though, and I hope it does.

It’s going to depend how disabling long Covid turns out to be, and for how many people

Julia Belluz

Do you have any predictions for long-lasting effects of the pandemic, how it changes society?

Hilda Bastian

For me, one of the things that is a really huge unknown is what happens with long Covid. When I lived in Germany, I was trying to understand why issues for people with disabilities were so much better in Germany than any place I’d ever spent time in, and on a scale that was really quite extraordinary.

Then, I started to read about the history of the disability movement after World War I, that you had such a huge proportion of young men with major disabilities, whether it was sight, limbs missing — and to have such a massive proportion of your population suddenly with disabilities, changed societies. It happened again after World War II. So, I’m thinking about that again, now.

To some extent, it’s going to depend on how disabling long Covid turns out to be, and for how many people? Are we looking at a really serious big wave of decades-long disability? Because if we are, that is a really profound, sudden change in societies.

2021-02-24 12:03:47+00:00,12,"More than 50 million Americans have now gotten their first shot against Covid-19, and 25 million have gotten two shots. There’s strong evidence that the two Covid-19 vaccines Americans are getting — one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other by Moderna — are highly effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite that fact, public health officials and media outlets have been warning that vaccinated people need to behave largely how they did before they were vaccinated. That’s because we don’t know as much about the vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing transmission to others. A vaccinated person may be well-protected from Covid-19, but if they carry the virus, could they possibly infect the people around them?

But a growing body of evidence suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines do, in fact, cut down on viral transmission. Two recent studies show some pretty favorable results — one from the UK that found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut down by 86 percent someone’s chances of developing an infection that they could pass along, the other a study in Israel that found an 89.4 percent reduction (though it should be noted that the Israeli study has yet to be fully released). These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

In other words, even as we wait for more definitive studies on the vaccines’ effects on transmission, more and more scientists think we do have enough information to feel pretty good about the vaccines’ capacity to give us back a semblance of normalcy as we approach a year of life in a pandemic.

In an opinion piece, Johns Hopkins epidemiologists M. Kate Grabowski and Justin Lessler argued, “We are confident vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the chances of transmitting the virus.”

“I have been very cautious due to limited evidence on transmission effects but agree with [Grabowski and Lessler] that a large transmission effect is the best explanation of the limited evidence to date,” Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in February.

In a new preprint, he and Harvard epidemiologist Rebecca Kahn laid out some principles for how to evaluate data from observational studies like the UK and Israel ones. Applying their principles to Moderna data (more on this below), they estimate that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.”

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has sounded an optimistic note. “The looming question is, if the person who’s been vaccinated gets infected, does that person have the capability to transmit it to another person? Some studies are pointing in a very favorable direction,” he said in a White House briefing in mid-February.

Studying exactly how much a vaccine affects transmission is very difficult. It requires exceptionally good contact tracing, which few countries have, or inference from lots of different forms of limited evidence. Uncertainty remains about exactly how much the vaccines reduce transmission — and that uncertainty has led many public health officials to be cautious in their public statements.

But that cautiousness can end up misleading the public, giving people the impression that scientists have no information at all. That, in turn, could also lead to vaccine hesitancy. Some people may think, if I get vaccinated but I still have to continue masking and social distancing at all times, then why get vaccinated at all?

“In their own lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend to be cleareyed about the vaccines. Many are getting shots as soon as they’re offered one. They are urging their family and friends to do the same,” David Leonhardt argues in a New York Times piece. “But when they speak to a national audience, they deliver a message that comes off very differently. It is dominated by talk of risks, uncertainties, caveats and possible problems. It feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation and anxiety.”

The vaccines do reduce transmission. They do take us a big step closer toward life beyond the pandemic. And the messaging from our institutions should start reflecting that.

The two new studies looking at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, explained

Now that many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 — about 50 million in the US — new research is coming out every day that clarifies the transmission picture. Two key new studies look at the rate of disease among people who got two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. That’s an important figure for judging how effective vaccines are for transmission — the lower the rate of infection, the lower the rate of transmission.

A little step back here to explain where things stand on vaccines: There are several vaccines approved in different parts of the world, with various approaches and levels of effectiveness. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were the first to be approved for use in the US, and there’s more data available about them, and to keep the scope of this piece manageable, it will focus on just those two vaccines.

A working paper recently published with The Lancet’s preprint publication program looked at health care workers in the United Kingdom who were vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It finds that the vaccine doesn’t just make people less likely to get symptomatic infections (which we already knew from Pfizer/BioNTech’s initial trials) — it also makes them much much less likely to get infected at all. “Vaccine effectiveness was 72% ... 21 days after first dose and 86% ... 7 days after the second dose,” the study concludes.

That’s lower than the 95 percent headline number you might have seen, but that 95 percent measures symptomatic infections; this measures all infections, even “invisible” asymptomatic ones, through routine testing of healthy people.

Another recent paper, this time out of Israel, looked at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well. (A big caveat: The findings were announced in a press release, but the study itself hasn’t been released yet.) It found a drop of 89.4 percent in infections among people who got two doses of the vaccine, compared to unvaccinated people. We don’t have as much information from this research as we’d like yet, as the paper has yet to be made public, and given the methodological challenges of estimating transmission, the details of the paper matter a lot. But that number is similar to the one from the UK study.

Even though the studies focused only on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there’s reason to believe that the results translate to the Moderna vaccine as well. The two vaccines work very similarly. Both contain a set of instructions to the RNA in our cells to build a protein very similar to the “spike protein” in the coronavirus. Then the immune system notices the intruder and responds, producing antibodies that’ll protect against the coronavirus later.

Because the two vaccines work very similarly, the researchers I spoke to said it was overwhelmingly likely that they both block transmission to a similar degree. As a result, we can assume — though with some uncertainty — that evidence of strong infection reductions from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also likely applies to Moderna.

But even before the most recent research came out, we already knew that the vaccines would help curb transmission. For one thing, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines reduce the chances of getting a symptomatic case of Covid-19 by 94 percent and 95 percent, respectively. That is a promising starting point — if a person doesn’t get Covid-19, then they can’t pass it on.

But what about asymptomatic cases?

In their initial clinical trials, Moderna and Pfizer didn’t study whether vaccinated people got asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 — that is, people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not suffer any symptoms. However, when people went in for their second shot, Moderna did give them a nasal swab test for Covid-19. In a supplement to its submission to the FDA, Moderna says that 14 of the 14,134 vaccinated people had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time) and 38 of the 14,073 people in the control group had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time).

That rules out one big worry about the vaccines: that they might make Covid-19 mild in vaccinated people — so mild they don’t experience any symptoms — without actually preventing it. Instead, it was clear from back in December that the vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection as well as reducing symptomatic infection.

Using Moderna’s nasal swab test data, infectious disease biologist Marm Kilpatrick at UCSC estimated that the vaccine, after a single shot, reduces a person’s odds of infection with Covid-19 by up to 90 percent. (When I emailed him, we determined that with some more pessimistic assumptions, the reduction might be more like 78 to 88 percent.)

Lipsitch and Kahn took a different approach, and estimated from the same data that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.” Of course, the overall efficacy of the vaccine after both doses will almost certainly be higher.

The recent data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel and in the UK backs up that idea. It suggests that after two shots, the vaccine is 85 to 90 percent effective at preventing infection with Covid-19.

There are some caveats. The data from the UK and from Israel comes from observational studies, not randomized controlled trials: If the people who’d been vaccinated differ from people who haven’t, the study’s assumptions might not hold. Researchers do their best to adjust for this, but any adjustment will be imperfect. In addition, getting the vaccine could change behavior — the vaccinated might take more risks, and they might be less likely to seek Covid-19 testing or be required to provide negative test results.

So this estimate shouldn’t be considered definitive. But it lines up with other sources of evidence, and it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is likely highly effective — in the 80 to 90 percent range — at preventing infections. And low infection rates mean low transmission rates.

Viral load and reduced odds of transmission

But let’s say a person who has been vaccinated still gets infected with Covid-19. That’s not great, but the vaccine likely continues to protect the people around them, according to the research so far. That’s because of another consideration: viral load — that is, how much virus can be measured in a patient’s nose and throat.

Not everyone who has Covid-19 is equally likely to transmit it. A study recently published in The Lancet based on research from contact tracing in Spain has found a very strong association between viral load and how many other people the patient infects, as well as how serious the infections in other people are.

This isn’t very surprising. Viral load determines how much virus you are coughing or breathing into the air, which determines whether other people get sick. And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

Don’t go bar-hopping, but having also-vaccinated friends over is likely fine, Dr. Leana Wen of the George Washington School of Public Health argues in the Washington Post. Letting your grandparents hold your kids? Families might reasonably conclude that’s also fine, she says.

Vaccinated people should, of course, respect businesses’ rules about masks — the essential workers asked to enforce those rules have no way to know if you’ve been vaccinated. And while most people are still unvaccinated, the vaccinated should be thoughtful about protecting those who haven’t had a chance at the vaccines yet. But those reminders shouldn’t drown out an accurate understanding of the fact that the vaccines are really effective.

“Advising people that they must do nothing differently after vaccination — not even in the privacy of their homes — creates the misimpression that vaccines offer little benefit at all. Vaccines provide a true reduction of risk, not a false sense of security,” epidemiologist Julia Marcus argued in the Atlantic.

Our recommendations for vaccinated people should reflect our best current understanding of the evidence.

It’s true that there’s still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of the vaccines on transmission. It’s possible that as we learn more from Israel, recommendations will change. And it’s important that people get fully vaccinated — two shots, plus some time for the immunity to fully take hold — before they assume the vaccine has fully protected them and the people around them.

But what’s important to remember is that we aren’t operating from complete ignorance. We know a lot about the vaccines, and what we know points toward them being very effective at reducing transmission and protecting those around us. If you’re hesitant about taking the vaccine because you heard that it might not protect others, you shouldn’t be, because the evidence suggests it does. That message is at least as important as warnings for the vaccinated not to “party.”

Correction, February 24: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who have received the Covid-19 vaccine. Sixty-four million doses had been administered as of the 24th, but since the vaccines approved so far are administered in two doses, 44 million people had received at least one dose by that date.",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'explained', 'vaccinated', 'pfizerbiontech', 'growing', 'study', 'transmission', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'viral', 'reduce', 'data', 'evidence', 'vaccines']",0

And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

Don’t go bar-hopping, but having also-vaccinated friends over is likely fine, Dr. Leana Wen of the George Washington School of Public Health argues in the Washington Post. Letting your grandparents hold your kids? Families might reasonably conclude that’s also fine, she says.

Vaccinated people should, of course, respect businesses’ rules about masks — the essential workers asked to enforce those rules have no way to know if you’ve been vaccinated. And while most people are still unvaccinated, the vaccinated should be thoughtful about protecting those who haven’t had a chance at the vaccines yet. But those reminders shouldn’t drown out an accurate understanding of the fact that the vaccines are really effective.

“Advising people that they must do nothing differently after vaccination — not even in the privacy of their homes — creates the misimpression that vaccines offer little benefit at all. Vaccines provide a true reduction of risk, not a false sense of security,” epidemiologist Julia Marcus argued in the Atlantic.

Our recommendations for vaccinated people should reflect our best current understanding of the evidence.

It’s true that there’s still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of the vaccines on transmission. It’s possible that as we learn more from Israel, recommendations will change. And it’s important that people get fully vaccinated — two shots, plus some time for the immunity to fully take hold — before they assume the vaccine has fully protected them and the people around them.

But what’s important to remember is that we aren’t operating from complete ignorance. We know a lot about the vaccines, and what we know points toward them being very effective at reducing transmission and protecting those around us. If you’re hesitant about taking the vaccine because you heard that it might not protect others, you shouldn’t be, because the evidence suggests it does. That message is at least as important as warnings for the vaccinated not to “party.”

Correction, February 24: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who have received the Covid-19 vaccine. Sixty-four million doses had been administered as of the 24th, but since the vaccines approved so far are administered in two doses, 44 million people had received at least one dose by that date.",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'explained', 'vaccinated', 'pfizerbiontech', 'growing', 'study', 'transmission', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'viral', 'reduce', 'data', 'evidence', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-23 23:19:04+00:00,11,"Maybe early in the pandemic, you first postponed your 2020 vacation to July, and then from July to March. Now, you know you should just wait and see, but you can’t help yourself and went ahead and booked for August.

That’s basically what Congress has been doing with economic aid such as unemployment insurance during the Covid-19 outbreak. Federal lawmakers have been picking arbitrary end dates for much-needed support, more or less guessing at the end of the pandemic for nearly a year. And it appears that in the latest relief package, set to pass Congress in the coming weeks, they’re about to make the same mistake again: Instead of phasing out benefits when the economy gets better, Congress is setting up yet another cliff later this year.

Congress has made important changes to the unemployment system to respond to the pandemic: Initially, it added $600 in federal weekly unemployment benefits through the end of July 2020; that dried up for a while but was reinstated at the end of December, this time adding $300 a week through March 14. The federal government has also expanded unemployment to gig workers, contractors, freelancers, and others who are generally ineligible for such benefits, and has added on extra weeks once regular benefits expire.

A growing chorus of lawmakers and experts argue Congress could further improve jobless benefits by adding something called “automatic stabilizers” into the equation. That would mean that benefits would be tied to certain economic conditions — say, the unemployment rate — and would phase out as the economy gets better. They would be triggered on and off according to what’s actually happening in the economy for businesses and for workers.

“A ton of resources are wasted during a really crucial time ... just having to go through this ad hoc stimulus and relief and recovery, and it just doesn’t have to be like that,” said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the Labor Department. “We can automate things to make it so Congress could step in if they ever needed to do more relief, but it would mean that the basic structure of relief and recovery would be there already.”

“We need to make sure that we are maintaining aid and income support for as long as economic conditions warrant, as long as people need it.”

Proponents of automatic stabilizers have long pushed for Congress to take a serious look at them, especially during the pandemic. When President Joe Biden released his opening bid for his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan, he nodded at the concept, indicating it could finally get its moment in the sun. But it appears automatic triggers will be passed over once again in the legislation, which instead lays out a new date for benefits to expire: August 29. If you read through the bill as it’s taking shape, it’s clear that the federal government’s new assumed end date for the pandemic is September.

“The absence of automatic stabilizers is probably the most important missed opportunity in what is generally an excellent set of proposals,” said Greg Leiserson, director of tax policy and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “We need to make sure that we are maintaining aid and income support for as long as economic conditions warrant, as long as people need it.”

Automatic stabilizers are the best idea left on the table.

The idea behind automatic stabilizers is that they phase out benefits when they are less needed

The government already has in place automatic stabilizers, including unemployment itself, which is intended to stabilize the economy — not only do they replace income for people who lose jobs, but they’re also meant to help prop up the economy in moments of downturn and keep consumer spending going. When an unemployed worker can’t pay their rent, it’s bad for both the tenant and the landlord.

Because the unemployment system has become so whittled down over the years, benefits are less effective at supporting the economy than they used to be — food stamps tend to be more impactful — but it varies by state. “Unemployment insurance is a much better stabilizer in Massachusetts and New Jersey than it is in Texas and Virginia,” said Wayne Vroman, a labor economist at the Urban Institute.

But with federal interventions during the pandemic, that has changed somewhat, at least temporarily. Expanded unemployment benefits appear to have been quite useful in helping people spend what they need, which in turn helps businesses dependent on those customers. Research shows they actually helped many people with savings, and they likely made the recession less severe. They also reduced some inequalities in how Black and white workers access benefits and the amount of benefits they receive. This makes the argument that they should continue as long as the crisis continues make sense.

“The idea that more recession spending should be on autopilot rather than dependent on the whims of politicians seems to be a good one whether you’re a hawk or a dove,” said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Budget, which advocates for deficit reduction. “It’s sort of, in theory, a no-brainer.”

The idea of putting in place triggers for programs such as unemployment insurance has existed long before the pandemic. The Great Recession, during which Congress re-upped unemployment insurance more than a dozen times, made the potential appeal of automatic triggers quite obvious. In 2019, well before the pandemic hit, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) released a sweeping plan for using automatic stabilizers to combat recessions as part of his Democratic presidential bid. Also in 2019, the Brookings Institution think tank released a paper arguing for automatically increasing federal spending on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) when a state’s unemployment level hits a certain level.

“The idea that more recession spending should be on autopilot rather than dependent on the whims of politicians seems to be a good one whether you’re a hawk or a dove.”

The unpredictability of the Covid-19 outbreak — and the federal government’s inadequate response to the health end of it — has made the discussion around automatic stabilizers even more pertinent. The initial extra $600 in federal benefits from the CARES Act ended on July 31, leaving unemployed workers dependent on state benefits alone for months, even though the pandemic wasn’t over. State payouts can vary widely: according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, before the pandemic, average weekly benefits for unemployed workers in Massachusetts were $550, while for those in Mississippi, they were just $215. Congress and then-President Donald Trump procrastinated so much on the $900 billion stimulus package passed in December that some unemployment programs were interrupted, leaving many workers in limbo. That bill added on an extra $300 in unemployment insurance benefits until March 14, when Congress is facing another cliff yet again.

“Waiting until the very eleventh hour to extend the pandemic unemployment insurance programs, there have been millions of people who saw the lapses in benefits,” Shierholz said. “To lawmakers who have a cushion in their bank accounts and if they don’t get paid for a couple of weeks they’re fine, that is not the case for most people.”

Some states already automatically extend benefits to workers when the unemployment rate is high, but it’s less than half of states, and that doesn’t increase the amount.

There are trigger proposals in Congress. There’s also pushback.

The question of how to design an automatic stabilizer program isn’t an easy one — what’s the best metric to decide when things are back to normal enough to start to phase out benefits is hard to say. But there are certainly proposals out there.

In 2020, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced legislation that would have tied unemployment insurance to the economic conditions of each state and gradually phase out expanded federal benefits as a state’s unemployment rate dropped. Sen. Bennet has continued to advocate for automatic stabilizers, including joining with Reps. Don Beyer (D-VA) and Derek Kilmer (D-WA) and Sen. Jack Reed (D-MI) on a framework to include them in legislation also tied to state unemployment rates. There was some hope that automatic stabilizers would wind up in the HEROES Act, the follow-up stimulus package House Democrats passed in May, but they did not. Ezra Klein wrote about it for Vox at the time and noted how popular the concept behind automatic stabilizers appeared to be in polling.

When Biden won the White House and Democrats narrowly took control of the Senate, there was renewed hope that automatic triggers would be made part of a new Covid relief package. Many members of Biden’s economic team have previously expressed some support for them. But it appears they’re about to be left out of the $1.9 trillion package making its way through Congress, which instead adds on $400 in federal weekly benefits and extends expanded benefits through roughly the end of August.

One major obstacle congressional Democrats point to how the Congressional Budget Office could score automatic stabilizers in a relief bill and concerns they’ll just be too expensive. A potential $1 trillion to $2 trillion price tag from the CBO is something many lawmakers find hard to stomach, even if it is contemplating a somewhat unlikely worst-case scenario where unemployment remains super high.

“The bottom line is there are just members of the caucus who are very, very focused on a topline score, and doing stabilizers on unemployment insurance would certainly add a ton of money to the score,” one Democratic aide said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pointed to concerns about a potential CBO score for automatic stabilizers when they were excluded from the HEROES Act in May.

The counterargument is that it’s money that is going to be spent anyway — Congress is going to keep extending unemployment benefits until the crisis is over.

“The CBO scores show just how deep of an economic hole we’re climbing out of,” said Sen. Wyden in a statement to Vox. “The score would not be high if there was not unprecedented need. If vaccinations continue to pick up and the economic picture improves faster than projected, the score would be lower than projected. When you ask Democrats whether they would support extending benefits if they are still needed, the overwhelming response is ‘yes.’ So my colleagues are willing to provide the relief that’s needed. It’s just the score that is the obstacle.”

Leiserson echoed the point: The CBO score is reflective of the scale of the problem. “It’s ultimately a program we need, and to use that as a reason that we can’t have it is to confuse the indication of what we need to do with a reason not to do it,” he said. “The price tag isn’t telling you whether we need it, it’s just telling you the price tag of the thing we need.”

Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the CBO, noted that there is, of course, a chance that the coronavirus mutates, rendering the vaccine ineffective, and unemployment remains persistently high for a long time. It’s a possibility, though not a probability, that the CBO would contemplate. She said that Congress could work with the agency to calibrate expected values. “There are certainly ways to make this not scary,” she said. “But what’s frustrating is that if indeed all those bad things happen ... policymakers should be thrilled that they set policy to keep unemployment insurance benefits really generous to help people through those incredibly difficult times.”

Plus, if the economy gets better faster than anticipated, benefits can phase out faster, too, meaning the price tag goes down, which saves the government money.

None of this is to say that figuring out how automatic stabilizers should work is super simple. The unemployment rate has fallen more sharply than many economists expected at the outset of the pandemic, in part because millions of people have dropped out of the labor force, and initial proposals on how to scale down benefits didn’t really take that into account. Some economists have suggested triggers be tied to other indicators, such as vaccinations.

“Congress wants to keep a hand in because it wants to take credit for doing something in a recession.”

Vroman, whose work is focused on unemployment insurance, doesn’t believe a fully automated system for turning stabilizers on and off all of the time would be feasible. “In any given year, the range of unemployment across the country is really very, very wide, so the need for stimulus in more industrial areas is a lot greater than in areas that have mainly service jobs or even agricultural jobs that aren’t really linked to aggregate output,” he said.

He added that there’s also the issue that Congress doesn’t want to give up the reins: “One of the biggest constraints is that the Congress wants to keep a hand in because it wants to take credit for doing something in a recession. Having something that’s fully automatic would remove them from that process.”

Why do we keep guessing at the end of the pandemic?

Everyone would like to believe the pandemic will be over sooner rather than later. That’s been true since the lockdowns began. But the country is now nearly a year into this, and it’s time to stop predicting. Nobody has insight into exactly when the virus will be under control or when the economy will really be better, and not just the topline numbers, but for everyone.

Democrats now are talking about the urgency of passing a new relief package before the latest unemployment cliff arrives in March. But they’re already setting up another cliff in late summer.

Proponents of automatic stabilizers say they’re not giving up on them, even if the triggers don’t make it into this package. “We are working behind the scenes to get the number of people on board that we need to have on board,” one Democratic aide said. They expressed some hope it might show up in the follow-up recovery package the president is set to unveil, though they acknowledged that support from the White House for automatic stabilizers hasn’t been as enthusiastic as it could be. “The administration so far has made gestures in the direction of support, but they haven’t landed on a full-throated endorsement that this is what they want.”

Still, the question remains: If not now, when?

For unemployed workers facing a tough job market, it’s stressful not to know whether benefits will end, or whether Congress will again procrastinate so much that their benefits are delayed or they have to start over. While Democrats say they will surely again act on unemployment insurance if necessary when the next cliff arrives, that’s not entirely reassuring — after all, it didn’t happen last summer when the extra $600 wrapped.

Biden and Democrats are, in many ways, going big on the economy. It’s hard not to ask why they’re not doing so here. Instead of deciding whether to again help workers who need it in August, they can decide right now.",voxdotcom,"['federal', 'idea', 'stabilizers', 'leaving', 'benefits', 'unemployment', 'relief', 'stimulus', 'democrats', 'table', 'best', 'congress', 'need', 'insurance', 'automatic', 'pandemic']",0
2021-02-23 22:31:48+00:00,18,"More than 50 million Americans have now gotten their first shot against Covid-19, and 25 million have gotten two shots. There’s strong evidence that the two Covid-19 vaccines Americans are getting — one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other by Moderna — are highly effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite that fact, public health officials and media outlets have been warning that vaccinated people need to behave largely how they did before they were vaccinated. That’s because we don’t know as much about the vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing transmission to others. A vaccinated person may be well-protected from Covid-19, but if they carry the virus, could they possibly infect the people around them?

But a growing body of evidence suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines do, in fact, cut down on viral transmission. Two recent studies show some pretty favorable results — one from the UK that found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut down by 86 percent someone’s chances of developing an infection that they could pass along, the other a study in Israel that found an 89.4 percent reduction (though it should be noted that the Israeli study has yet to be fully released). These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

In other words, even as we wait for more definitive studies on the vaccines’ effects on transmission, more and more scientists think we do have enough information to feel pretty good about the vaccines’ capacity to give us back a semblance of normalcy as we approach a year of life in a pandemic.

In an opinion piece, Johns Hopkins epidemiologists M. Kate Grabowski and Justin Lessler argued, “We are confident vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the chances of transmitting the virus.”

“I have been very cautious due to limited evidence on transmission effects but agree with [Grabowski and Lessler] that a large transmission effect is the best explanation of the limited evidence to date,” Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in February.

In a new preprint, he and Harvard epidemiologist Rebecca Kahn laid out some principles for how to evaluate data from observational studies like the UK and Israel ones. Applying their principles to Moderna data (more on this below), they estimate that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.”

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has sounded an optimistic note. “The looming question is, if the person who’s been vaccinated gets infected, does that person have the capability to transmit it to another person? Some studies are pointing in a very favorable direction,” he said in a White House briefing in mid-February.

Studying exactly how much a vaccine affects transmission is very difficult. It requires exceptionally good contact tracing, which few countries have, or inference from lots of different forms of limited evidence. Uncertainty remains about exactly how much the vaccines reduce transmission — and that uncertainty has led many public health officials to be cautious in their public statements.

But that cautiousness can end up misleading the public, giving people the impression that scientists have no information at all. That, in turn, could also lead to vaccine hesitancy. Some people may think, if I get vaccinated but I still have to continue masking and social distancing at all times, then why get vaccinated at all?

“In their own lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend to be cleareyed about the vaccines. Many are getting shots as soon as they’re offered one. They are urging their family and friends to do the same,” David Leonhardt argues in a New York Times piece. “But when they speak to a national audience, they deliver a message that comes off very differently. It is dominated by talk of risks, uncertainties, caveats and possible problems. It feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation and anxiety.”

The vaccines do reduce transmission. They do take us a big step closer toward life beyond the pandemic. And the messaging from our institutions should start reflecting that.

The two new studies looking at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, explained

Now that many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 — about 50 million in the US — new research is coming out every day that clarifies the transmission picture. Two key new studies look at the rate of disease among people who got two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. That’s an important figure for judging how effective vaccines are for transmission — the lower the rate of infection, the lower the rate of transmission.

A little step back here to explain where things stand on vaccines: There are several vaccines approved in different parts of the world, with various approaches and levels of effectiveness. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were the first to be approved for use in the US, and there’s more data available about them, and to keep the scope of this piece manageable, it will focus on just those two vaccines.

A working paper recently published with The Lancet’s preprint publication program looked at health care workers in the United Kingdom who were vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It finds that the vaccine doesn’t just make people less likely to get symptomatic infections (which we already knew from Pfizer/BioNTech’s initial trials) — it also makes them much much less likely to get infected at all. “Vaccine effectiveness was 72% ... 21 days after first dose and 86% ... 7 days after the second dose,” the study concludes.

That’s lower than the 95 percent headline number you might have seen, but that 95 percent measures symptomatic infections; this measures all infections, even “invisible” asymptomatic ones, through routine testing of healthy people.

Another recent paper, this time out of Israel, looked at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well. (A big caveat: The findings were announced in a press release, but the study itself hasn’t been released yet.) It found a drop of 89.4 percent in infections among people who got two doses of the vaccine, compared to unvaccinated people. We don’t have as much information from this research as we’d like yet, as the paper has yet to be made public, and given the methodological challenges of estimating transmission, the details of the paper matter a lot. But that number is similar to the one from the UK study.

Even though the studies focused only on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there’s reason to believe that the results translate to the Moderna vaccine as well. The two vaccines work very similarly. Both contain a set of instructions to the RNA in our cells to build a protein very similar to the “spike protein” in the coronavirus. Then the immune system notices the intruder and responds, producing antibodies that’ll protect against the coronavirus later.

Because the two vaccines work very similarly, the researchers I spoke to said it was overwhelmingly likely that they both block transmission to a similar degree. As a result, we can assume — though with some uncertainty — that evidence of strong infection reductions from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also likely applies to Moderna.

But even before the most recent research came out, we already knew that the vaccines would help curb transmission. For one thing, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines reduce the chances of getting a symptomatic case of Covid-19 by 94 percent and 95 percent, respectively. That is a promising starting point — if a person doesn’t get Covid-19, then they can’t pass it on.

But what about asymptomatic cases?

In their initial clinical trials, Moderna and Pfizer didn’t study whether vaccinated people got asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 — that is, people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not suffer any symptoms. However, when people went in for their second shot, Moderna did give them a nasal swab test for Covid-19. In a supplement to its submission to the FDA, Moderna says that 14 of the 14,134 vaccinated people had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time) and 38 of the 14,073 people in the control group had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time).

That rules out one big worry about the vaccines: that they might make Covid-19 mild in vaccinated people — so mild they don’t experience any symptoms — without actually preventing it. Instead, it was clear from back in December that the vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection as well as reducing symptomatic infection.

Using Moderna’s nasal swab test data, infectious disease biologist Marm Kilpatrick at UCSC estimated that the vaccine, after a single shot, reduces a person’s odds of infection with Covid-19 by up to 90 percent. (When I emailed him, we determined that with some more pessimistic assumptions, the reduction might be more like 78 to 88 percent.)

Lipsitch and Kahn took a different approach, and estimated from the same data that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.” Of course, the overall efficacy of the vaccine after both doses will almost certainly be higher.

The recent data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel and in the UK backs up that idea. It suggests that after two shots, the vaccine is 85 to 90 percent effective at preventing infection with Covid-19.

There are some caveats. The data from the UK and from Israel comes from observational studies, not randomized controlled trials: If the people who’d been vaccinated differ from people who haven’t, the study’s assumptions might not hold. Researchers do their best to adjust for this, but any adjustment will be imperfect. In addition, getting the vaccine could change behavior — the vaccinated might take more risks, and they might be less likely to seek Covid-19 testing or be required to provide negative test results.

So this estimate shouldn’t be considered definitive. But it lines up with other sources of evidence, and it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is likely highly effective — in the 80 to 90 percent range — at preventing infections. And low infection rates mean low transmission rates.

Viral load and reduced odds of transmission

But let’s say a person who has been vaccinated still gets infected with Covid-19. That’s not great, but the vaccine likely continues to protect the people around them, according to the research so far. That’s because of another consideration: viral load — that is, how much virus can be measured in a patient’s nose and throat.

Not everyone who has Covid-19 is equally likely to transmit it. A study recently published in The Lancet based on research from contact tracing in Spain has found a very strong association between viral load and how many other people the patient infects, as well as how serious the infections in other people are.

This isn’t very surprising. Viral load determines how much virus you are coughing or breathing into the air, which determines whether other people get sick. And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

Don’t go bar-hopping, but having also-vaccinated friends over is likely fine, Dr. Leana Wen of the George Washington School of Public Health argues in the Washington Post. Letting your grandparents hold your kids? Families might reasonably conclude that’s also fine, she says.

Vaccinated people should, of course, respect businesses’ rules about masks — the essential workers asked to enforce those rules have no way to know if you’ve been vaccinated. And while most people are still unvaccinated, the vaccinated should be thoughtful about protecting those who haven’t had a chance at the vaccines yet. But those reminders shouldn’t drown out an accurate understanding of the fact that the vaccines are really effective.

“Advising people that they must do nothing differently after vaccination — not even in the privacy of their homes — creates the misimpression that vaccines offer little benefit at all. Vaccines provide a true reduction of risk, not a false sense of security,” epidemiologist Julia Marcus argued in the Atlantic.

Our recommendations for vaccinated people should reflect our best current understanding of the evidence.

It’s true that there’s still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of the vaccines on transmission. It’s possible that as we learn more from Israel, recommendations will change. And it’s important that people get fully vaccinated — two shots, plus some time for the immunity to fully take hold — before they assume the vaccine has fully protected them and the people around them.

But what’s important to remember is that we aren’t operating from complete ignorance. We know a lot about the vaccines, and what we know points toward them being very effective at reducing transmission and protecting those around us. If you’re hesitant about taking the vaccine because you heard that it might not protect others, you shouldn’t be, because the evidence suggests it does. That message is at least as important as warnings for the vaccinated not to “party.”

Correction, February 24: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who have received the Covid-19 vaccine. Sixty-four million doses had been administered as of the 24th, but since the vaccines approved so far are administered in two doses, 44 million people had received at least one dose by that date.",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'explained', 'vaccinated', 'pfizerbiontech', 'growing', 'study', 'transmission', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'viral', 'reduce', 'data', 'evidence', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-23 21:30:24+00:00,29,"We’ve reached half a million deaths from the coronavirus in the US. But most of these deaths — and the grueling medical ordeals leading up to them — have remained largely hidden from view. The majority of terminally ill Covid-19 patients typically spend their last days or weeks isolated in ICUs to keep the virus from spreading.

“Most of what I’m seeing is behind closed curtains, and the general public isn’t seeing this side of it,” says Todd Rice, a critical care and pulmonology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Even “families are only seeing a little bit of it,” he says. As a result, most of us have been “protected and sheltered from seeing the worst of this disease.”

So what have these 500,000 people endured as the infection took over and their bodies failed? The terrible details have been strikingly absent from most of our personal and national discussions about the virus. But if we have been thus far (perhaps somewhat willfully) blind to the excruciating ways Covid-19 takes lives, this milestone is an opportunity to open our eyes.

Four physicians, who collectively have cared for more than 100 dying Covid-19 patients over the past 11 months, shared with Vox what their patients have gone through physically and mentally as the virus killed them. Their experiences reveal the isolating and invasive realities of what it is typically like for someone to die from Covid-19.

Lungs “full of bees” and a “sense of impending doom”

The torture of Covid-19 can begin long before someone is sick enough to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.

Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, it hampers the intake of oxygen. People with worsening Covid-19 typically show up in the emergency room because they are having trouble breathing.

As their lungs deteriorate further, they have a harder and harder time getting enough oxygen with each breath, meaning they need to breathe faster and faster — up from an average of about 14 times per minute to 30 or 40. Such gasping can bring about a very real sense of panic.

Imagine trying to breathe through a very narrow straw, says Jess Mandel, chief of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine at UC San Diego Health. “You can do that for 15 to 20 seconds, but try doing it for two hours.” Or for days or weeks.

Patients struggling through low oxygen levels like this have told Kenneth Remy, an assistant professor of critical care medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, that it feels like a band across their chest or that their lungs are on fire. Or like a thousand bees stinging them inside their chest. Others might have thick secretions in their lungs that make it feel like they are trying to breathe through muck. Many people say it feels like they’re being smothered.

The ordeal is so taxing that many wish for death. “You hear the patients say, ‘I just want to die because this is so excruciating,’” Remy says. “That’s what this virus does.”

“I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy”

Others feel that death is coming no matter what they do. Rice notes that is much more so for his Covid-19 patients than others he has treated. There seems to be something about Covid-19, he says, “that makes people prone to having a feeling of, ‘I really believe I’m going to die.’”

Meilinh Thi, who specializes in critical care and pulmonology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, has witnessed the same thing. “A lot of patients, regardless of age, have this sense of impending doom,” Thi says. Many have told her outright they felt like they were going to die. Eerily, “Everyone who has told me that has passed away,” she says.

Isolated

The agony of being critically ill with Covid-19 isn’t just borne by the body but also by the mind. “It doesn’t only put your lungs on fire or give you a horrible headache or make you feel miserable or make you breathe really fast,” Remy says. “It also wreaks havoc on your mental state.”

For one, from the time anyone with Covid-19 is admitted to the hospital, they are essentially cut off from almost everything that is familiar. Most Covid-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that some are also dying in long-term care facilities (about 10 percent) or at home (about 6 percent).

“A lot of patients have told me how isolating and how lonely it is,” Thi says. And many get depressed. It is also incredibly scary to reach that point of illness with a disease that we know has already killed so many people, she and others point out.

All of these challenges have a cumulative effect. “If you can understand being in the hospital for two, three weeks, continuously breathing that fast, not having good interactions with your family because they can’t come and visit you — it’s extremely anxiety-provoking. It’s scary,” Remy says.

Being in the ICU for any reason also vastly increases a person’s risk for delirium, a state of confusion that can result in agitation, fear, and anger. Medications used to sedate people or relieve pain (both common in Covid-19 treatment) are part of the reason for this risk, as are the constant monitoring and physical disturbances — and subsequent sleep disruption.

Being a Covid-19 patient increases this likelihood of disorientation even more. Some estimates put the rate of delirium among adult ICU Covid-19 patients at about 65 percent.

One reason for this extra risk is that the only people patients see are covered in head-to-toe PPE, often with only their eye area visible behind a shield or goggles, rendering them even more anonymous and unfamiliar. (ICU nurses have described working alongside the same people for decades and now not recognizing them due to all the protective gear.) “That for sure increases the risk of delirium,” Thi says.

As a Covid-19 patient, “You’re just devoid of human contact to a large degree,” Mandel says.

And that is no small thing. With loved ones relegated to video calls, personal connection through in-person visits — typically a mainstay during an intensive hospital stay — is gone.

“If your mom or dad or spouse was in the hospital and was very sick, you would be at their bedside holding their hand,” Remy says. With fatal Covid-19, your last meaningful contact with family, before your final hours, might be as you get admitted into the ER, days or weeks before.

Doctors often have to use many invasive procedures to try to save lives

Anyone unwell enough to be in the ICU for any reason will be hooked up to lots of machines. But people with severe Covid-19 face a particularly grueling and invasive experience.

When people can no longer breathe for themselves and still aren’t getting enough oxygen from external sources (like short nose tubes or a BiPap machine, like those some people wear for sleep apnea), the next step is usually putting them on a ventilator.

To do this, patients are put on IV-based sedation and pain medication so they can tolerate the procedure. A tube is inserted into the mouth and down the airway so the machine can pump air into the lungs. The tube can remain there for days or weeks, during which time that person will remain heavily sedated and unable to talk. (This sedation can also mask other problems that arise during their illness, such as major strokes.)

“The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around”

Those who have survived the ordeal often don’t even remember the day leading up to being put on ventilation, Thi says. “They say they really just lost that portion of their life.”

The ventilator itself is not without risks. For example, if the machine is set to deliver too much air, it can cause additional lung damage. And the breathing tube only tends to be safe to keep in place for about two to three weeks, Thi notes. After that, it can start to deteriorate. At that point, doctors might surgically insert a tube into the patient’s neck — a procedure known as a tracheostomy — to connect them to the ventilator.

For some, even mechanical ventilation can’t get them enough oxygen. These patients often get put on “heart-lung” machines, which pump blood out of the body, through a machine that oxygenates it, and back in. (These are also sometimes used for people who have suffered a heart attack, and are known to have numerous side effects, such as increased risk for strokes as well as for agitation and delirium.) This process requires two large catheters (long tubes) inserted into a major artery or vein, so the machine can effectively pump enough blood in and out of the body.

Flipping people onto their stomachs has also helped get more air into their systems. During this practice, called proning, the sick individual is typically put on a medication to paralyze them so they cannot move. (Medical staff also turn incapacitated patients in bed every couple of hours “to make sure their skin doesn’t break down,” Thi says.)

A significant proportion of people — somewhere between about 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 — who get very sick with Covid-19 also end up with kidney failure. To prevent this from killing them, they’re put on dialysis machines, which take blood out of the body and filter it before returning it to the body. This procedure can cause nausea, cramping, and chronic itching. Anyone getting dialysis will need two additional large catheters put into another major blood vessel.

But these aren’t all of the tubes critically ill Covid-19 patients need. ﻿They also have a central venous catheter to administer medication. This long tube usually gets inserted into a major vein in the clavicle or groin, then is pushed through the vein until it reaches the heart, where it will stay until that person recovers or dies. Another catheter, sometimes put in near the groin, will take the person’s blood for analysis.

Other catheters will be inserted into the urethra to drain urine (which is monitored closely) and the rectum to frequently evacuate their feces (which is especially important because Covid-19 often causes diarrhea). Additional IVs, such as for hydration and medications, will poke patients in smaller vessels as well. People this ill with Covid-19 will also have a tube put into their mouth or nose and down into their stomach, to deliver a nutritious slurry to prevent malnutrition.

On top of all of these tubes and needles, a number of other beeping and humming devices monitor a person’s vitals. Leads attached to the chest track heart function, and a pulse oximeter on the finger keeps tabs on oxygen saturation. A standard cuff monitors blood pressure, but people often get an additional catheter into yet another vessel to measure blood pressure from within that artery.

All of these incredibly invasive interventions have a goal of sustaining the body simply so that it can try to fight off the virus and heal. “The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around,” Mandel says. “It’s always a race.”

But even all of these procedures — alongside treatments like dexamethasone and remdesivir — are not enough to save everyone with Covid-19. Some people decline to go through some or all of this, or at least to endure it indefinitely, but that does not guarantee a lack of suffering. And for those most unlucky 1.8 percent of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in the US, death will then be imminent.

The end

Once someone is sick enough with Covid-19 that they need a ventilator, their chance of survival is somewhere between 40 and 60 percent, notes Remy. “You flip a coin, and you may be one of those people who die,” he says.

Remy recalls one particularly difficult week during the fall surge when he cared for a number of people in their 40s and 50s who ultimately died. Most of them were obese but otherwise healthy when they caught Covid-19 by not wearing a mask.

“One of the[se] patients specifically told me before I put the breathing tube in, ‘Let everyone know that this is real, my lungs are on fire. It’s like there’s bees stinging me. I can’t breathe. Please let them know to wear a mask ... because I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.’”

Right after that patient died, Remy made a precautionary video that he posted on Twitter.

Please listen as this is dire. I don’t want to be the last person that looks in your frightened eyes. #MaskUp ⁦@DrKenRemy1⁩ ⁦@WUSTLmed⁩ pic.twitter.com/qwb4eERlfE — Kenneth E. Remy, MD, MHSc, FCCM (@DrKenRemy1) November 21, 2020

If a patient’s breathing deteriorates slowly, hospitals can often arrange a way for them to talk with family members before they get intubated. Because after the tube goes in, they might not be conscious or able to talk again before they die. Regardless, the last person they have conscious contact with is typically a member of the medical staff before they are heavily sedated to receive the ventilator tube. In essence, “It could be anybody,” Rice says.

Despite the strict isolation for Covid-19 patients, “We try to make sure patients don’t die alone,” Thi says. For those who quickly nosedive, there often isn’t time to bring in family. Those people die surrounded by medical staff, either receiving CPR or, if they had do not resuscitate orders, with staff standing by.

For those who fall toward death, family — in full PPE — are now typically allowed in (which wasn’t usually the case at the beginning of the pandemic). At that point, “We would proceed with comfort measures only,” Thi says. In this scenario, the dying person will be on heavy medication as the ventilator tube is removed. Even still, once it gets taken out, people often gasp or cough as the body fights for air before they die.

Despite the palliative care and the possibility for family to now be present for a person’s actual death, doctors describe Covid-19 as a uniquely terrible way to die. “Covid is just so different,” Thi says. “I don’t think anything could be comparable to it. ... I don’t wish it on my worst enemy.”

Remy agrees. After having cared for patients dying from infectious diseases all over the world, he says, “I don’t know a disease that wreaks such havoc on the body and on the mind.” Which is perhaps why his dying patient was pleading with him so desperately just before being intubated to tell people to wear their masks and take the virus seriously.

Because otherwise, it will continue to take thousands of lives this way each day in the US until we can get vaccines to almost everyone.

2021-02-23 20:28:41+00:00,6,"More than 50 million Americans have now gotten their first shot against Covid-19, and 25 million have gotten two shots. There’s strong evidence that the two Covid-19 vaccines Americans are getting — one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other by Moderna — are highly effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite that fact, public health officials and media outlets have been warning that vaccinated people need to behave largely how they did before they were vaccinated. That’s because we don’t know as much about the vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing transmission to others. A vaccinated person may be well-protected from Covid-19, but if they carry the virus, could they possibly infect the people around them?

But a growing body of evidence suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines do, in fact, cut down on viral transmission. Two recent studies show some pretty favorable results — one from the UK that found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut down by 86 percent someone’s chances of developing an infection that they could pass along, the other a study in Israel that found an 89.4 percent reduction (though it should be noted that the Israeli study has yet to be fully released). These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

In other words, even as we wait for more definitive studies on the vaccines’ effects on transmission, more and more scientists think we do have enough information to feel pretty good about the vaccines’ capacity to give us back a semblance of normalcy as we approach a year of life in a pandemic.

In an opinion piece, Johns Hopkins epidemiologists M. Kate Grabowski and Justin Lessler argued, “We are confident vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the chances of transmitting the virus.”

“I have been very cautious due to limited evidence on transmission effects but agree with [Grabowski and Lessler] that a large transmission effect is the best explanation of the limited evidence to date,” Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in February.

In a new preprint, he and Harvard epidemiologist Rebecca Kahn laid out some principles for how to evaluate data from observational studies like the UK and Israel ones. Applying their principles to Moderna data (more on this below), they estimate that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.”

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has sounded an optimistic note. “The looming question is, if the person who’s been vaccinated gets infected, does that person have the capability to transmit it to another person? Some studies are pointing in a very favorable direction,” he said in a White House briefing in mid-February.

Studying exactly how much a vaccine affects transmission is very difficult. It requires exceptionally good contact tracing, which few countries have, or inference from lots of different forms of limited evidence. Uncertainty remains about exactly how much the vaccines reduce transmission — and that uncertainty has led many public health officials to be cautious in their public statements.

But that cautiousness can end up misleading the public, giving people the impression that scientists have no information at all. That, in turn, could also lead to vaccine hesitancy. Some people may think, if I get vaccinated but I still have to continue masking and social distancing at all times, then why get vaccinated at all?

“In their own lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend to be cleareyed about the vaccines. Many are getting shots as soon as they’re offered one. They are urging their family and friends to do the same,” David Leonhardt argues in a New York Times piece. “But when they speak to a national audience, they deliver a message that comes off very differently. It is dominated by talk of risks, uncertainties, caveats and possible problems. It feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation and anxiety.”

The vaccines do reduce transmission. They do take us a big step closer toward life beyond the pandemic. And the messaging from our institutions should start reflecting that.

The two new studies looking at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, explained

Now that many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 — about 50 million in the US — new research is coming out every day that clarifies the transmission picture. Two key new studies look at the rate of disease among people who got two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. That’s an important figure for judging how effective vaccines are for transmission — the lower the rate of infection, the lower the rate of transmission.

A little step back here to explain where things stand on vaccines: There are several vaccines approved in different parts of the world, with various approaches and levels of effectiveness. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were the first to be approved for use in the US, and there’s more data available about them, and to keep the scope of this piece manageable, it will focus on just those two vaccines.

A working paper recently published with The Lancet’s preprint publication program looked at health care workers in the United Kingdom who were vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It finds that the vaccine doesn’t just make people less likely to get symptomatic infections (which we already knew from Pfizer/BioNTech’s initial trials) — it also makes them much much less likely to get infected at all. “Vaccine effectiveness was 72% ... 21 days after first dose and 86% ... 7 days after the second dose,” the study concludes.

That’s lower than the 95 percent headline number you might have seen, but that 95 percent measures symptomatic infections; this measures all infections, even “invisible” asymptomatic ones, through routine testing of healthy people.

Another recent paper, this time out of Israel, looked at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well. (A big caveat: The findings were announced in a press release, but the study itself hasn’t been released yet.) It found a drop of 89.4 percent in infections among people who got two doses of the vaccine, compared to unvaccinated people. We don’t have as much information from this research as we’d like yet, as the paper has yet to be made public, and given the methodological challenges of estimating transmission, the details of the paper matter a lot. But that number is similar to the one from the UK study.

Even though the studies focused only on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there’s reason to believe that the results translate to the Moderna vaccine as well. The two vaccines work very similarly. Both contain a set of instructions to the RNA in our cells to build a protein very similar to the “spike protein” in the coronavirus. Then the immune system notices the intruder and responds, producing antibodies that’ll protect against the coronavirus later.

Because the two vaccines work very similarly, the researchers I spoke to said it was overwhelmingly likely that they both block transmission to a similar degree. As a result, we can assume — though with some uncertainty — that evidence of strong infection reductions from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also likely applies to Moderna.

But even before the most recent research came out, we already knew that the vaccines would help curb transmission. For one thing, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines reduce the chances of getting a symptomatic case of Covid-19 by 94 percent and 95 percent, respectively. That is a promising starting point — if a person doesn’t get Covid-19, then they can’t pass it on.

But what about asymptomatic cases?

In their initial clinical trials, Moderna and Pfizer didn’t study whether vaccinated people got asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 — that is, people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not suffer any symptoms. However, when people went in for their second shot, Moderna did give them a nasal swab test for Covid-19. In a supplement to its submission to the FDA, Moderna says that 14 of the 14,134 vaccinated people had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time) and 38 of the 14,073 people in the control group had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time).

That rules out one big worry about the vaccines: that they might make Covid-19 mild in vaccinated people — so mild they don’t experience any symptoms — without actually preventing it. Instead, it was clear from back in December that the vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection as well as reducing symptomatic infection.

Using Moderna’s nasal swab test data, infectious disease biologist Marm Kilpatrick at UCSC estimated that the vaccine, after a single shot, reduces a person’s odds of infection with Covid-19 by up to 90 percent. (When I emailed him, we determined that with some more pessimistic assumptions, the reduction might be more like 78 to 88 percent.)

Lipsitch and Kahn took a different approach, and estimated from the same data that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.” Of course, the overall efficacy of the vaccine after both doses will almost certainly be higher.

The recent data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel and in the UK backs up that idea. It suggests that after two shots, the vaccine is 85 to 90 percent effective at preventing infection with Covid-19.

There are some caveats. The data from the UK and from Israel comes from observational studies, not randomized controlled trials: If the people who’d been vaccinated differ from people who haven’t, the study’s assumptions might not hold. Researchers do their best to adjust for this, but any adjustment will be imperfect. In addition, getting the vaccine could change behavior — the vaccinated might take more risks, and they might be less likely to seek Covid-19 testing or be required to provide negative test results.

So this estimate shouldn’t be considered definitive. But it lines up with other sources of evidence, and it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is likely highly effective — in the 80 to 90 percent range — at preventing infections. And low infection rates mean low transmission rates.

Viral load and reduced odds of transmission

But let’s say a person who has been vaccinated still gets infected with Covid-19. That’s not great, but the vaccine likely continues to protect the people around them, according to the research so far. That’s because of another consideration: viral load — that is, how much virus can be measured in a patient’s nose and throat.

Not everyone who has Covid-19 is equally likely to transmit it. A study recently published in The Lancet based on research from contact tracing in Spain has found a very strong association between viral load and how many other people the patient infects, as well as how serious the infections in other people are.

This isn’t very surprising. Viral load determines how much virus you are coughing or breathing into the air, which determines whether other people get sick. And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

Don’t go bar-hopping, but having also-vaccinated friends over is likely fine, Dr. Leana Wen of the George Washington School of Public Health argues in the Washington Post. Letting your grandparents hold your kids? Families might reasonably conclude that’s also fine, she says.

Vaccinated people should, of course, respect businesses’ rules about masks — the essential workers asked to enforce those rules have no way to know if you’ve been vaccinated. And while most people are still unvaccinated, the vaccinated should be thoughtful about protecting those who haven’t had a chance at the vaccines yet. But those reminders shouldn’t drown out an accurate understanding of the fact that the vaccines are really effective.

“Advising people that they must do nothing differently after vaccination — not even in the privacy of their homes — creates the misimpression that vaccines offer little benefit at all. Vaccines provide a true reduction of risk, not a false sense of security,” epidemiologist Julia Marcus argued in the Atlantic.

Our recommendations for vaccinated people should reflect our best current understanding of the evidence.

It’s true that there’s still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of the vaccines on transmission. It’s possible that as we learn more from Israel, recommendations will change. And it’s important that people get fully vaccinated — two shots, plus some time for the immunity to fully take hold — before they assume the vaccine has fully protected them and the people around them.

But what’s important to remember is that we aren’t operating from complete ignorance. We know a lot about the vaccines, and what we know points toward them being very effective at reducing transmission and protecting those around us. If you’re hesitant about taking the vaccine because you heard that it might not protect others, you shouldn’t be, because the evidence suggests it does. That message is at least as important as warnings for the vaccinated not to “party.”

Correction, February 24: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who have received the Covid-19 vaccine. Sixty-four million doses had been administered as of the 24th, but since the vaccines approved so far are administered in two doses, 44 million people had received at least one dose by that date.",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'explained', 'vaccinated', 'pfizerbiontech', 'growing', 'study', 'transmission', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'viral', 'reduce', 'data', 'evidence', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-23 18:40:14+00:00,21,"More than 50 million Americans have now gotten their first shot against Covid-19, and 25 million have gotten two shots. There’s strong evidence that the two Covid-19 vaccines Americans are getting — one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other by Moderna — are highly effective at preventing illness, hospitalization, and death.

Despite that fact, public health officials and media outlets have been warning that vaccinated people need to behave largely how they did before they were vaccinated. That’s because we don’t know as much about the vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing transmission to others. A vaccinated person may be well-protected from Covid-19, but if they carry the virus, could they possibly infect the people around them?

But a growing body of evidence suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines do, in fact, cut down on viral transmission. Two recent studies show some pretty favorable results — one from the UK that found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut down by 86 percent someone’s chances of developing an infection that they could pass along, the other a study in Israel that found an 89.4 percent reduction (though it should be noted that the Israeli study has yet to be fully released). These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

In other words, even as we wait for more definitive studies on the vaccines’ effects on transmission, more and more scientists think we do have enough information to feel pretty good about the vaccines’ capacity to give us back a semblance of normalcy as we approach a year of life in a pandemic.

In an opinion piece, Johns Hopkins epidemiologists M. Kate Grabowski and Justin Lessler argued, “We are confident vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the chances of transmitting the virus.”

“I have been very cautious due to limited evidence on transmission effects but agree with [Grabowski and Lessler] that a large transmission effect is the best explanation of the limited evidence to date,” Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said in February.

In a new preprint, he and Harvard epidemiologist Rebecca Kahn laid out some principles for how to evaluate data from observational studies like the UK and Israel ones. Applying their principles to Moderna data (more on this below), they estimate that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.”

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has sounded an optimistic note. “The looming question is, if the person who’s been vaccinated gets infected, does that person have the capability to transmit it to another person? Some studies are pointing in a very favorable direction,” he said in a White House briefing in mid-February.

Studying exactly how much a vaccine affects transmission is very difficult. It requires exceptionally good contact tracing, which few countries have, or inference from lots of different forms of limited evidence. Uncertainty remains about exactly how much the vaccines reduce transmission — and that uncertainty has led many public health officials to be cautious in their public statements.

But that cautiousness can end up misleading the public, giving people the impression that scientists have no information at all. That, in turn, could also lead to vaccine hesitancy. Some people may think, if I get vaccinated but I still have to continue masking and social distancing at all times, then why get vaccinated at all?

“In their own lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend to be cleareyed about the vaccines. Many are getting shots as soon as they’re offered one. They are urging their family and friends to do the same,” David Leonhardt argues in a New York Times piece. “But when they speak to a national audience, they deliver a message that comes off very differently. It is dominated by talk of risks, uncertainties, caveats and possible problems. It feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation and anxiety.”

The vaccines do reduce transmission. They do take us a big step closer toward life beyond the pandemic. And the messaging from our institutions should start reflecting that.

The two new studies looking at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, explained

Now that many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 — about 50 million in the US — new research is coming out every day that clarifies the transmission picture. Two key new studies look at the rate of disease among people who got two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. That’s an important figure for judging how effective vaccines are for transmission — the lower the rate of infection, the lower the rate of transmission.

A little step back here to explain where things stand on vaccines: There are several vaccines approved in different parts of the world, with various approaches and levels of effectiveness. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were the first to be approved for use in the US, and there’s more data available about them, and to keep the scope of this piece manageable, it will focus on just those two vaccines.

A working paper recently published with The Lancet’s preprint publication program looked at health care workers in the United Kingdom who were vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It finds that the vaccine doesn’t just make people less likely to get symptomatic infections (which we already knew from Pfizer/BioNTech’s initial trials) — it also makes them much much less likely to get infected at all. “Vaccine effectiveness was 72% ... 21 days after first dose and 86% ... 7 days after the second dose,” the study concludes.

That’s lower than the 95 percent headline number you might have seen, but that 95 percent measures symptomatic infections; this measures all infections, even “invisible” asymptomatic ones, through routine testing of healthy people.

Another recent paper, this time out of Israel, looked at the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well. (A big caveat: The findings were announced in a press release, but the study itself hasn’t been released yet.) It found a drop of 89.4 percent in infections among people who got two doses of the vaccine, compared to unvaccinated people. We don’t have as much information from this research as we’d like yet, as the paper has yet to be made public, and given the methodological challenges of estimating transmission, the details of the paper matter a lot. But that number is similar to the one from the UK study.

Even though the studies focused only on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there’s reason to believe that the results translate to the Moderna vaccine as well. The two vaccines work very similarly. Both contain a set of instructions to the RNA in our cells to build a protein very similar to the “spike protein” in the coronavirus. Then the immune system notices the intruder and responds, producing antibodies that’ll protect against the coronavirus later.

Because the two vaccines work very similarly, the researchers I spoke to said it was overwhelmingly likely that they both block transmission to a similar degree. As a result, we can assume — though with some uncertainty — that evidence of strong infection reductions from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also likely applies to Moderna.

But even before the most recent research came out, we already knew that the vaccines would help curb transmission. For one thing, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines reduce the chances of getting a symptomatic case of Covid-19 by 94 percent and 95 percent, respectively. That is a promising starting point — if a person doesn’t get Covid-19, then they can’t pass it on.

But what about asymptomatic cases?

In their initial clinical trials, Moderna and Pfizer didn’t study whether vaccinated people got asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 — that is, people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not suffer any symptoms. However, when people went in for their second shot, Moderna did give them a nasal swab test for Covid-19. In a supplement to its submission to the FDA, Moderna says that 14 of the 14,134 vaccinated people had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time) and 38 of the 14,073 people in the control group had Covid-19 (with no symptoms at the time).

That rules out one big worry about the vaccines: that they might make Covid-19 mild in vaccinated people — so mild they don’t experience any symptoms — without actually preventing it. Instead, it was clear from back in December that the vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection as well as reducing symptomatic infection.

Using Moderna’s nasal swab test data, infectious disease biologist Marm Kilpatrick at UCSC estimated that the vaccine, after a single shot, reduces a person’s odds of infection with Covid-19 by up to 90 percent. (When I emailed him, we determined that with some more pessimistic assumptions, the reduction might be more like 78 to 88 percent.)

Lipsitch and Kahn took a different approach, and estimated from the same data that “one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more.” Of course, the overall efficacy of the vaccine after both doses will almost certainly be higher.

The recent data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel and in the UK backs up that idea. It suggests that after two shots, the vaccine is 85 to 90 percent effective at preventing infection with Covid-19.

There are some caveats. The data from the UK and from Israel comes from observational studies, not randomized controlled trials: If the people who’d been vaccinated differ from people who haven’t, the study’s assumptions might not hold. Researchers do their best to adjust for this, but any adjustment will be imperfect. In addition, getting the vaccine could change behavior — the vaccinated might take more risks, and they might be less likely to seek Covid-19 testing or be required to provide negative test results.

So this estimate shouldn’t be considered definitive. But it lines up with other sources of evidence, and it suggests that, overall, the vaccine is likely highly effective — in the 80 to 90 percent range — at preventing infections. And low infection rates mean low transmission rates.

Viral load and reduced odds of transmission

But let’s say a person who has been vaccinated still gets infected with Covid-19. That’s not great, but the vaccine likely continues to protect the people around them, according to the research so far. That’s because of another consideration: viral load — that is, how much virus can be measured in a patient’s nose and throat.

Not everyone who has Covid-19 is equally likely to transmit it. A study recently published in The Lancet based on research from contact tracing in Spain has found a very strong association between viral load and how many other people the patient infects, as well as how serious the infections in other people are.

This isn’t very surprising. Viral load determines how much virus you are coughing or breathing into the air, which determines whether other people get sick. And if they get sick with an unusually large dose of the virus, it’ll have a “head start” at infecting them, and they’re likely to get sicker.

“In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline,” the study concludes.

The impact of the vaccine on transmission, then, will be the product of two factors, co-author Michael Marks, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me: lower chance of getting infected, and lower viral load if infected.

We already covered the former point above; what about the latter? Do the vaccines cut viral load?

On this front, there’s great news in another preprint based on data from Israel: The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine appears to cut viral load dramatically, so people who do get Covid-19 after the vaccine have less of the virus in their nose and throat, making them less likely to infect other people.

“We find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,” the study concludes. This research is just a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, but if the data holds up, it would suggest that vaccinated people who test positive and are infectious are still significantly less infectious than unvaccinated people.

“The data is certainly intriguing and suggestive that vaccination may reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases, even if it does not prevent infection altogether,” Virginia Pitzer, an infectious diseases modeler at the Yale School of Public Health, told Nature.

Many of the caveats discussed above apply to this study, too. This research from Israel is an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. However, the vaccinated people had the same average viral load during the first 12 days after vaccination as the unvaccinated people, and only after 12 days did a difference start to emerge, which suggests the vaccine is what is producing the difference.

In total, vaccination unambiguously makes people less likely to get a case of Covid-19. Then, if a vaccinated person does get a Covid-19 case, preliminary Pfizer data from Israel suggests they’ll have lower viral loads, which other research has established makes them less likely to pass on the virus. And because of the lower viral load, if they do infect another person, the infection is less likely to be serious.

To be clear, the transmission point is based on early data — there’s still uncertainty about how exactly lower viral loads in vaccinated people will translate to lower infectiousness. But “some data” is different from “no data.”

How we should and shouldn’t talk about uncertainty

There isn’t significant doubt among epidemiologists that vaccines somewhat cut transmission.

First, almost all vaccines do that, so it was a good starting assumption before we had any data at all. (There are a few exceptions, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, but they’re very rare.)

Second, it’s where all the data on the Covid-19 vaccines points. “Everyone thinks the data indicate a reduction in total infections, as well as symptomatic infections,” Kilpatrick told me. “People disagree on whether we can accurately estimate how [large is] the reduction in total infections and infectiousness.”

In other words: There seems to be consensus that the vaccines don’t just keep the vaccinated safe — they make the people around them safer, too. The real question is how much safer. Lipsitch, who is more conservative than Kilpatrick at estimating that impact, still says that no effect on transmission would be “beyond shocking,”.

But the fact that the vaccines make other people safer too hasn’t necessarily made it into public messaging. News reports of the vaccine have foregrounded what the vaccine can’t guarantee and what we can’t do after we’ve been vaccinated.

“Yes, people with coronavirus vaccinations should still distance from each other. Here’s why,” argued the Washington Post.

“You’re fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — now what? Don’t expect to shed your mask and get back to normal activities right away,” begins an Associated Press story in which older people who have all been fully vaccinated are advised not to reunite with each other.

“Our discussion about vaccines has been poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist, told the New York Times. It has overwhelmingly emphasized the fact that post-vaccine transmission is still possible, rather than frankly discussing the probability of such transmission and leaving it up to people to make their own risk calculation.

That’s because a lot of public health officials worry about encouraging people who’ve been vaccinated to “party like it’s 1999,” potentially spreading the virus to other people who haven’t had their chance to get vaccinated yet.

It’s important to note that for a vaccinated person’s behavior to be more dangerous than an unvaccinated person’s, they’d have to go really wild. If vaccines reduce infection by 90 percent, then unless your behavior gets 10 times more dangerous after you’re vaccinated, you are still safer to be around than you were before the vaccine.

2021-02-23 14:20:56+00:00,5,"Editor’s note, January 10, 2022: This article was originally published in February 2021, and public health guidance around masking to prevent Covid-19 transmission may have shifted. For Vox’s latest coverage on the pandemic, see here.

My favorite face mask is a sleek black cloth number — it goes with everything, it doesn’t chafe my face, and it’s sold in a relatively affordable three-pack, so I always have a backup. I have a whole collection of cloth masks, like you probably do, cobbled together at random, in bright colors and patterns, generally homemade by an assortment of people in my life.

Yet, as we’ve slipped into allowing our face coverings to project our tastes while they protect us, there’s another element of style that’s often forgotten: fit. And fit is incredibly important when it comes to how effective our masks are.

Tons of celebrities have been seen out with their masks underneath their noses. Notably, members of Congress who promote masking up have been seen pulling up their sliding masks in public.

Cloth masks sometimes lend themselves to poor etiquette: Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) slipped his down to sneeze into his hand on C-SPAN, which is, to put it plainly, horrifying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is known to have masks that match her outfits but was once photographed in a conversation with George Floyd’s brother, mask hanging down below her mouth. And soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden’s mask slipped down his face in the midst of signing an executive action related to Covid-19. It happens to the best of us. Walk around anywhere in pandemic America, and you’ll surely encounter people fiddling with their masks.

But in order to truly protect you, cloth masks need to have a snug fit. And wearing a well-fitted mask might be more important than it’s ever been in the pandemic. As previously reported by Julia Belluz for Vox, a more contagious new variant of Covid-19, known as B.1.1.7, that’s now spreading around the world, should make us even more cautious about our risk of exposure to the virus, especially in indoor spaces.

Mask fit really matters

Proper mask-wearing remains a key factor in preventing the transmission of the coronavirus. A mask slip can leave the wearer extremely vulnerable, as the nasal passage is a common entryway for the virus to get into the body. According to a study in Nature Medicine, the virus attaches to certain proteins found in the nasal passage. There are actually more of these proteins in the nose than in the lungs, making an exposed nose a serious threat. You don’t want any viral particles getting to your nose, so it’s imperative that your mask has a tight fit.

Cloth masks are still fine for the general public to use, experts tell me, so don’t feel like you have to run out and buy a medical-grade mask like an N95. We think about what our masks look like every day, but we are largely ignoring the importance of the proper fit. There’s not enough emphasis on what makes a mask well-fitted and effective — we’ve gotten distracted with design, when really we need to be worrying about how comfortable our masks are and whether or not they are secure enough to rely on.

The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force, a research group based out of Cambridge University, investigates the efficacy and improvement of civilian face masks and fabrics. “What we found through our research is that the actual filtration material is not as important as fit. In order to get any benefit from a high filtration material, you have to have fit,” Eugenia O’Kelly, a PhD student who heads the group, said. O’Kelly emphasized that without highly specialized machinery, there is no way to be 100 percent sure your mask fits, but did have tips for improved fit and protection.

According to her team’s tests, double masking can be helpful. “Keep in mind, you do not end up numerically doubling your protection by layering masks. I have seen a lot of this type of ‘math’ online, but unfortunately, this is not how depth filtration works,” she said. But doubling up can ensure you get a better seal around the nose and mouth than one mask alone that might be a bit too loose. According to the new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released February 10, well-fitted surgical masks or a “cloth and surgical mask combination” can reduced virus transmission by up to 96.5 percent. The director of the CDC has also urged Americans to wear a mask with “two or more layers,” the New York Times reports.

O’Kelly says there are two methods scientists use to find out if a mask fits. “You can have quantitative fitting and qualitative fitting. In quantitative fitting, you are measuring the amount of particles inside and outside of the mask,” she said. Most surgical masks don’t fit tightly enough, or are made of material without sufficient filtration, so they won’t pass.

Quantitative fitting can be expensive because it requires specialized hospital equipment. “More common is qualitative mask fitting,” she said, for which her team is experimenting with using aroma diffusers as a test. If you are wearing a mask and can taste the particles through it, it’s a sign that your mask is ill-fitting.

In order to identify if your mask is good at protecting others, O’Kelly recommends avoiding masks with the following characteristics:

Thin material: If you can see any gaps between the fibers when you hold it to the light, that is a sign that viruses can get through. Single-layer: If your mask only has one (or even two) layers of fabric, the filtration is probably not high. The best masks have multiple layers or have a pocket to insert a filter, such as a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter. Poor fit: Fit is very important in a mask’s success, as you can read about in this recent study. You may not be able to get a mask that fits you perfectly, but the more and larger the gaps you see, the poorer the fit is. This may be more important when protecting the wearer than others. Discomfort: If the mask is very uncomfortable, you may be less likely to wear it correctly, and more likely to touch the outside of the mask or adjust it while out and about.

So how should a mask fit? “The mask should be a good fit over the nose and mouth, but not overly tight to impair breathing. It is not intended to filter out all the air one breathes, but intended to hold back droplets from our mouth from spreading in the air,” George Abraham, the chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine’s Infectious Disease Board, tells me.

There’s not a lot we can do to prevent a mask from falling down — except maybe try to find a mask that fits better.

O’Kelly also recommends doing a fit check, although there is no reliable way to currently assess the fit of fabric masks. “Move your hand around the edges of the mask where it makes contact with your skin and see if you can feel any air. If you feel the air, there is a gap,” she said. But just because a mask has a gap does not mean it’s totally ineffective. It just means it’s not providing the maximum level of protection possible. According to O’Kelly, a fabric mask with fit issues can protect the user from over 50 percent of particles, and well-constructed fabric masks with gaps still can filter over 75 percent of particles.

In a Consumer Reports article, William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, recommends tightening your mask if it slips off your nose. You can adjust the strings and make sure there isn’t any space for air on the sides. Our best bet is selecting a mask that fits properly: snug around the nose and mouth without gaps at the sides. A wire nose bridge can help your mask mold to your face. The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force’s studies have found that a metal nose band can improve fit. However, in less structured or elastic masks, that nose band can also harm performance, so the user has to make a judgment call.

But shouldn’t we just get N95s?

As comforting as it might be that experts say cloth masks are sufficient, the United States is far behind countries like Austria, where the government provides FFP2 masks to citizens, and Taiwan, where the government has been providing citizens with high-quality masks that are probably going to fit better than some of the cloth masks in circulation. Why can’t the same happen here in the United States?

The argument for the government to supply masks is not new. It might do Americans well to have better PPE, but there are a lot of caveats that come with the use of heavy-duty masks like the N95. In an email, Abraham told me that it would be difficult for the government to make sure that everyone had an effective N95. “The wearer needs to be ‘fit-tested’ so that the mask being used is not leaking but forms a good seal on the face, or else the ability of the mask to filter is lost,” he wrote. “As a practical reality, that is not consistently possible with the general public.”

There are ways to test the N95 — “you could place both hands around the rim of the mask, once on the face, and blow hard into it. If you feel air on your hands, you know the mask is not a tight fit,” Abraham explains. But according to experts, it is also not 100 percent accurate.

The N95 masks are a must for health care workers because they’re great for long exposure situations, but they might be excessive for short-term use, according to Abraham. An N95 mask might be more appropriate for a long plane ride, for example, instead of a quick run to the grocery store. “The use of the mask would be inconsistent, without doing a fit check every time,” Abraham said, and it would be “cost-prohibitive and accomplish little.” The government couldn’t regulate the N95 use of every civilian, and the respirators would be rendered useless if not properly fitting.

While the research O’Kelly’s group has done on mask materials is still being peer-reviewed, she says that even a mask with poor fit is better than not wearing one at all. “If you can see a gap at all, your mask is probably not functioning at 100 percent. However, that certainly does not mean the mask is useless if there are gaps.” Any kind of gap can compromise the effectiveness of a mask, so it is important to try to make sure there are no spaces if possible.

So next time you find yourself tugging at your face mask all day, consider finding another style or model that may work better. For extra protection, spend a little more money to get a mask with a pocket to add a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter, and shop around to get multiple masks that you can fit check at home. Mask slipping plagues us, but if we work at it, we can ward off the actual plague. It might take some trial and error, but this is worth getting right.",voxdotcom,"['nose', 'fits', 'important', 'masks', 'mask', 'fit', 'filter', 'better', 'face', 'air', 'cloth', 'vs', 'n95', 'answer']",0
2021-02-23 12:56:17+00:00,29,"When the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, it may have seemed like a distant threat. But very quickly, the tiny pathogen made its way around the world, bringing sickness and death wherever it went. In America, the first known Covid-19 fatality occurred on February 6, 2020. From there, the wave of daily deaths started rising. By the end of May 2020, the virus had taken 100,000 lives, mostly in the Northeast and major cities. Four months later, the death toll surpassed 200,000. Less than three months later, by mid-December, more than 300,000 people had died. With the virus spreading all over the US, it took only 36 more days to reach 400,000 deaths. January was the deadliest month so far.

Who has died from Covid-19 in the US? The virus was unsparing.

Across the country, more than 28 million people have contracted the coronavirus, and over 500,000 have died. That’s the highest Covid-19 toll of any country and more than the coronavirus deaths in Italy, Germany, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, and France combined. It exceeds the US death toll in World War II. It’s also an underestimate, and doesn’t account for all the people impacted by loss. If every American who died has left nine people grieving, as one study suggested, there are now more than 4 million Americans who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. Death at this scale is difficult to comprehend, or visualize. To get a clearer sense of the shifting burden of Covid-19 deaths over time, Vox analyzed coronavirus mortality by age, region, and race from the past year, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. We found that while Covid-19 spared no group, it impacted certain populations more than others. Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus. They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black. But what started as a health emergency concentrated in travelers, urban minority communities, and other crowded places (such as nursing homes and prisons) fanned out into rural areas of the country, leading to a surge in deaths among white people, too. In the deaths, we saw how an “infectious disease became a universal issue,” said Boston University School of Public Health dean Sandro Galea. The extraordinary loss of life was also preventable, said Virginia Commonwealth University’s Steven Woolf, and a grim marker of “how poorly the US handled the pandemic.” By the winter of 2020, the virus was spreading broadly in every state, and largely by people younger than 50. Still, disparities in lives lost have persisted.

A trend at the start of the US outbreak has held: People of color have died of Covid-19 at much higher rates — double the rate of white people overall in 2020. But over the course of the year, the share of Covid-19 deaths among white people grew, while the share among Black and Hispanic people decreased.

In absolute terms, the death rate among white people rose significantly, while the rate among people of color dropped slightly. This was a trend we found in communities across America as Covid-19 spread. Deaths shifted from diverse counties to those with a higher share of white people

Experts attribute the change to the evolving geography of the virus — a result of the failure by states and the federal government to curtail transmission. At the start of the US outbreak, coronavirus cases — and deaths — were concentrated in a few cities, which have large numbers of people of color who are more likely to do essential work. “The impact of Covid-19 was limited to New York, and to a lesser extent Detroit and New Orleans,” said Dartmouth health economist Jonathan Skinner, “and in particular among people who had to commute by public transportation to service-sector jobs.” Many Black and Hispanic people soon contracted the virus and died at very high rates — an estimated 118,000 in 2020 overall. By October, some of the most sparsely populated areas of the country — Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska — were grappling with America’s worst outbreaks. The relative share of deaths among white people started rising. “The politics of 2020 led governors in [these] parts of the country to be less aggressive in dealing with the virus or actively discourage public health safeguards,” Woolf said. At the same time, more states adopted face-mask orders and other safety measures. Mask mandates helped bring case numbers down, and may have saved the lives of some essential workers. The result: In August, Black people died at 2.5 times the rate of white people. By November, the rate was 2.2. In early February, it was 1.5. But minorities were disproportionately affected by the virus in every month of 2020. They were also much more likely to die young.

Of people over age 85 who died of Covid-19, 80 percent were white. Of those who died between the ages of 35 and 44, only 20 percent were white.

The data also reveals that regardless of race or geography, there is one group that has consistently experienced an extraordinarily high risk of death: the elderly. Age remains the greatest predictor overall of who lives after infection with the coronavirus and who dies.

Nearly half of all 2020 Covid-19 deaths were of people age 80 or older. If you include people age 60 or older, the share of deaths reaches almost 90 percent. With confirmed cases, the picture looks very different: Younger people, ages 20 to 59, are somewhat overrepresented.

In March through May, people age 80 and older had the most confirmed cases per capita (although testing for much of this time was limited). By June, that burden shifted to younger people. The summer case surge in young people was followed by a winter uptick in elderly deaths

2021-02-23 11:01:24+00:00,30,"We’ve reached half a million deaths from the coronavirus in the US. But most of these deaths — and the grueling medical ordeals leading up to them — have remained largely hidden from view. The majority of terminally ill Covid-19 patients typically spend their last days or weeks isolated in ICUs to keep the virus from spreading.

“Most of what I’m seeing is behind closed curtains, and the general public isn’t seeing this side of it,” says Todd Rice, a critical care and pulmonology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Even “families are only seeing a little bit of it,” he says. As a result, most of us have been “protected and sheltered from seeing the worst of this disease.”

So what have these 500,000 people endured as the infection took over and their bodies failed? The terrible details have been strikingly absent from most of our personal and national discussions about the virus. But if we have been thus far (perhaps somewhat willfully) blind to the excruciating ways Covid-19 takes lives, this milestone is an opportunity to open our eyes.

Four physicians, who collectively have cared for more than 100 dying Covid-19 patients over the past 11 months, shared with Vox what their patients have gone through physically and mentally as the virus killed them. Their experiences reveal the isolating and invasive realities of what it is typically like for someone to die from Covid-19.

Lungs “full of bees” and a “sense of impending doom”

The torture of Covid-19 can begin long before someone is sick enough to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.

Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, it hampers the intake of oxygen. People with worsening Covid-19 typically show up in the emergency room because they are having trouble breathing.

As their lungs deteriorate further, they have a harder and harder time getting enough oxygen with each breath, meaning they need to breathe faster and faster — up from an average of about 14 times per minute to 30 or 40. Such gasping can bring about a very real sense of panic.

Imagine trying to breathe through a very narrow straw, says Jess Mandel, chief of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine at UC San Diego Health. “You can do that for 15 to 20 seconds, but try doing it for two hours.” Or for days or weeks.

Patients struggling through low oxygen levels like this have told Kenneth Remy, an assistant professor of critical care medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, that it feels like a band across their chest or that their lungs are on fire. Or like a thousand bees stinging them inside their chest. Others might have thick secretions in their lungs that make it feel like they are trying to breathe through muck. Many people say it feels like they’re being smothered.

The ordeal is so taxing that many wish for death. “You hear the patients say, ‘I just want to die because this is so excruciating,’” Remy says. “That’s what this virus does.”

“I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy”

Others feel that death is coming no matter what they do. Rice notes that is much more so for his Covid-19 patients than others he has treated. There seems to be something about Covid-19, he says, “that makes people prone to having a feeling of, ‘I really believe I’m going to die.’”

Meilinh Thi, who specializes in critical care and pulmonology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, has witnessed the same thing. “A lot of patients, regardless of age, have this sense of impending doom,” Thi says. Many have told her outright they felt like they were going to die. Eerily, “Everyone who has told me that has passed away,” she says.

Isolated

The agony of being critically ill with Covid-19 isn’t just borne by the body but also by the mind. “It doesn’t only put your lungs on fire or give you a horrible headache or make you feel miserable or make you breathe really fast,” Remy says. “It also wreaks havoc on your mental state.”

For one, from the time anyone with Covid-19 is admitted to the hospital, they are essentially cut off from almost everything that is familiar. Most Covid-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that some are also dying in long-term care facilities (about 10 percent) or at home (about 6 percent).

“A lot of patients have told me how isolating and how lonely it is,” Thi says. And many get depressed. It is also incredibly scary to reach that point of illness with a disease that we know has already killed so many people, she and others point out.

All of these challenges have a cumulative effect. “If you can understand being in the hospital for two, three weeks, continuously breathing that fast, not having good interactions with your family because they can’t come and visit you — it’s extremely anxiety-provoking. It’s scary,” Remy says.

Being in the ICU for any reason also vastly increases a person’s risk for delirium, a state of confusion that can result in agitation, fear, and anger. Medications used to sedate people or relieve pain (both common in Covid-19 treatment) are part of the reason for this risk, as are the constant monitoring and physical disturbances — and subsequent sleep disruption.

Being a Covid-19 patient increases this likelihood of disorientation even more. Some estimates put the rate of delirium among adult ICU Covid-19 patients at about 65 percent.

One reason for this extra risk is that the only people patients see are covered in head-to-toe PPE, often with only their eye area visible behind a shield or goggles, rendering them even more anonymous and unfamiliar. (ICU nurses have described working alongside the same people for decades and now not recognizing them due to all the protective gear.) “That for sure increases the risk of delirium,” Thi says.

As a Covid-19 patient, “You’re just devoid of human contact to a large degree,” Mandel says.

And that is no small thing. With loved ones relegated to video calls, personal connection through in-person visits — typically a mainstay during an intensive hospital stay — is gone.

“If your mom or dad or spouse was in the hospital and was very sick, you would be at their bedside holding their hand,” Remy says. With fatal Covid-19, your last meaningful contact with family, before your final hours, might be as you get admitted into the ER, days or weeks before.

Doctors often have to use many invasive procedures to try to save lives

Anyone unwell enough to be in the ICU for any reason will be hooked up to lots of machines. But people with severe Covid-19 face a particularly grueling and invasive experience.

When people can no longer breathe for themselves and still aren’t getting enough oxygen from external sources (like short nose tubes or a BiPap machine, like those some people wear for sleep apnea), the next step is usually putting them on a ventilator.

To do this, patients are put on IV-based sedation and pain medication so they can tolerate the procedure. A tube is inserted into the mouth and down the airway so the machine can pump air into the lungs. The tube can remain there for days or weeks, during which time that person will remain heavily sedated and unable to talk. (This sedation can also mask other problems that arise during their illness, such as major strokes.)

“The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around”

Those who have survived the ordeal often don’t even remember the day leading up to being put on ventilation, Thi says. “They say they really just lost that portion of their life.”

The ventilator itself is not without risks. For example, if the machine is set to deliver too much air, it can cause additional lung damage. And the breathing tube only tends to be safe to keep in place for about two to three weeks, Thi notes. After that, it can start to deteriorate. At that point, doctors might surgically insert a tube into the patient’s neck — a procedure known as a tracheostomy — to connect them to the ventilator.

For some, even mechanical ventilation can’t get them enough oxygen. These patients often get put on “heart-lung” machines, which pump blood out of the body, through a machine that oxygenates it, and back in. (These are also sometimes used for people who have suffered a heart attack, and are known to have numerous side effects, such as increased risk for strokes as well as for agitation and delirium.) This process requires two large catheters (long tubes) inserted into a major artery or vein, so the machine can effectively pump enough blood in and out of the body.

Flipping people onto their stomachs has also helped get more air into their systems. During this practice, called proning, the sick individual is typically put on a medication to paralyze them so they cannot move. (Medical staff also turn incapacitated patients in bed every couple of hours “to make sure their skin doesn’t break down,” Thi says.)

A significant proportion of people — somewhere between about 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 — who get very sick with Covid-19 also end up with kidney failure. To prevent this from killing them, they’re put on dialysis machines, which take blood out of the body and filter it before returning it to the body. This procedure can cause nausea, cramping, and chronic itching. Anyone getting dialysis will need two additional large catheters put into another major blood vessel.

But these aren’t all of the tubes critically ill Covid-19 patients need. ﻿They also have a central venous catheter to administer medication. This long tube usually gets inserted into a major vein in the clavicle or groin, then is pushed through the vein until it reaches the heart, where it will stay until that person recovers or dies. Another catheter, sometimes put in near the groin, will take the person’s blood for analysis.

Other catheters will be inserted into the urethra to drain urine (which is monitored closely) and the rectum to frequently evacuate their feces (which is especially important because Covid-19 often causes diarrhea). Additional IVs, such as for hydration and medications, will poke patients in smaller vessels as well. People this ill with Covid-19 will also have a tube put into their mouth or nose and down into their stomach, to deliver a nutritious slurry to prevent malnutrition.

On top of all of these tubes and needles, a number of other beeping and humming devices monitor a person’s vitals. Leads attached to the chest track heart function, and a pulse oximeter on the finger keeps tabs on oxygen saturation. A standard cuff monitors blood pressure, but people often get an additional catheter into yet another vessel to measure blood pressure from within that artery.

All of these incredibly invasive interventions have a goal of sustaining the body simply so that it can try to fight off the virus and heal. “The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around,” Mandel says. “It’s always a race.”

But even all of these procedures — alongside treatments like dexamethasone and remdesivir — are not enough to save everyone with Covid-19. Some people decline to go through some or all of this, or at least to endure it indefinitely, but that does not guarantee a lack of suffering. And for those most unlucky 1.8 percent of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in the US, death will then be imminent.

The end

Once someone is sick enough with Covid-19 that they need a ventilator, their chance of survival is somewhere between 40 and 60 percent, notes Remy. “You flip a coin, and you may be one of those people who die,” he says.

Remy recalls one particularly difficult week during the fall surge when he cared for a number of people in their 40s and 50s who ultimately died. Most of them were obese but otherwise healthy when they caught Covid-19 by not wearing a mask.

“One of the[se] patients specifically told me before I put the breathing tube in, ‘Let everyone know that this is real, my lungs are on fire. It’s like there’s bees stinging me. I can’t breathe. Please let them know to wear a mask ... because I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.’”

Right after that patient died, Remy made a precautionary video that he posted on Twitter.

Please listen as this is dire. I don’t want to be the last person that looks in your frightened eyes. #MaskUp ⁦@DrKenRemy1⁩ ⁦@WUSTLmed⁩ pic.twitter.com/qwb4eERlfE — Kenneth E. Remy, MD, MHSc, FCCM (@DrKenRemy1) November 21, 2020

If a patient’s breathing deteriorates slowly, hospitals can often arrange a way for them to talk with family members before they get intubated. Because after the tube goes in, they might not be conscious or able to talk again before they die. Regardless, the last person they have conscious contact with is typically a member of the medical staff before they are heavily sedated to receive the ventilator tube. In essence, “It could be anybody,” Rice says.

Despite the strict isolation for Covid-19 patients, “We try to make sure patients don’t die alone,” Thi says. For those who quickly nosedive, there often isn’t time to bring in family. Those people die surrounded by medical staff, either receiving CPR or, if they had do not resuscitate orders, with staff standing by.

For those who fall toward death, family — in full PPE — are now typically allowed in (which wasn’t usually the case at the beginning of the pandemic). At that point, “We would proceed with comfort measures only,” Thi says. In this scenario, the dying person will be on heavy medication as the ventilator tube is removed. Even still, once it gets taken out, people often gasp or cough as the body fights for air before they die.

Despite the palliative care and the possibility for family to now be present for a person’s actual death, doctors describe Covid-19 as a uniquely terrible way to die. “Covid is just so different,” Thi says. “I don’t think anything could be comparable to it. ... I don’t wish it on my worst enemy.”

Remy agrees. After having cared for patients dying from infectious diseases all over the world, he says, “I don’t know a disease that wreaks such havoc on the body and on the mind.” Which is perhaps why his dying patient was pleading with him so desperately just before being intubated to tell people to wear their masks and take the virus seriously.

Because otherwise, it will continue to take thousands of lives this way each day in the US until we can get vaccines to almost everyone.

Leads attached to the chest track heart function, and a pulse oximeter on the finger keeps tabs on oxygen saturation. A standard cuff monitors blood pressure, but people often get an additional catheter into yet another vessel to measure blood pressure from within that artery.

All of these incredibly invasive interventions have a goal of sustaining the body simply so that it can try to fight off the virus and heal. “The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around,” Mandel says. “It’s always a race.”

But even all of these procedures — alongside treatments like dexamethasone and remdesivir — are not enough to save everyone with Covid-19. Some people decline to go through some or all of this, or at least to endure it indefinitely, but that does not guarantee a lack of suffering. And for those most unlucky 1.8 percent of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in the US, death will then be imminent.

The end

Once someone is sick enough with Covid-19 that they need a ventilator, their chance of survival is somewhere between 40 and 60 percent, notes Remy. “You flip a coin, and you may be one of those people who die,” he says.

Remy recalls one particularly difficult week during the fall surge when he cared for a number of people in their 40s and 50s who ultimately died. Most of them were obese but otherwise healthy when they caught Covid-19 by not wearing a mask.

“One of the[se] patients specifically told me before I put the breathing tube in, ‘Let everyone know that this is real, my lungs are on fire. It’s like there’s bees stinging me. I can’t breathe. Please let them know to wear a mask ... because I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.’”

Right after that patient died, Remy made a precautionary video that he posted on Twitter.

If a patient’s breathing deteriorates slowly, hospitals can often arrange a way for them to talk with family members before they get intubated. Because after the tube goes in, they might not be conscious or able to talk again before they die. Regardless, the last person they have conscious contact with is typically a member of the medical staff before they are heavily sedated to receive the ventilator tube. In essence, “It could be anybody,” Rice says.

Despite the strict isolation for Covid-19 patients, “We try to make sure patients don’t die alone,” Thi says. For those who quickly nosedive, there often isn’t time to bring in family. Those people die surrounded by medical staff, either receiving CPR or, if they had do not resuscitate orders, with staff standing by.

For those who fall toward death, family — in full PPE — are now typically allowed in (which wasn’t usually the case at the beginning of the pandemic). At that point, “We would proceed with comfort measures only,” Thi says. In this scenario, the dying person will be on heavy medication as the ventilator tube is removed. Even still, once it gets taken out, people often gasp or cough as the body fights for air before they die.

Despite the palliative care and the possibility for family to now be present for a person’s actual death, doctors describe Covid-19 as a uniquely terrible way to die. “Covid is just so different,” Thi says. “I don’t think anything could be comparable to it. ... I don’t wish it on my worst enemy.”

Remy agrees. After having cared for patients dying from infectious diseases all over the world, he says, “I don’t know a disease that wreaks such havoc on the body and on the mind.” Which is perhaps why his dying patient was pleading with him so desperately just before being intubated to tell people to wear their masks and take the virus seriously.

Because otherwise, it will continue to take thousands of lives this way each day in the US until we can get vaccines to almost everyone.

2021-02-22 23:14:55+00:00,21,"We’ve reached half a million deaths from the coronavirus in the US. But most of these deaths — and the grueling medical ordeals leading up to them — have remained largely hidden from view. The majority of terminally ill Covid-19 patients typically spend their last days or weeks isolated in ICUs to keep the virus from spreading.

“Most of what I’m seeing is behind closed curtains, and the general public isn’t seeing this side of it,” says Todd Rice, a critical care and pulmonology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Even “families are only seeing a little bit of it,” he says. As a result, most of us have been “protected and sheltered from seeing the worst of this disease.”

So what have these 500,000 people endured as the infection took over and their bodies failed? The terrible details have been strikingly absent from most of our personal and national discussions about the virus. But if we have been thus far (perhaps somewhat willfully) blind to the excruciating ways Covid-19 takes lives, this milestone is an opportunity to open our eyes.

Four physicians, who collectively have cared for more than 100 dying Covid-19 patients over the past 11 months, shared with Vox what their patients have gone through physically and mentally as the virus killed them. Their experiences reveal the isolating and invasive realities of what it is typically like for someone to die from Covid-19.

Lungs “full of bees” and a “sense of impending doom”

The torture of Covid-19 can begin long before someone is sick enough to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.

Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, it hampers the intake of oxygen. People with worsening Covid-19 typically show up in the emergency room because they are having trouble breathing.

As their lungs deteriorate further, they have a harder and harder time getting enough oxygen with each breath, meaning they need to breathe faster and faster — up from an average of about 14 times per minute to 30 or 40. Such gasping can bring about a very real sense of panic.

Imagine trying to breathe through a very narrow straw, says Jess Mandel, chief of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine at UC San Diego Health. “You can do that for 15 to 20 seconds, but try doing it for two hours.” Or for days or weeks.

Patients struggling through low oxygen levels like this have told Kenneth Remy, an assistant professor of critical care medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, that it feels like a band across their chest or that their lungs are on fire. Or like a thousand bees stinging them inside their chest. Others might have thick secretions in their lungs that make it feel like they are trying to breathe through muck. Many people say it feels like they’re being smothered.

The ordeal is so taxing that many wish for death. “You hear the patients say, ‘I just want to die because this is so excruciating,’” Remy says. “That’s what this virus does.”

“I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy”

Others feel that death is coming no matter what they do. Rice notes that is much more so for his Covid-19 patients than others he has treated. There seems to be something about Covid-19, he says, “that makes people prone to having a feeling of, ‘I really believe I’m going to die.’”

Meilinh Thi, who specializes in critical care and pulmonology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, has witnessed the same thing. “A lot of patients, regardless of age, have this sense of impending doom,” Thi says. Many have told her outright they felt like they were going to die. Eerily, “Everyone who has told me that has passed away,” she says.

Isolated

The agony of being critically ill with Covid-19 isn’t just borne by the body but also by the mind. “It doesn’t only put your lungs on fire or give you a horrible headache or make you feel miserable or make you breathe really fast,” Remy says. “It also wreaks havoc on your mental state.”

For one, from the time anyone with Covid-19 is admitted to the hospital, they are essentially cut off from almost everything that is familiar. Most Covid-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that some are also dying in long-term care facilities (about 10 percent) or at home (about 6 percent).

“A lot of patients have told me how isolating and how lonely it is,” Thi says. And many get depressed. It is also incredibly scary to reach that point of illness with a disease that we know has already killed so many people, she and others point out.

All of these challenges have a cumulative effect. “If you can understand being in the hospital for two, three weeks, continuously breathing that fast, not having good interactions with your family because they can’t come and visit you — it’s extremely anxiety-provoking. It’s scary,” Remy says.

Being in the ICU for any reason also vastly increases a person’s risk for delirium, a state of confusion that can result in agitation, fear, and anger. Medications used to sedate people or relieve pain (both common in Covid-19 treatment) are part of the reason for this risk, as are the constant monitoring and physical disturbances — and subsequent sleep disruption.

Being a Covid-19 patient increases this likelihood of disorientation even more. Some estimates put the rate of delirium among adult ICU Covid-19 patients at about 65 percent.

One reason for this extra risk is that the only people patients see are covered in head-to-toe PPE, often with only their eye area visible behind a shield or goggles, rendering them even more anonymous and unfamiliar. (ICU nurses have described working alongside the same people for decades and now not recognizing them due to all the protective gear.) “That for sure increases the risk of delirium,” Thi says.

As a Covid-19 patient, “You’re just devoid of human contact to a large degree,” Mandel says.

And that is no small thing. With loved ones relegated to video calls, personal connection through in-person visits — typically a mainstay during an intensive hospital stay — is gone.

“If your mom or dad or spouse was in the hospital and was very sick, you would be at their bedside holding their hand,” Remy says. With fatal Covid-19, your last meaningful contact with family, before your final hours, might be as you get admitted into the ER, days or weeks before.

Doctors often have to use many invasive procedures to try to save lives

Anyone unwell enough to be in the ICU for any reason will be hooked up to lots of machines. But people with severe Covid-19 face a particularly grueling and invasive experience.

When people can no longer breathe for themselves and still aren’t getting enough oxygen from external sources (like short nose tubes or a BiPap machine, like those some people wear for sleep apnea), the next step is usually putting them on a ventilator.

To do this, patients are put on IV-based sedation and pain medication so they can tolerate the procedure. A tube is inserted into the mouth and down the airway so the machine can pump air into the lungs. The tube can remain there for days or weeks, during which time that person will remain heavily sedated and unable to talk. (This sedation can also mask other problems that arise during their illness, such as major strokes.)

“The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around”

Those who have survived the ordeal often don’t even remember the day leading up to being put on ventilation, Thi says. “They say they really just lost that portion of their life.”

The ventilator itself is not without risks. For example, if the machine is set to deliver too much air, it can cause additional lung damage. And the breathing tube only tends to be safe to keep in place for about two to three weeks, Thi notes. After that, it can start to deteriorate. At that point, doctors might surgically insert a tube into the patient’s neck — a procedure known as a tracheostomy — to connect them to the ventilator.

For some, even mechanical ventilation can’t get them enough oxygen. These patients often get put on “heart-lung” machines, which pump blood out of the body, through a machine that oxygenates it, and back in. (These are also sometimes used for people who have suffered a heart attack, and are known to have numerous side effects, such as increased risk for strokes as well as for agitation and delirium.) This process requires two large catheters (long tubes) inserted into a major artery or vein, so the machine can effectively pump enough blood in and out of the body.

Flipping people onto their stomachs has also helped get more air into their systems. During this practice, called proning, the sick individual is typically put on a medication to paralyze them so they cannot move. (Medical staff also turn incapacitated patients in bed every couple of hours “to make sure their skin doesn’t break down,” Thi says.)

A significant proportion of people — somewhere between about 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 — who get very sick with Covid-19 also end up with kidney failure. To prevent this from killing them, they’re put on dialysis machines, which take blood out of the body and filter it before returning it to the body. This procedure can cause nausea, cramping, and chronic itching. Anyone getting dialysis will need two additional large catheters put into another major blood vessel.

But these aren’t all of the tubes critically ill Covid-19 patients need. ﻿They also have a central venous catheter to administer medication. This long tube usually gets inserted into a major vein in the clavicle or groin, then is pushed through the vein until it reaches the heart, where it will stay until that person recovers or dies. Another catheter, sometimes put in near the groin, will take the person’s blood for analysis.

Other catheters will be inserted into the urethra to drain urine (which is monitored closely) and the rectum to frequently evacuate their feces (which is especially important because Covid-19 often causes diarrhea). Additional IVs, such as for hydration and medications, will poke patients in smaller vessels as well. People this ill with Covid-19 will also have a tube put into their mouth or nose and down into their stomach, to deliver a nutritious slurry to prevent malnutrition.

On top of all of these tubes and needles, a number of other beeping and humming devices monitor a person’s vitals. Leads attached to the chest track heart function, and a pulse oximeter on the finger keeps tabs on oxygen saturation. A standard cuff monitors blood pressure, but people often get an additional catheter into yet another vessel to measure blood pressure from within that artery.

All of these incredibly invasive interventions have a goal of sustaining the body simply so that it can try to fight off the virus and heal. “The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around,” Mandel says. “It’s always a race.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious disease expert, said Sunday that the death toll is “almost unbelievable.”

“But it’s true,” Fauci told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Sunday. “This is a devastating pandemic. And it’s historic. People will be talking about this decades and decades and decades from now.”

The grim milestone, likely an undercount, comes after a bleak winter. For much of January, the US reported well over 3,000 Covid-19 deaths each day. Overall case numbers also exploded: Since early December, 14 million more people have tested positive for the virus, doubling the total number of US cases.

As of Saturday, the US is still reporting a seven-day rolling average of more than 1,900 deaths per day, though cases have fallen sharply to levels last seen in October 2020.

Today's COVID-19 case count is the lowest on a Saturday since Oct 17. pic.twitter.com/snooZIAUlk — The COVID Tracking Project (@COVID19Tracking) February 21, 2021

More than in any other country, the virus has been allowed to rage out of control in the US. According to the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dashboard, the US has almost twice as many Covid-19 deaths as Brazil, which is second in deaths, and over 17 million more total confirmed cases than India, which is second in cases. Of the more than 2.46 million deaths from Covid-19 worldwide, the US has recorded slightly more than one-fifth.

In late March last year, Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the former White House coronavirus task force coordinator, predicted that 240,000 deaths would be on the high end of the possible US death toll; the country hit that mark in mid-November, according to CNN’s Ryan Struyk, and the death toll has more than doubled since then.

As the New York Times pointed out on Sunday, half a million US deaths also exceeds the US death toll “on the battlefields of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined.”

There are reasons to be hopeful as the US picks up the pace with vaccinations

As March approaches, however, an accelerating vaccination campaign and falling cases offer hope that things could improve soon — and maybe even return to something resembling normal by the summer.

Currently, according to CNN, the US is administering about 1.5 million doses of vaccine per day, but public health officials believe that number could pick up soon. On Sunday, Fauci told CNN’s Dana Bash that “of course you’d like to see” over 2 million doses per day being administered by the end of April.

Vaccine availability should also begin to open up in the late spring or summer, Fauci said earlier this week, and by July, the country would “likely have all 600 million doses that we contracted for to vaccinate 300 million people.”

As of Sunday, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracker, the US had administered more than 63 million vaccine doses. Because both of the vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use thus far require two shots to be fully effective, that’s not the same as the number of people actually vaccinated. But 17 million people have still received both doses of the vaccine, and many more have had their first of two shots.

Research suggests that even one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was the first vaccine candidate to be approved for emergency use in the US, can provide “robust immunity” from symptomatic cases of the disease. Additionally, Pfizer data first reported on Sunday indicates that the vaccine is almost 90 percent effective at preventing virus transmission outside a clinical setting, a hopeful finding for vaccines’ ability to keep infection levels low.

The data about virus transmission — which comes from an Israeli study — has yet to be peer-reviewed, but it’s still a promising early sign. According to Bloomberg, Pfizer and BioNTech “are working on a real-world analysis of data from Israel, which will be shared as soon as it’s complete.”

As vaccinations pick up, case numbers in the US are also falling dramatically. As the Atlantic’s James Hamblin points out, that could bode well for the summer.

If vaccination rates continue to rise and case numbers continue to fall, “it would mean that many aspects of pre-pandemic life will return even before summer is upon us,” Hamblin wrote Friday. “Because case numbers guide local policies, much of the country could soon have reason to lift many or even most restrictions on distancing, gathering, and masking. Pre-pandemic norms could return to schools, churches, and restaurants. Sports, theater, and cultural events could resume. People could travel and dance indoors and hug grandparents, their own or others’.”

Still, top public health officials are preaching caution as things begin to look up in the US, particularly as Covid-19 variants continue to spread in the country.

Last Sunday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned that a more infectious — and possibly more deadly — coronavirus variant first seen in the UK could become “the dominant strain by the end of March.”

“Now more than ever, with continued spread of variants that stand to threaten the progress we are making, we must recommit to doing our part to protect one another,” Walensky said at a press conference Friday. “Wear a well-fitting mask, social distance, avoid travel and crowds, practice good hand hygiene, and get vaccinated when the vaccine is available to you.”

And mask-wearing will likely be necessary for some time yet. Fauci told CNN on Sunday that Americans may still need to wear masks in 2022, and noted on Fox News Sunday that it could take until next year for children, particularly young children, to be vaccinated.",voxdotcom,"['half', 'deaths', 'according', 'covid19', 'case', 'vaccine', 'surpassed', 'million', 'fauci', 'cases', 'death', 'doses']",0
2021-02-22 22:18:56+00:00,23,"When the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, it may have seemed like a distant threat. But very quickly, the tiny pathogen made its way around the world, bringing sickness and death wherever it went. In America, the first known Covid-19 fatality occurred on February 6, 2020. From there, the wave of daily deaths started rising. By the end of May 2020, the virus had taken 100,000 lives, mostly in the Northeast and major cities. Four months later, the death toll surpassed 200,000. Less than three months later, by mid-December, more than 300,000 people had died. With the virus spreading all over the US, it took only 36 more days to reach 400,000 deaths. January was the deadliest month so far.

Who has died from Covid-19 in the US? The virus was unsparing.

Across the country, more than 28 million people have contracted the coronavirus, and over 500,000 have died. That’s the highest Covid-19 toll of any country and more than the coronavirus deaths in Italy, Germany, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, and France combined. It exceeds the US death toll in World War II. It’s also an underestimate, and doesn’t account for all the people impacted by loss. If every American who died has left nine people grieving, as one study suggested, there are now more than 4 million Americans who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. Death at this scale is difficult to comprehend, or visualize. To get a clearer sense of the shifting burden of Covid-19 deaths over time, Vox analyzed coronavirus mortality by age, region, and race from the past year, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. We found that while Covid-19 spared no group, it impacted certain populations more than others. Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus. They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black. But what started as a health emergency concentrated in travelers, urban minority communities, and other crowded places (such as nursing homes and prisons) fanned out into rural areas of the country, leading to a surge in deaths among white people, too. In the deaths, we saw how an “infectious disease became a universal issue,” said Boston University School of Public Health dean Sandro Galea. The extraordinary loss of life was also preventable, said Virginia Commonwealth University’s Steven Woolf, and a grim marker of “how poorly the US handled the pandemic.” By the winter of 2020, the virus was spreading broadly in every state, and largely by people younger than 50. Still, disparities in lives lost have persisted.

A trend at the start of the US outbreak has held: People of color have died of Covid-19 at much higher rates — double the rate of white people overall in 2020. But over the course of the year, the share of Covid-19 deaths among white people grew, while the share among Black and Hispanic people decreased.

In absolute terms, the death rate among white people rose significantly, while the rate among people of color dropped slightly. This was a trend we found in communities across America as Covid-19 spread. Deaths shifted from diverse counties to those with a higher share of white people

Experts attribute the change to the evolving geography of the virus — a result of the failure by states and the federal government to curtail transmission. At the start of the US outbreak, coronavirus cases — and deaths — were concentrated in a few cities, which have large numbers of people of color who are more likely to do essential work. “The impact of Covid-19 was limited to New York, and to a lesser extent Detroit and New Orleans,” said Dartmouth health economist Jonathan Skinner, “and in particular among people who had to commute by public transportation to service-sector jobs.” Many Black and Hispanic people soon contracted the virus and died at very high rates — an estimated 118,000 in 2020 overall. By October, some of the most sparsely populated areas of the country — Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska — were grappling with America’s worst outbreaks. The relative share of deaths among white people started rising. “The politics of 2020 led governors in [these] parts of the country to be less aggressive in dealing with the virus or actively discourage public health safeguards,” Woolf said. At the same time, more states adopted face-mask orders and other safety measures. Mask mandates helped bring case numbers down, and may have saved the lives of some essential workers. The result: In August, Black people died at 2.5 times the rate of white people. By November, the rate was 2.2. In early February, it was 1.5. But minorities were disproportionately affected by the virus in every month of 2020. They were also much more likely to die young.

Your screen is too small to view this graphic Of people who died of Covid-19 between the ages of 35 and 44, nearly half were Hispanic and a quarter were Black. “We would have otherwise expected them to live decades,” said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health. Of people over age 85 who died of Covid-19, 80 percent were white. Of those who died between the ages of 35 and 44, only 20 percent were white.

The data also reveals that regardless of race or geography, there is one group that has consistently experienced an extraordinarily high risk of death: the elderly. Age remains the greatest predictor overall of who lives after infection with the coronavirus and who dies.

Nearly half of all 2020 Covid-19 deaths were of people age 80 or older. If you include people age 60 or older, the share of deaths reaches almost 90 percent. With confirmed cases, the picture looks very different: Younger people, ages 20 to 59, are somewhat overrepresented.

In March through May, people age 80 and older had the most confirmed cases per capita (although testing for much of this time was limited). By June, that burden shifted to younger people. The summer case surge in young people was followed by a winter uptick in elderly deaths

2021-02-22 22:13:48+00:00,30,"We’ve reached half a million deaths from the coronavirus in the US. But most of these deaths — and the grueling medical ordeals leading up to them — have remained largely hidden from view. The majority of terminally ill Covid-19 patients typically spend their last days or weeks isolated in ICUs to keep the virus from spreading.

“Most of what I’m seeing is behind closed curtains, and the general public isn’t seeing this side of it,” says Todd Rice, a critical care and pulmonology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Even “families are only seeing a little bit of it,” he says. As a result, most of us have been “protected and sheltered from seeing the worst of this disease.”

So what have these 500,000 people endured as the infection took over and their bodies failed? The terrible details have been strikingly absent from most of our personal and national discussions about the virus. But if we have been thus far (perhaps somewhat willfully) blind to the excruciating ways Covid-19 takes lives, this milestone is an opportunity to open our eyes.

Four physicians, who collectively have cared for more than 100 dying Covid-19 patients over the past 11 months, shared with Vox what their patients have gone through physically and mentally as the virus killed them. Their experiences reveal the isolating and invasive realities of what it is typically like for someone to die from Covid-19.

Lungs “full of bees” and a “sense of impending doom”

The torture of Covid-19 can begin long before someone is sick enough to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.

Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, it hampers the intake of oxygen. People with worsening Covid-19 typically show up in the emergency room because they are having trouble breathing.

As their lungs deteriorate further, they have a harder and harder time getting enough oxygen with each breath, meaning they need to breathe faster and faster — up from an average of about 14 times per minute to 30 or 40. Such gasping can bring about a very real sense of panic.

Imagine trying to breathe through a very narrow straw, says Jess Mandel, chief of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine at UC San Diego Health. “You can do that for 15 to 20 seconds, but try doing it for two hours.” Or for days or weeks.

Patients struggling through low oxygen levels like this have told Kenneth Remy, an assistant professor of critical care medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, that it feels like a band across their chest or that their lungs are on fire. Or like a thousand bees stinging them inside their chest. Others might have thick secretions in their lungs that make it feel like they are trying to breathe through muck. Many people say it feels like they’re being smothered.

The ordeal is so taxing that many wish for death. “You hear the patients say, ‘I just want to die because this is so excruciating,’” Remy says. “That’s what this virus does.”

“I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy”

Others feel that death is coming no matter what they do. Rice notes that is much more so for his Covid-19 patients than others he has treated. There seems to be something about Covid-19, he says, “that makes people prone to having a feeling of, ‘I really believe I’m going to die.’”

Meilinh Thi, who specializes in critical care and pulmonology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, has witnessed the same thing. “A lot of patients, regardless of age, have this sense of impending doom,” Thi says. Many have told her outright they felt like they were going to die. Eerily, “Everyone who has told me that has passed away,” she says.

Isolated

The agony of being critically ill with Covid-19 isn’t just borne by the body but also by the mind. “It doesn’t only put your lungs on fire or give you a horrible headache or make you feel miserable or make you breathe really fast,” Remy says. “It also wreaks havoc on your mental state.”

For one, from the time anyone with Covid-19 is admitted to the hospital, they are essentially cut off from almost everything that is familiar. Most Covid-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that some are also dying in long-term care facilities (about 10 percent) or at home (about 6 percent).

“A lot of patients have told me how isolating and how lonely it is,” Thi says. And many get depressed. It is also incredibly scary to reach that point of illness with a disease that we know has already killed so many people, she and others point out.

All of these challenges have a cumulative effect. “If you can understand being in the hospital for two, three weeks, continuously breathing that fast, not having good interactions with your family because they can’t come and visit you — it’s extremely anxiety-provoking. It’s scary,” Remy says.

Being in the ICU for any reason also vastly increases a person’s risk for delirium, a state of confusion that can result in agitation, fear, and anger. Medications used to sedate people or relieve pain (both common in Covid-19 treatment) are part of the reason for this risk, as are the constant monitoring and physical disturbances — and subsequent sleep disruption.

Being a Covid-19 patient increases this likelihood of disorientation even more. Some estimates put the rate of delirium among adult ICU Covid-19 patients at about 65 percent.

One reason for this extra risk is that the only people patients see are covered in head-to-toe PPE, often with only their eye area visible behind a shield or goggles, rendering them even more anonymous and unfamiliar. (ICU nurses have described working alongside the same people for decades and now not recognizing them due to all the protective gear.) “That for sure increases the risk of delirium,” Thi says.

As a Covid-19 patient, “You’re just devoid of human contact to a large degree,” Mandel says.

And that is no small thing. With loved ones relegated to video calls, personal connection through in-person visits — typically a mainstay during an intensive hospital stay — is gone.

“If your mom or dad or spouse was in the hospital and was very sick, you would be at their bedside holding their hand,” Remy says. With fatal Covid-19, your last meaningful contact with family, before your final hours, might be as you get admitted into the ER, days or weeks before.

Doctors often have to use many invasive procedures to try to save lives

Anyone unwell enough to be in the ICU for any reason will be hooked up to lots of machines. But people with severe Covid-19 face a particularly grueling and invasive experience.

When people can no longer breathe for themselves and still aren’t getting enough oxygen from external sources (like short nose tubes or a BiPap machine, like those some people wear for sleep apnea), the next step is usually putting them on a ventilator.

To do this, patients are put on IV-based sedation and pain medication so they can tolerate the procedure. A tube is inserted into the mouth and down the airway so the machine can pump air into the lungs. The tube can remain there for days or weeks, during which time that person will remain heavily sedated and unable to talk. (This sedation can also mask other problems that arise during their illness, such as major strokes.)

“The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around”

Those who have survived the ordeal often don’t even remember the day leading up to being put on ventilation, Thi says. “They say they really just lost that portion of their life.”

The ventilator itself is not without risks. For example, if the machine is set to deliver too much air, it can cause additional lung damage. And the breathing tube only tends to be safe to keep in place for about two to three weeks, Thi notes. After that, it can start to deteriorate. At that point, doctors might surgically insert a tube into the patient’s neck — a procedure known as a tracheostomy — to connect them to the ventilator.

For some, even mechanical ventilation can’t get them enough oxygen. These patients often get put on “heart-lung” machines, which pump blood out of the body, through a machine that oxygenates it, and back in. (These are also sometimes used for people who have suffered a heart attack, and are known to have numerous side effects, such as increased risk for strokes as well as for agitation and delirium.) This process requires two large catheters (long tubes) inserted into a major artery or vein, so the machine can effectively pump enough blood in and out of the body.

Flipping people onto their stomachs has also helped get more air into their systems. During this practice, called proning, the sick individual is typically put on a medication to paralyze them so they cannot move. (Medical staff also turn incapacitated patients in bed every couple of hours “to make sure their skin doesn’t break down,” Thi says.)

A significant proportion of people — somewhere between about 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 — who get very sick with Covid-19 also end up with kidney failure. To prevent this from killing them, they’re put on dialysis machines, which take blood out of the body and filter it before returning it to the body. This procedure can cause nausea, cramping, and chronic itching. Anyone getting dialysis will need two additional large catheters put into another major blood vessel.

But these aren’t all of the tubes critically ill Covid-19 patients need. ﻿They also have a central venous catheter to administer medication. This long tube usually gets inserted into a major vein in the clavicle or groin, then is pushed through the vein until it reaches the heart, where it will stay until that person recovers or dies. Another catheter, sometimes put in near the groin, will take the person’s blood for analysis.

Other catheters will be inserted into the urethra to drain urine (which is monitored closely) and the rectum to frequently evacuate their feces (which is especially important because Covid-19 often causes diarrhea). Additional IVs, such as for hydration and medications, will poke patients in smaller vessels as well. People this ill with Covid-19 will also have a tube put into their mouth or nose and down into their stomach, to deliver a nutritious slurry to prevent malnutrition.

On top of all of these tubes and needles, a number of other beeping and humming devices monitor a person’s vitals. Leads attached to the chest track heart function, and a pulse oximeter on the finger keeps tabs on oxygen saturation. A standard cuff monitors blood pressure, but people often get an additional catheter into yet another vessel to measure blood pressure from within that artery.

All of these incredibly invasive interventions have a goal of sustaining the body simply so that it can try to fight off the virus and heal. “The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around,” Mandel says. “It’s always a race.”

But even all of these procedures — alongside treatments like dexamethasone and remdesivir — are not enough to save everyone with Covid-19. Some people decline to go through some or all of this, or at least to endure it indefinitely, but that does not guarantee a lack of suffering. And for those most unlucky 1.8 percent of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in the US, death will then be imminent.

The end

Once someone is sick enough with Covid-19 that they need a ventilator, their chance of survival is somewhere between 40 and 60 percent, notes Remy. “You flip a coin, and you may be one of those people who die,” he says.

Remy recalls one particularly difficult week during the fall surge when he cared for a number of people in their 40s and 50s who ultimately died. Most of them were obese but otherwise healthy when they caught Covid-19 by not wearing a mask.

“One of the[se] patients specifically told me before I put the breathing tube in, ‘Let everyone know that this is real, my lungs are on fire. It’s like there’s bees stinging me. I can’t breathe. Please let them know to wear a mask ... because I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.’”

Right after that patient died, Remy made a precautionary video that he posted on Twitter.

Please listen as this is dire. I don’t want to be the last person that looks in your frightened eyes. #MaskUp ⁦@DrKenRemy1⁩ ⁦@WUSTLmed⁩ pic.twitter.com/qwb4eERlfE — Kenneth E. Remy, MD, MHSc, FCCM (@DrKenRemy1) November 21, 2020

If a patient’s breathing deteriorates slowly, hospitals can often arrange a way for them to talk with family members before they get intubated. Because after the tube goes in, they might not be conscious or able to talk again before they die. Regardless, the last person they have conscious contact with is typically a member of the medical staff before they are heavily sedated to receive the ventilator tube. In essence, “It could be anybody,” Rice says.

Despite the strict isolation for Covid-19 patients, “We try to make sure patients don’t die alone,” Thi says. For those who quickly nosedive, there often isn’t time to bring in family. Those people die surrounded by medical staff, either receiving CPR or, if they had do not resuscitate orders, with staff standing by.

For those who fall toward death, family — in full PPE — are now typically allowed in (which wasn’t usually the case at the beginning of the pandemic). At that point, “We would proceed with comfort measures only,” Thi says. In this scenario, the dying person will be on heavy medication as the ventilator tube is removed. Even still, once it gets taken out, people often gasp or cough as the body fights for air before they die.

Despite the palliative care and the possibility for family to now be present for a person’s actual death, doctors describe Covid-19 as a uniquely terrible way to die. “Covid is just so different,” Thi says. “I don’t think anything could be comparable to it. ... I don’t wish it on my worst enemy.”

Remy agrees. After having cared for patients dying from infectious diseases all over the world, he says, “I don’t know a disease that wreaks such havoc on the body and on the mind.” Which is perhaps why his dying patient was pleading with him so desperately just before being intubated to tell people to wear their masks and take the virus seriously.

Because otherwise, it will continue to take thousands of lives this way each day in the US until we can get vaccines to almost everyone.

2021-02-22 13:30:09+00:00,8,"In the coming months, America could reach a point when it has more Covid-19 vaccines than people want.

Between efforts from the federal government and drug companies to step up manufacturing and distribution, the US’s vaccine supply is truly increasing: At least 150 million doses are expected through March — a rate of more than 3 million shots a day, the kind of speed the country needs to reach herd immunity, when enough people are protected against the virus to stop its spread, this summer.

But public health experts are increasingly warning of what may come as America inches closer to the finish line in its vaccine campaign: After the majority of people who want a vaccine get one, there’s a large minority of people who have voiced skepticism in public surveys. And if these people don’t change their minds in the coming months, they could doom any chance the US has of reaching herd immunity.

“There’s going to be a point … where there’s going to be vaccine available, and getting people to take it will be the primary issue,” Emily Brunson, a medical anthropologist at Texas State University, told me.

To reach herd immunity, experts generally estimate that we’ll need to vaccinate at least 70 to 80 percent of the population — though it could be more or less, because we don’t really know for sure with a new virus. Yet according to a recent AP-NORC survey, 32 percent of Americans say they definitely or probably won’t get a Covid-19 vaccine. If that holds and the herd immunity estimates are correct, it would make herd immunity impossible.

Public health experts say there are ways to make people more willing to get vaccinated, but such efforts have to be flexible to match the different concerns about a vaccine different communities and individuals may hold. What might sway skeptical white Republicans who don’t see Covid-19 as a threat won’t necessarily work for Black communities that are distrustful of a medical establishment that has long neglected and even abused them.

Whatever anti-hesitancy campaigns take shape, though, must happen quickly. With every day the coronavirus continues to spread across America, the country sets itself up for hundreds if not thousands more deaths a day — not to mention the constant need for social distancing, a weakened economy, and potentially harsher restrictions on daily life. Each day of uncontrolled spread also brings the risk of new, more dangerous coronavirus variants, as each replication of the virus carries the risk of a mutation that catches on more widely.

Now, the days when hesitancy becomes the top vaccine problem may still be up to months away. But if the pandemic should have taught us anything, it’s that it’s better to be proactive than reactive. It’s not too late to get ahead of this problem before it becomes the next major bottleneck in America’s efforts to end its outbreak.

The US’s vaccine supply problem is getting better

The past few weeks have brought a lot of genuinely good news on the vaccine front.

The number of shots delivered has increased dramatically, from less than 1 million a day in mid-January to around 1.7 million in mid-February. (Though recent snowstorms likely slowed that down.) As bad as America’s initial rollout was, the US is still ahead of all countries except Israel, Seychelles, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom in vaccination rates — and it’s improving quickly enough, so far, to sustain that lead.

There have also recently been fewer mishaps at the state level. There were some alarming reports during the first few weeks of the rollout — machines breaking down, staffing issues, doses going unused. These problems still pop up (the US is big, and someone is always causing trouble here), but they seem to be happening less frequently as states and localities get the hang of the process. To this end, states are using much more of their vaccines: While it was rare for a state to report administering more than 60 percent of vaccine doses in January, it’s now pretty common for them to report using more than 80 or 90 percent.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s administration has made some strides to improve both the supply of vaccines sent to states and communication with states on what supplies they can expect. The latter is particularly important because it lets states plan for the doses they’re getting — something they weren’t often able to do in the early stages of the vaccine rollout, as they would find out how many vaccines they were getting as late as the day they got the doses. That might help explain why states have been doing better.

There are still plenty of problems. The current rate of 1.7 million shots a day is still too slow; experts would like the country to get to 2 million or 3 million to get through the bulk of vaccine efforts this summer. While the country seems to be on track to get enough doses to do that next month, the question then becomes whether it has the distribution capacity to actually turn those doses into shots in arms — and the logistical challenges there will be immense.

Still, a world where there are enough vaccines to go around is rapidly approaching. Biden said vaccines will be available to all Americans by the end of July, while Anthony Fauci, the top federal infectious disease expert, took a slightly more optimistic outlook in saying it would be “open season” in late May or early June.

At that point, vaccine hesitancy may make supply less of a problem than demand.

America has a hesitancy problem

The views of one-third of Americans may not always amount to a national crisis, but those views matter a lot when the country needs to do something that requires nearly everybody on board. That’s the case with the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, where 70 or 80 percent — or more — of the country will need to get vaccinated to reach herd immunity. So surveys that show as many as one-third of Americans are skeptical amount to a real public health crisis.

Compounding that is the reality that a Covid-19 vaccine still hasn’t been approved for children — and that might not happen until later this summer or even 2022. Given that kids make up 22 percent of the population, herd immunity probably can’t happen without them. But even if herd immunity only requires the lower estimate of 70 percent of Americans, that still will be impossible if more than 30 percent of adults refuse a vaccine.

Based on public surveys, particularly in-depth ones from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the skeptical report a variety of concerns regarding the Covid-19 vaccine.

A major one is concerns about side effects, particularly long-term health consequences. The Covid-19 vaccines do have side effects, but they’re almost entirely minor — temporary aches, fever, and cold-like symptoms — aside from rare allergic reactions, which require monitoring but are treatable. Still, people worry about the risks.

Some of the skeptics worry that the vaccine approval process, given its record speed, was rushed. But the Covid-19 vaccines still went through the three-phase clinical trial process required by the Food and Drug Administration, testing for safety and efficacy. The vaccines have also been out in the real world for months now, with still no reports of previously unknown and serious effects.

Some people of color also distrust the health care system, based on their experiences with a system that’s often discriminatory and a history of experimentation on Black bodies, such as the Tuskegee study. Surveys show that Latinos and Black people, in particular, are less likely to trust doctors and hospitals in general. That’s likely fed into distrust toward the vaccine, too.

A segment of the population, particularly on the right of the political spectrum, is also skeptical they even need a Covid-19 vaccine. Encouraged by people like former President Donald Trump, they tend to believe the threat of the coronavirus has long been overplayed in the media. Given other potential concerns, for instance about side effects and a rushed process, they question whether they should get a vaccine, believing that Covid-19 isn’t really a threat to them. The reality is it’s a threat to everyone — killing more people under 55 alone than all murders in a typical year — but the perception remains.

Then there are the concerns that fall more in the conspiracy theory camp, whether about certain wealthy people’s involvement in the vaccine process or more traditional (and debunked) anti-vaxxer concerns. But those tend to make up a very small minority of the US public and even Covid-19 vaccine skeptics.

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution

As the list above demonstrates, concerns about vaccines tend to vary and can differ significantly from community to community. Some concerns may not even show up in national surveys at all — they might be too localized to ever appear. This is a critical fact of public health, but it especially applies here: Local problems require local solutions, meaning messaging to combat vaccine hesitancy will have to be tailored differently from community to community.

“There will be similarities, and I think there will be some overlapping issues,” Brunson said. “But there will be local iterations of this that can vary quite widely.”

That doesn’t mean states or federal governments have no role to play. To the contrary, a big federal campaign about the basic facts, particularly the benefits, of the vaccines could be really helpful — and, in fact, experts have repeatedly told me such a campaign should have started months ago. Federal and state governments can also provide support, with money, personnel, guidance, and expertise, that local governments will need to execute on their plans.

The underlying theme of these campaigns, experts say, should be to meet people where they are. That begins with really hearing the community’s concerns, then transparently and honestly walking through why the vaccines’ benefits still dramatically outweigh any downsides. Doing that could require, at some points, acknowledging that people have a point — for example, the US health care system really does have a history of racism — but making the case that the evidence for vaccines is still strong and they’re still worth taking.

The messaging will have to be tested, and what works best will, again, likely differ from place to place and person to person. But experts pointed to several ideas: Campaigns can point to the evidence that the vaccines are very effective, particularly that they, based on the clinical trials, drive Covid-19 deaths down to zero and hospitalizations to almost zero. They can highlight the importance of everyone getting vaccinated to reach herd immunity and, subsequently, protect not just yourself but your friends, family, and community. They can tap into trusted or beloved sources, including doctors but also potentially celebrities.

A more controversial idea is to tell people about the personal benefits of the vaccines. Some of the public health messaging in the US has actually obscured this — telling people that even if they get a vaccine, they won’t be able to go back to their normal, pre-coronavirus lives right away.

Still, some experts argue that the restrained messaging can drive people to ask, “Why bother?” Masking and social distancing should be encouraged until America reaches herd immunity or close to it because we don’t yet know how effective vaccines are in driving down transmission. But people should be trusted with factual information about how vaccines will make certain activities less risky for them and others who get inoculated — and maybe they could safely enjoy some of those activities with their vaccinated friends and family once again.

“People undersell the vaccine,” Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. “They don’t understand that if you tell people nothing changes when they get a vaccine — which I don’t think is true — then they’re not going to have an incentive to get the vaccine.”

Whatever form a pro-vaccine effort takes, experts are in agreement — and they have been for a long time — that some kind of big anti-hesitancy campaign needs to get going soon. Really, it should have started yesterday or last year. But there’s still time to act before the country gets to the point where supply is outstripping demand.

2021-02-21 22:00:05+00:00,16,"On Monday, just over a year after the first known Covid-19 death in the United States, the US surpassed 500,000 confirmed deaths from the coronavirus.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious disease expert, said Sunday that the death toll is “almost unbelievable.”

“But it’s true,” Fauci told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Sunday. “This is a devastating pandemic. And it’s historic. People will be talking about this decades and decades and decades from now.”

The grim milestone, likely an undercount, comes after a bleak winter. For much of January, the US reported well over 3,000 Covid-19 deaths each day. Overall case numbers also exploded: Since early December, 14 million more people have tested positive for the virus, doubling the total number of US cases.

As of Saturday, the US is still reporting a seven-day rolling average of more than 1,900 deaths per day, though cases have fallen sharply to levels last seen in October 2020.

Today's COVID-19 case count is the lowest on a Saturday since Oct 17. pic.twitter.com/snooZIAUlk — The COVID Tracking Project (@COVID19Tracking) February 21, 2021

More than in any other country, the virus has been allowed to rage out of control in the US. According to the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dashboard, the US has almost twice as many Covid-19 deaths as Brazil, which is second in deaths, and over 17 million more total confirmed cases than India, which is second in cases. Of the more than 2.46 million deaths from Covid-19 worldwide, the US has recorded slightly more than one-fifth.

In late March last year, Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the former White House coronavirus task force coordinator, predicted that 240,000 deaths would be on the high end of the possible US death toll; the country hit that mark in mid-November, according to CNN’s Ryan Struyk, and the death toll has more than doubled since then.

As the New York Times pointed out on Sunday, half a million US deaths also exceeds the US death toll “on the battlefields of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined.”

There are reasons to be hopeful as the US picks up the pace with vaccinations

As March approaches, however, an accelerating vaccination campaign and falling cases offer hope that things could improve soon — and maybe even return to something resembling normal by the summer.

Currently, according to CNN, the US is administering about 1.5 million doses of vaccine per day, but public health officials believe that number could pick up soon. On Sunday, Fauci told CNN’s Dana Bash that “of course you’d like to see” over 2 million doses per day being administered by the end of April.

Vaccine availability should also begin to open up in the late spring or summer, Fauci said earlier this week, and by July, the country would “likely have all 600 million doses that we contracted for to vaccinate 300 million people.”

As of Sunday, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracker, the US had administered more than 63 million vaccine doses. Because both of the vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use thus far require two shots to be fully effective, that’s not the same as the number of people actually vaccinated. But 17 million people have still received both doses of the vaccine, and many more have had their first of two shots.

Research suggests that even one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was the first vaccine candidate to be approved for emergency use in the US, can provide “robust immunity” from symptomatic cases of the disease. Additionally, Pfizer data first reported on Sunday indicates that the vaccine is almost 90 percent effective at preventing virus transmission outside a clinical setting, a hopeful finding for vaccines’ ability to keep infection levels low.

The data about virus transmission — which comes from an Israeli study — has yet to be peer-reviewed, but it’s still a promising early sign. According to Bloomberg, Pfizer and BioNTech “are working on a real-world analysis of data from Israel, which will be shared as soon as it’s complete.”

As vaccinations pick up, case numbers in the US are also falling dramatically. As the Atlantic’s James Hamblin points out, that could bode well for the summer.

If vaccination rates continue to rise and case numbers continue to fall, “it would mean that many aspects of pre-pandemic life will return even before summer is upon us,” Hamblin wrote Friday. “Because case numbers guide local policies, much of the country could soon have reason to lift many or even most restrictions on distancing, gathering, and masking. Pre-pandemic norms could return to schools, churches, and restaurants. Sports, theater, and cultural events could resume. People could travel and dance indoors and hug grandparents, their own or others’.”

Still, top public health officials are preaching caution as things begin to look up in the US, particularly as Covid-19 variants continue to spread in the country.

Last Sunday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned that a more infectious — and possibly more deadly — coronavirus variant first seen in the UK could become “the dominant strain by the end of March.”

“Now more than ever, with continued spread of variants that stand to threaten the progress we are making, we must recommit to doing our part to protect one another,” Walensky said at a press conference Friday. “Wear a well-fitting mask, social distance, avoid travel and crowds, practice good hand hygiene, and get vaccinated when the vaccine is available to you.”

And mask-wearing will likely be necessary for some time yet. Fauci told CNN on Sunday that Americans may still need to wear masks in 2022, and noted on Fox News Sunday that it could take until next year for children, particularly young children, to be vaccinated.",voxdotcom,"['half', 'deaths', 'according', 'covid19', 'case', 'vaccine', 'surpassed', 'million', 'fauci', 'cases', 'death', 'doses']",0
2021-02-21 20:35:58+00:00,13,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-21 16:46:09+00:00,33,"February 6 marks the anniversary of the first American death from the coronavirus.

Since then, well over 400,000 Americans have died from complications related to Covid-19. It’s likely many more will die before we’re finally over the hump. It goes without saying that no matter who was in charge last year, this pandemic would have killed lots of people. But it’s also true that bad leadership costs many lives, and we’ll never know for sure how many could have been spared.

The story of America’s failure is long and complicated. When the full history is finally written, the depth of those failures will likely shock even those of us who have followed it closely in real time.

For now, the closest thing we have to a comprehensive account of America’s botched response to the coronavirus is Lawrence Wright’s sweeping story in the New Yorker. Published in December, just a few days before the year ended, the story documents what happened and when, and who was responsible — a staggering piece of reporting that goes as deep as anything written thus far.

Wright highlights three moments at which America could’ve have gotten things right but, for various reasons, didn’t. It’s as depressing as it is illuminating. I reached out to Wright, who also wrote The End of October, a 2020 novel about a pandemic originating in Asia (seriously), to talk about those three pivotal moments.

Beyond diagnosing what went wrong, I asked Wright what the federal government could have done differently and if he thinks a competent administration with a serious plan might’ve saved hundreds of thousands of lives. He explained what happened in exquisite detail, and I have to say, it’s maddening. This was indeed a tragedy and, as Wright suggests, one of the greatest failures in the history of American governance.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You say there are three moments in which America’s Covid-19 response might have gone in a very different direction. Walk me through the first moment, in which China basically attempts to hide the scale of the pandemic in those early days.

Lawrence Wright

Right, the first moment occurs when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke to George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 3, 2020. This was already a fraught moment. Gao had really just started to discover the scale of the thing, and part of the dilemma was that in China people are afraid to report things up the chain. He was basically reading about what was happening on social media.

The tragic part about this moment is that Gao could not invite the American CDC team to come to China and help investigate the outbreak, and that set us back enormously. Redfield is sure that, had the CDC team been able to visit China at that point, we would’ve discovered that there was asymptomatic transmission, something we didn’t know at that point. This was already something that was being talked about in medical circles in China. It wouldn’t have been a secret. But the US, and really the rest of the world, did not figure this out until late February or early March. And had they known that, the strategy for dealing with this outbreak would have been entirely different.

“This was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad”

Sean Illing

Can the CDC be faulted for this, or is there little they could’ve done in the face of China’s intransigence?

Lawrence Wright

No, the CDC alone could not have done much. But the American government could have made it a much bigger issue, and we simply didn’t do it. People sat back and took the Chinese at their word. And look, China’s behavior at the beginning of this outbreak is nefarious. But the countries that knew China well — for instance, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan — they took precautions because they didn’t believe the Chinese assurances. And unfortunately, we didn’t do that. That was the first setback in our response and what I’d call strike one.

Sean Illing

Did you get any good answers as to why we sat back? It can’t be as simple as naiveté, can it? Or was the US government just scared to death of antagonizing China?

Lawrence Wright

All of those things were at play. There was absolutely a fear of antagonizing China. A great example of that is that we wanted to get our diplomats and businesspeople out of Wuhan, and China threw a fit. There was a “How dare you!” quality to their reaction. And in order to placate the Chinese, we sent these 747s over that we were going to use to pick up our citizens, and we stuffed it full of PPE gear, something like 18 tons of it. And we did it purely to mollify the Chinese.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the second moment.

Lawrence Wright

The second one was the fumble on the testing. The fault lies principally with CDC. But also, the FDA plays a role in this tragedy. The CDC was always the gold standard for public health agencies around the world. And one of the things they do is, they create tests for diseases. And they’ve been very good at that in the past. And of course, they were under terrific pressure in this moment and that in turn led to them taking some shortcuts.

So there are typically two main elements in a normal test kit, or two parts to the test. One is the primers and probes, as they call them, which detect the presence of viral antibodies. And the other is a piece of RNA that represents the virus. And these two things go together to make a test kit. Normally, you have them manufactured in separate facilities because it contaminates if you have them both in the same house. So the CDC took a shortcut. And they sent out the test kits knowing that it failed their own internal quality check. The fail rate was around 30 percent. But they sent out the kits anyway and they were totally unreliable.

Sean Illing

Wait, how the hell does that happen?

Lawrence Wright

The CDC didn’t know if it was a design problem or a manufacturing problem. They couldn’t figure it out. So the FDA sent this guy, Timothy Stenzel, down to Atlanta, the CDC headquarters. And it was immediately apparent what had happened. The lab was contaminated. They were processing samples of the test in the same room where they were making the test. So live virus samples were in the same room. And a mistake like that, you just can’t imagine the Centers for Disease Control doing that.

But there was another thing going on. There were three elements in the primers and probes, numbered one, two, and three. Numbers one and two detected against the SARS-CoV-2 and number three detected any coronavirus, in case it mutated. That was the element that failed. The test worked, except for that third element. All they had to do was to eliminate that third element and you would have a valid test. And the FDA refused to bend on this authorization, for weeks. We lost all of February because of the incompetence and inertia on the part of the CDC and FDA.

Sean Illing

You say we “lost all of February,” but what does that mean exactly? Can we even begin to speculate how many lives this dithering and incompetence cost?

Lawrence Wright

Well, there are models that show, at every step along the way, had the Chinese been more forthcoming earlier, had the Chinese shut down Wuhan earlier, had we gotten the test out sooner, it would have made an enormous difference in terms of the spread of the virus and the number of lives lost. We can’t say for sure, but had these things gone differently, we would be dealing with a fraction of what we’re facing now.

“More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured”

Sean Illing

Did anyone at the CDC or the FDA explain to you why in the world they sent out test kits knowing they were faulty?

Lawrence Wright

I asked Redfield about it and he said someone violated protocol. And that’s about it. They have an internal examination. No one’s really been held accountable. No one’s been fired. No one’s been fingered. But it’s pretty clear that it happened in the lab of Stephen Lindstrom, who was overseeing the test. And so far, there’s been no accountability for the failure in CDC.

I have to say that there’s been no real accountability at the FDA either. Because the FDA could have been responsive to the fact that the test obviously worked if you removed this third element. And they eventually did get it right, but they could have done it weeks earlier and, as I said, the consequences of this delay were enormous.

Sean Illing

There’s a crucial moment, on January 23, when a physician (Dr. Rick Bright) from HHS (Health and Human Services) tells various Trump officials, including Secretary Alex Azar, that the “virus might already be here,” and you write that the Trump people “seemed determined to ignore” the news. Does that mean they literally ignored it or does it mean they kept searching for “experts” to tell them what they wanted to hear?

Lawrence Wright

Both of those things were going on. They didn’t want to hear the news. They didn’t want to hear any bad news. But also there was this longing for someone to come along and say, “This is not a problem. It’s going away. And if you do nothing, we’ll be fine.” And Scott Atlas served that purpose.

Sean Illing

Wait, who is Scott Atlas?

Lawrence Wright

Scott Atlas is a neuroradiologist from Stanford who had been on Fox News a lot, saying that we needed to open up the schools, which is a legitimate debate. But he was advocating for “herd immunity,” which is this idea that when enough people have been either vaccinated or infected, the population at large is no longer susceptible to the spread of the disease. The main concept of herd immunity is, let people get sick. We don’t have the vaccine yet. If people get sick, then that will begin to choke off the spread.

The great appeal for the Trump administration was that you can achieve herd immunity by doing nothing. And that became the unspoken policy.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the third moment.

Lawrence Wright

This is, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all. Because in strike one and strike two, the rate of infection in the United States was still seemingly small. We didn’t have the tests, so we didn’t really know. But the sense of threat wasn’t as great. But when March rolls in and then you have New York City going into this horrible first wave, and the danger we’re facing is clear.

And all through February and March, Matt Pottinger, the deputy NSC (National Security Council) adviser, had been advocating for masks. And he was the only one in the White House who wore one. Finally in, I think it was April 3, the CDC swung around and recommended mask wearing in public after initially saying masks weren’t necessary.

If you look back at public health statements about masks, Dr. Fauci said that it wasn’t important for Americans to be wearing masks. And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad. If we had only done as good a job as Vietnam or South Korea, we could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of American lives. And we were supposed to be the country best equipped to deal with the pandemic. We had better resources than any country on earth. And that just makes the failure all the more catastrophic because we could have done a good job. And we did the worst job in the world.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'response', 'lawrence', 'covid19', 'cdc', 'botched', 'job', 'americas', 'masks', 'things', 'failure', 'going', 'say', 'world', 'didnt', 'worst', 'test', 'moment', 'wright']",0
2021-02-21 15:25:35+00:00,10,"This week, Saturday Night Live’s cold open took aim at Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for his trip to Cancun, Mexico, while millions of Cruz’s constituents were without power or water in freezing conditions after a winter storm struck Texas.

A shamefaced Cruz, played by Aidy Bryant, joined Chloe Fineman’s Britney Spears on a talk show called Oops, You Did It Again to apologize for the trip, which spiraled into a full-fledged scandal after the senator was photographed at the airport on Wednesday.

“I’m not tan,” a cornrowed, drink-toting Bryant tells Fineman as she takes a seat onstage with a suitcase in tow. “I just cried myself red over my fellow Texans. And that’s why I drink in their honor.”

The show also spoofed Cruz’s attempt to explain the trip Thursday by releasing a statement blaming his daughters, who he said “asked to take a trip with friends.” (Texts from Cruz’s wife, Heidi, obtained by the New York Times, cast some doubt on that story.)

“Let me ask you this,” Bryant says in the skit. “Would a coward have the cojones to blame his actions on his young daughters?”

Fineman’s Spears, understandably, doesn’t take that explanation well: “As someone who was often blamed for other people’s problems at a young age, maybe leave your daughters out of it because it could really mess with their heads,” Fineman says.

Spears has been in the spotlight this month after the release of the Framing Britney Spears documentary, which examines Spears’s personal struggles, her conservatorship, and the #FreeBritney movement.

Those struggles are referenced throughout the skit: The fictional talk show is sponsored by the Notes app, a reference to the apology posted by Spears’s former partner Justin Timberlake earlier this month, and at another point, Fineman stares intently at the screen while a #FreeBritney hashtag flashes on screen for a single frame.

“Are you looking to post a lame apology 20 years late?” Fineman asks in the ad. “Go through the motions with the Notes app.”

Joining Bryant, the next guest on a talk show apology tour is Pete Davidson’s scandal-plagued New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Cuomo has recently come under fire for miscounting Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and threatening to “destroy” a New York assemblyman, among other things, and it takes some prompting from Fineman before a reticent Davidson mutters an apology.

After another question by Fineman, Davidson’s Cuomo then quickly launches into an attack on New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has called for a Justice Department investigation into Cuomo’s pandemic response.

“What did that bird bitch say about me?” Davidson rages. “I will bury him in the tallest grave this city has ever seen. I will hire a hobo to Rick Moranis him so hard he’ll think he’s back in universal pre-K.” (Moranis was punched by someone walking past him on the sidewalk in New York last year.)

Bryant also attempts to sympathize with Davidson, only to be shot down.

“Do not associate yourself with me,” Davidson tells Bryant. “We are not the same. I am a man, you are a clown. And if you mess with me, I will send you to a clown hospital. And when you die, I will not count your body.”

“Nor should you, thank you,” Bryant responds.

The show’s last guest is an indignant Cecily Strong as former The Mandalorian actor Gina Carano, who prompts Fineman to “explain what I did wrong.”

Carano was fired from the show earlier this month for transphobic and anti-Semitic social media posts, including one that compared the experience of “being conservative at this moment in time to being a Jewish person during the Holocaust,” writes Vox’s Emily VanDerWerff.

“Look, I never would have made that Nazi comparison if I had known everyone was going to be such a Nazi about it,” Strong says.

After one last attempt by Bryant’s Cruz to find someone to sympathize with — Strong shoots Cruz down as “a pile of soup ... if you compare yourself with me, I will blast you to the farthest deserts of Tatooine” — Fineman offers a prayer to close the talk show.

“I pray that all of you be sane and well,” she says, “and to be with people who make you feel loved. ... And live from New York, it’s Saturday night!”",voxdotcom,"['trip', 'talk', 'york', 'cuomos', 'ted', 'freebritney', 'spears', 'tackles', 'davidson', 'scandals', 'cruz', 'fineman', 'strong', 'open', 'cold', 'bryant', 'month', 'snl', 'saga']",0
2021-02-21 13:55:45+00:00,62,"When the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, it may have seemed like a distant threat. But very quickly, the tiny pathogen made its way around the world, bringing sickness and death wherever it went. In America, the first known Covid-19 fatality occurred on February 6, 2020. From there, the wave of daily deaths started rising. By the end of May 2020, the virus had taken 100,000 lives, mostly in the Northeast and major cities. Four months later, the death toll surpassed 200,000. Less than three months later, by mid-December, more than 300,000 people had died. With the virus spreading all over the US, it took only 36 more days to reach 400,000 deaths. January was the deadliest month so far.

Who has died from Covid-19 in the US? The virus was unsparing.

Across the country, more than 28 million people have contracted the coronavirus, and over 500,000 have died. That’s the highest Covid-19 toll of any country and more than the coronavirus deaths in Italy, Germany, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, and France combined. It exceeds the US death toll in World War II. It’s also an underestimate, and doesn’t account for all the people impacted by loss. If every American who died has left nine people grieving, as one study suggested, there are now more than 4 million Americans who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. Death at this scale is difficult to comprehend, or visualize. To get a clearer sense of the shifting burden of Covid-19 deaths over time, Vox analyzed coronavirus mortality by age, region, and race from the past year, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. We found that while Covid-19 spared no group, it impacted certain populations more than others. Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus. They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black. But what started as a health emergency concentrated in travelers, urban minority communities, and other crowded places (such as nursing homes and prisons) fanned out into rural areas of the country, leading to a surge in deaths among white people, too. In the deaths, we saw how an “infectious disease became a universal issue,” said Boston University School of Public Health dean Sandro Galea. The extraordinary loss of life was also preventable, said Virginia Commonwealth University’s Steven Woolf, and a grim marker of “how poorly the US handled the pandemic.” By the winter of 2020, the virus was spreading broadly in every state, and largely by people younger than 50. Still, disparities in lives lost have persisted.

A trend at the start of the US outbreak has held: People of color have died of Covid-19 at much higher rates — double the rate of white people overall in 2020. But over the course of the year, the share of Covid-19 deaths among white people grew, while the share among Black and Hispanic people decreased.

In absolute terms, the death rate among white people rose significantly, while the rate among people of color dropped slightly. This was a trend we found in communities across America as Covid-19 spread. Deaths shifted from diverse counties to those with a higher share of white people

Experts attribute the change to the evolving geography of the virus — a result of the failure by states and the federal government to curtail transmission. At the start of the US outbreak, coronavirus cases — and deaths — were concentrated in a few cities, which have large numbers of people of color who are more likely to do essential work. “The impact of Covid-19 was limited to New York, and to a lesser extent Detroit and New Orleans,” said Dartmouth health economist Jonathan Skinner, “and in particular among people who had to commute by public transportation to service-sector jobs.” Many Black and Hispanic people soon contracted the virus and died at very high rates — an estimated 118,000 in 2020 overall. By October, some of the most sparsely populated areas of the country — Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska — were grappling with America’s worst outbreaks. The relative share of deaths among white people started rising. “The politics of 2020 led governors in [these] parts of the country to be less aggressive in dealing with the virus or actively discourage public health safeguards,” Woolf said. At the same time, more states adopted face-mask orders and other safety measures. Mask mandates helped bring case numbers down, and may have saved the lives of some essential workers. The result: In August, Black people died at 2.5 times the rate of white people. By November, the rate was 2.2. In early February, it was 1.5. But minorities were disproportionately affected by the virus in every month of 2020. They were also much more likely to die young.

Your screen is too small to view this graphic Of people who died of Covid-19 between the ages of 35 and 44, nearly half were Hispanic and a quarter were Black. “We would have otherwise expected them to live decades,” said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health. Of people over age 85 who died of Covid-19, 80 percent were white. Of those who died between the ages of 35 and 44, only 20 percent were white.

The data also reveals that regardless of race or geography, there is one group that has consistently experienced an extraordinarily high risk of death: the elderly. Age remains the greatest predictor overall of who lives after infection with the coronavirus and who dies.

Nearly half of all 2020 Covid-19 deaths were of people age 80 or older. If you include people age 60 or older, the share of deaths reaches almost 90 percent. With confirmed cases, the picture looks very different: Younger people, ages 20 to 59, are somewhat overrepresented.

In March through May, people age 80 and older had the most confirmed cases per capita (although testing for much of this time was limited). By June, that burden shifted to younger people. The summer case surge in young people was followed by a winter uptick in elderly deaths

2021-02-21 12:57:37+00:00,7,"We’re seeing an increasingly clear picture of what the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package will look like — and passage of the bill is likely on the horizon quite soon.

The House of Representatives has drafted and passed its version of the budget reconciliation package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for those making up to $75,000 and $400 expanded weekly unemployment insurance benefits through August 29. It also contains a restaurant rescue fund, money for reopening schools, and Democrats’ long-sought-after funding for state and local governments, among other items. House Democrats included a $15 minimum wage provision in their version of the bill, but that’s a non-starter in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn’t fall within the parameters of reconciliation, and while Democrats spent some time exploring other options for including it in the bill, they’ve set it aside for now.

The biggest ticket items have been among the most contentious: Though there was some discussion of further targeting for stimulus checks, the House proposal winds up pretty close to Biden’s original plan. The $1,400 stimulus checks are for those making up to $75,000 a year, and the checks phase out at $100,000 yearly income (there has been quite a bit of back-and-forth over whether to aim them more precisely at lower-income people).

The expanded weekly unemployment benefits are currently set at $300 and expire on March 14; this bill expands them to $400 through August 29 and extends pandemic-related benefits for freelancers and contractors, along with extended state benefits, for the same period. That shaves one month off Biden’s proposal.

One thing this bill doesn’t include is automatic stabilizers, or tying unemployment benefits to the actual unemployment situation instead of picking a specific date for them to expire.

Several House committees had a hand in crafting portions of the bill before sending them off to the House Budget Committee, which packaged the whole thing together for passage in the early morning hours of Saturday, February 27. The Senate is expected to have its version of the bill prepared this week, and if and when that’s passed, it will be bounced back to the House for re-passage. The Senate has to keep in mind the rules governing what can be done through budget reconciliation. Aides say House and Senate committees have been in close communication on the legislation so that they don’t end up with a bunch of ping-ponging back and forth later, though some of that will likely be inevitable.

The clock is ticking, and Democrats have every intention of getting more stimulus passed before the unemployment insurance cliff appears on March 14.

What’s in the House’s reconciliation bill, so far

From the Education and Labor Committee

Money for school reopening and higher education: In line with Biden’s proposal, the bill calls for $130 billion toward school reopening, directing funds toward areas such as ventilation system upgrades, reduced class sizes, and personal protective equipment to help make schools safer, and ensures the money is directed toward public schools. Schools are required to put 20 percent of money toward learning loss, meaning efforts to make up for lost ground with students missing school. It also directs $40 billion in grants to higher education and requires institutions that receive funding to dedicate at least half of it to emergency financial aid grants for students. At for-profit higher education institutions, 100 percent of allocations have to go to student aid.

Funds for health care access: The bill provides subsidies for COBRA (continued health coverage when people lose their jobs) with a premium reduction of 85 percent through September, and puts in place provisions to improve subsidies for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Food assistance and resources for families and children: The House bill puts $5 billion more into an existing Pandemic-EBT program to help low-income families with food assistance during the school year and the summer as well as additional funds for WIC, which supports women and children. It also expands the age of eligibility for the Child and Adult Care Food Program at emergency homeless shelters for young adults, and puts millions of dollars toward programs meant to address child abuse and neglect and domestic violence. And it puts $4.5 billion into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families cover the costs of heating and cooling their homes.

The bill invests $1.4 billion in programs for older adults under the Older Americans Act, including nutrition programs, support services, and disease prevention programs. A $15 minimum wage: The bill seeks to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will increase wages for 27 million workers (some Democrats say it will raise wages for 32 million workers). There’s some debate as to whether this provision can be done through reconciliation. The bill also puts $150 million toward the Department of Labor for the implementation of Covid-19-related worker protection programs. While this was in the House-passed bill, it’s a non-starter in the Senate, because the parliamentarian determined it cannot be passed through budget reconciliation.

Transportation and Infrastructure

Disaster relief: The bill has in it $50 billion for reimbursing state, local, tribal, and territorial governments for their Covid-19 response expenses, including vaccinations, PPE, National Guard deployment, and disinfecting public facilities.

Public transit and transportation: The bill directs $30 billion to public transit, which nationally has seen a huge drop in ridership during the pandemic: $8 billion to airports, $3 billion to aerospace manufacturing for temporary payroll support, and $1.5 billion to Amtrak for payrolls and restoring daily long-distance service. It also puts $3 billion toward the Economic Development Administration, which provides grants to economically distressed communities, meant to help respond to economic harm done by the pandemic.

Ways and Means

Unemployment insurance: The bill provides an additional $400 in weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government through August 29, 2021. (The supplement is currently set at $300 and is set to expire on March 14.) It also extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program for the self-employed and contractors, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which tacks on extra weeks of state benefits, through August 29. This is one to watch — Biden proposed extending pandemic-related unemployment benefits through September. The bill also directs $2 billion to the Department of Labor to shore up unemployment systems.

It also includes $1,400 for child and adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults (adult dependents have been excluded from previous stimulus payments).

It also includes $1,400 for child and adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults (adult dependents have been excluded from previous stimulus payments). Tax credits: The bill expands the child tax credit to $3,000 per child up to age 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6 for 2021, and it modifies the child and dependent care tax credit so that families can claim up to half of their related care expenses. It also enhances the earned income tax credit for people without children, reducing the minimum age to claim the credit from 25 to 19 and nearly tripling the maximum credit from $543 to $1,402.

It also enhances the earned income tax credit for people without children, reducing the minimum age to claim the credit from 25 to 19 and nearly tripling the maximum credit from $543 to $1,402. Child care assistance programs: The bill increases funding for the Child Care Entitlement to States, which gives states funding for child care for low-income families, to over $3.5 billion per year and suspends the required state match on new funds for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.

Pensions: A top priority of Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-MA), this portion of the bill would bail out multi-employer pension plans, which are pensions created through an agreement between at least two employers and a union. Neal estimates that about 10 million Americans are participants in multi-employer pension plans, and more than 1 million of them are participating in plans that are running out of money.

Obamacare premium subsidies. The bill increases the Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for two years for low- and middle-income Americans, or those making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. That would make health care through the ACA marketplace more affordable in 2021 and 2022. The bill also adjusts subsidies for people who make more than 400 percent of the poverty level to make sure that nobody pays more than 8.5 percent of their income for coverage.

Small Business

Amendments to the Paycheck Protection Program: The bill expands eligibility for the PPP for small businesses to include nonprofits (with certain restrictions) and to online-only news publishers (also with certain restrictions — they can have more than one physical location but can’t have more than 500 employees per location). It also puts an additional $7.25 billion toward the PPP, increasing the program level to $813.7 billion from $806.4 billion.

The restaurant industry has been particularly hard hit in the pandemic — the National Restaurant Association estimates industry losses in 2020 to be $240 billion.

Energy and Commerce

Vaccines, testing, and tracing: The bill directs $46 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services to detect, diagnose, trace, and monitor Covid-19. It also provides $7.5 billion in funding for the CDC to promote, monitor, and track Covid-19 vaccines, $1 billion for the CDC to strengthen confidence in the vaccine, and $5.2 billion to HHS to support more vaccine research and manufacturing. And it puts $500 million toward helping the CDC track Covid-19 hot spots and $750 million toward its efforts to combat Covid-19 around the world.

Financial Services

Defense Production Act spending: The bill puts $10 billion toward spending under the Defense Production Act, which lets the federal government make requests to private industries in times of emergency. The funds would help the president increase production of certain materials — namely, those needed to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, including PPE, vaccines, and tests.

Rental assistance: Democrats are aiming to put $25 billion toward emergency assistance to renters. Namely, they would put $19 billion toward the Treasury Department for rental and utility assistance to be allocated to states, territories, counties, and cities, and an additional $5 billion toward emergency housing choice vouchers for people at risk of homelessness, domestic violence survivors, and human trafficking victims to help them get stable housing. The bill also aims to put money toward people living on USDA-subsidized properties and toward programs helping Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives with housing.

Some funds will be directed specifically toward minority-owned businesses, businesses owned by those who are economically disadvantaged, and tribal government programs.

Support for the airline industry: The bill directs $15 billion toward a payroll support program established under the CARES Act that was supposed to help airline workers. This was not in Biden’s plan.

Agriculture

Food supply chains and agriculture: The bill puts an additional $3.6 billion toward the USDA for buying and distributing food and agricultural commodities and making grants and loans to farmers. It also provides $500 million in grants for rural health care and farm loan assistance for disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including those who have historically been discriminated against by the USDA. And, it puts money toward US-led humanitarian food aid.

Funding for state veterans homes: State veterans homes are facilities that provide care for veterans, whether nursing homes, at-home help, or adult day care. The bill puts funding toward them in two ways: $500 million for the VA to send money to states to upgrade and enhance homes, and $250 million in one-time emergency payments to support facilities.

Other VA funding: The bill directs $100 million toward the VA’s supply chain modernization efforts, $10 million for the VA’s inspector general’s office to conduct oversight, and almost $400 million for retraining assistance for veterans who lost their jobs because of Covid-19. It also allows the VA to waive copays for veterans, which is already in place, through September 30.

Oversight

State, local, tribal, and territorial funding: The bill directs $350 billion total toward state, local, tribal, and territorial funding, split into 60 percent for states and 40 percent for localities. Nearly $200 billion would go to states and Washington, DC, with $25.5 billion equally divided and then an additional $169 billion divvied up according to the state’s share of unemployed workers. On the local government front, $130 billion would be divided between cities and counties. Of that amount, $65 billion would go to cities using a community development block grant formula, so that $45 billion would go to municipalities with populations of over 50,000 and nearly $10 billion would go to municipalities with populations of under 50,000. Then, $65 billion would go to counties based on populations. The bill directs $4.5 billion to territories and $20 billion to tribal governments.

State and local government funding has been a major sticking point for Republicans, and if Democrats are able to pass this through reconciliation, they can bypass GOP opposition.

Emergency leave for federal and postal workers: The bill directs $570 million in emergency paid leave for federal employees and postal workers.

Democrats are trying to go fast and go big

Democrats have a tight deadline for passing the bill in mind because they don’t want expanded unemployment insurance to dry up in mid-March. Former President Donald Trump waited until the very last minute to sign the $900 billion stimulus package into law in December, and that threw a wrench in benefits for many workers and screwed up the inner workings of unemployment administration in many states.

This time around, Democrats appear determined to get legislation done on time. In the Senate, that has entailed simultaneously dealing with Trump’s impeachment trial, which ended in acquittal on February 13, and getting Biden’s Cabinet nominees confirmed. In a press conference with Senate Democrats on February 9, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted they could get it all done. “The bottom line is simple: the Senate is moving full steam ahead on a bold plan to get this country out of the crisis, to speed vaccination distribution, provide a lifeline to small businesses, help schools reopen safely, save the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and other public employees and so much more,” he said.

While the White House initially said it wanted to get a bipartisan bill passed through regular order, it has become increasingly clear that it won’t be able to find 10 Senate Republicans to go along, and the reconciliation process is moving ahead. What’s more, Democrats and Biden, well aware that the federal response to the Great Recession in 2009 was insufficient, appear determined to act aggressively on the economy this time around — whether or not many Republicans are onboard.

The trick, especially in the Senate, will be ensuring Democrats can stick together going forward, whatever the path.

Correction, February 19: A previous version of this story misstated Democrats’ estimate for how many workers would have their earnings increased with a $15 minimum wage.

2021-02-20 16:52:17+00:00,11,"We’re seeing an increasingly clear picture of what the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package will look like — and passage of the bill is likely on the horizon quite soon.

The House of Representatives has drafted and passed its version of the budget reconciliation package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for those making up to $75,000 and $400 expanded weekly unemployment insurance benefits through August 29. It also contains a restaurant rescue fund, money for reopening schools, and Democrats’ long-sought-after funding for state and local governments, among other items. House Democrats included a $15 minimum wage provision in their version of the bill, but that’s a non-starter in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn’t fall within the parameters of reconciliation, and while Democrats spent some time exploring other options for including it in the bill, they’ve set it aside for now.

The biggest ticket items have been among the most contentious: Though there was some discussion of further targeting for stimulus checks, the House proposal winds up pretty close to Biden’s original plan. The $1,400 stimulus checks are for those making up to $75,000 a year, and the checks phase out at $100,000 yearly income (there has been quite a bit of back-and-forth over whether to aim them more precisely at lower-income people).

The expanded weekly unemployment benefits are currently set at $300 and expire on March 14; this bill expands them to $400 through August 29 and extends pandemic-related benefits for freelancers and contractors, along with extended state benefits, for the same period. That shaves one month off Biden’s proposal.

One thing this bill doesn’t include is automatic stabilizers, or tying unemployment benefits to the actual unemployment situation instead of picking a specific date for them to expire.

Several House committees had a hand in crafting portions of the bill before sending them off to the House Budget Committee, which packaged the whole thing together for passage in the early morning hours of Saturday, February 27. The Senate is expected to have its version of the bill prepared this week, and if and when that’s passed, it will be bounced back to the House for re-passage. The Senate has to keep in mind the rules governing what can be done through budget reconciliation. Aides say House and Senate committees have been in close communication on the legislation so that they don’t end up with a bunch of ping-ponging back and forth later, though some of that will likely be inevitable.

The clock is ticking, and Democrats have every intention of getting more stimulus passed before the unemployment insurance cliff appears on March 14.

What’s in the House’s reconciliation bill, so far

From the Education and Labor Committee

Money for school reopening and higher education: In line with Biden’s proposal, the bill calls for $130 billion toward school reopening, directing funds toward areas such as ventilation system upgrades, reduced class sizes, and personal protective equipment to help make schools safer, and ensures the money is directed toward public schools. Schools are required to put 20 percent of money toward learning loss, meaning efforts to make up for lost ground with students missing school. It also directs $40 billion in grants to higher education and requires institutions that receive funding to dedicate at least half of it to emergency financial aid grants for students. At for-profit higher education institutions, 100 percent of allocations have to go to student aid.

Funds for health care access: The bill provides subsidies for COBRA (continued health coverage when people lose their jobs) with a premium reduction of 85 percent through September, and puts in place provisions to improve subsidies for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Food assistance and resources for families and children: The House bill puts $5 billion more into an existing Pandemic-EBT program to help low-income families with food assistance during the school year and the summer as well as additional funds for WIC, which supports women and children. It also expands the age of eligibility for the Child and Adult Care Food Program at emergency homeless shelters for young adults, and puts millions of dollars toward programs meant to address child abuse and neglect and domestic violence. And it puts $4.5 billion into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families cover the costs of heating and cooling their homes.

The bill invests $1.4 billion in programs for older adults under the Older Americans Act, including nutrition programs, support services, and disease prevention programs. A $15 minimum wage: The bill seeks to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will increase wages for 27 million workers (some Democrats say it will raise wages for 32 million workers). There’s some debate as to whether this provision can be done through reconciliation. The bill also puts $150 million toward the Department of Labor for the implementation of Covid-19-related worker protection programs. While this was in the House-passed bill, it’s a non-starter in the Senate, because the parliamentarian determined it cannot be passed through budget reconciliation.

Transportation and Infrastructure

Disaster relief: The bill has in it $50 billion for reimbursing state, local, tribal, and territorial governments for their Covid-19 response expenses, including vaccinations, PPE, National Guard deployment, and disinfecting public facilities.

Public transit and transportation: The bill directs $30 billion to public transit, which nationally has seen a huge drop in ridership during the pandemic: $8 billion to airports, $3 billion to aerospace manufacturing for temporary payroll support, and $1.5 billion to Amtrak for payrolls and restoring daily long-distance service. It also puts $3 billion toward the Economic Development Administration, which provides grants to economically distressed communities, meant to help respond to economic harm done by the pandemic.

Ways and Means

Unemployment insurance: The bill provides an additional $400 in weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government through August 29, 2021. (The supplement is currently set at $300 and is set to expire on March 14.) It also extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program for the self-employed and contractors, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which tacks on extra weeks of state benefits, through August 29. This is one to watch — Biden proposed extending pandemic-related unemployment benefits through September. The bill also directs $2 billion to the Department of Labor to shore up unemployment systems.

It also includes $1,400 for child and adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults (adult dependents have been excluded from previous stimulus payments).

Tax credits: The bill expands the child tax credit to $3,000 per child up to age 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6 for 2021, and it modifies the child and dependent care tax credit so that families can claim up to half of their related care expenses. It also enhances the earned income tax credit for people without children, reducing the minimum age to claim the credit from 25 to 19 and nearly tripling the maximum credit from $543 to $1,402.

Child care assistance programs: The bill increases funding for the Child Care Entitlement to States, which gives states funding for child care for low-income families, to over $3.5 billion per year and suspends the required state match on new funds for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.

Pensions: A top priority of Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-MA), this portion of the bill would bail out multi-employer pension plans, which are pensions created through an agreement between at least two employers and a union. Neal estimates that about 10 million Americans are participants in multi-employer pension plans, and more than 1 million of them are participating in plans that are running out of money.

Obamacare premium subsidies. The bill increases the Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for two years for low- and middle-income Americans, or those making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. That would make health care through the ACA marketplace more affordable in 2021 and 2022. The bill also adjusts subsidies for people who make more than 400 percent of the poverty level to make sure that nobody pays more than 8.5 percent of their income for coverage.

Small Business

Amendments to the Paycheck Protection Program: The bill expands eligibility for the PPP for small businesses to include nonprofits (with certain restrictions) and to online-only news publishers (also with certain restrictions — they can have more than one physical location but can’t have more than 500 employees per location). It also puts an additional $7.25 billion toward the PPP, increasing the program level to $813.7 billion from $806.4 billion.

The restaurant industry has been particularly hard hit in the pandemic — the National Restaurant Association estimates industry losses in 2020 to be $240 billion.

Energy and Commerce

Vaccines, testing, and tracing: The bill directs $46 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services to detect, diagnose, trace, and monitor Covid-19. It also provides $7.5 billion in funding for the CDC to promote, monitor, and track Covid-19 vaccines, $1 billion for the CDC to strengthen confidence in the vaccine, and $5.2 billion to HHS to support more vaccine research and manufacturing. And it puts $500 million toward helping the CDC track Covid-19 hot spots and $750 million toward its efforts to combat Covid-19 around the world.

Financial Services

Defense Production Act spending: The bill puts $10 billion toward spending under the Defense Production Act, which lets the federal government make requests to private industries in times of emergency. The funds would help the president increase production of certain materials — namely, those needed to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, including PPE, vaccines, and tests.

Rental assistance: Democrats are aiming to put $25 billion toward emergency assistance to renters. Namely, they would put $19 billion toward the Treasury Department for rental and utility assistance to be allocated to states, territories, counties, and cities, and an additional $5 billion toward emergency housing choice vouchers for people at risk of homelessness, domestic violence survivors, and human trafficking victims to help them get stable housing. The bill also aims to put money toward people living on USDA-subsidized properties and toward programs helping Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives with housing.

2021-02-20 14:30:04+00:00,33,"We’ve reached half a million deaths from the coronavirus in the US. But most of these deaths — and the grueling medical ordeals leading up to them — have remained largely hidden from view. The majority of terminally ill Covid-19 patients typically spend their last days or weeks isolated in ICUs to keep the virus from spreading.

“Most of what I’m seeing is behind closed curtains, and the general public isn’t seeing this side of it,” says Todd Rice, a critical care and pulmonology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Even “families are only seeing a little bit of it,” he says. As a result, most of us have been “protected and sheltered from seeing the worst of this disease.”

So what have these 500,000 people endured as the infection took over and their bodies failed? The terrible details have been strikingly absent from most of our personal and national discussions about the virus. But if we have been thus far (perhaps somewhat willfully) blind to the excruciating ways Covid-19 takes lives, this milestone is an opportunity to open our eyes.

Four physicians, who collectively have cared for more than 100 dying Covid-19 patients over the past 11 months, shared with Vox what their patients have gone through physically and mentally as the virus killed them. Their experiences reveal the isolating and invasive realities of what it is typically like for someone to die from Covid-19.

Lungs “full of bees” and a “sense of impending doom”

The torture of Covid-19 can begin long before someone is sick enough to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.

Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, it hampers the intake of oxygen. People with worsening Covid-19 typically show up in the emergency room because they are having trouble breathing.

As their lungs deteriorate further, they have a harder and harder time getting enough oxygen with each breath, meaning they need to breathe faster and faster — up from an average of about 14 times per minute to 30 or 40. Such gasping can bring about a very real sense of panic.

Imagine trying to breathe through a very narrow straw, says Jess Mandel, chief of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine at UC San Diego Health. “You can do that for 15 to 20 seconds, but try doing it for two hours.” Or for days or weeks.

Patients struggling through low oxygen levels like this have told Kenneth Remy, an assistant professor of critical care medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, that it feels like a band across their chest or that their lungs are on fire. Or like a thousand bees stinging them inside their chest. Others might have thick secretions in their lungs that make it feel like they are trying to breathe through muck. Many people say it feels like they’re being smothered.

The ordeal is so taxing that many wish for death. “You hear the patients say, ‘I just want to die because this is so excruciating,’” Remy says. “That’s what this virus does.”

“I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy”

Others feel that death is coming no matter what they do. Rice notes that is much more so for his Covid-19 patients than others he has treated. There seems to be something about Covid-19, he says, “that makes people prone to having a feeling of, ‘I really believe I’m going to die.’”

Meilinh Thi, who specializes in critical care and pulmonology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, has witnessed the same thing. “A lot of patients, regardless of age, have this sense of impending doom,” Thi says. Many have told her outright they felt like they were going to die. Eerily, “Everyone who has told me that has passed away,” she says.

Isolated

The agony of being critically ill with Covid-19 isn’t just borne by the body but also by the mind. “It doesn’t only put your lungs on fire or give you a horrible headache or make you feel miserable or make you breathe really fast,” Remy says. “It also wreaks havoc on your mental state.”

For one, from the time anyone with Covid-19 is admitted to the hospital, they are essentially cut off from almost everything that is familiar. Most Covid-19 deaths have occurred in hospitals, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that some are also dying in long-term care facilities (about 10 percent) or at home (about 6 percent).

“A lot of patients have told me how isolating and how lonely it is,” Thi says. And many get depressed. It is also incredibly scary to reach that point of illness with a disease that we know has already killed so many people, she and others point out.

All of these challenges have a cumulative effect. “If you can understand being in the hospital for two, three weeks, continuously breathing that fast, not having good interactions with your family because they can’t come and visit you — it’s extremely anxiety-provoking. It’s scary,” Remy says.

Being in the ICU for any reason also vastly increases a person’s risk for delirium, a state of confusion that can result in agitation, fear, and anger. Medications used to sedate people or relieve pain (both common in Covid-19 treatment) are part of the reason for this risk, as are the constant monitoring and physical disturbances — and subsequent sleep disruption.

Being a Covid-19 patient increases this likelihood of disorientation even more. Some estimates put the rate of delirium among adult ICU Covid-19 patients at about 65 percent.

One reason for this extra risk is that the only people patients see are covered in head-to-toe PPE, often with only their eye area visible behind a shield or goggles, rendering them even more anonymous and unfamiliar. (ICU nurses have described working alongside the same people for decades and now not recognizing them due to all the protective gear.) “That for sure increases the risk of delirium,” Thi says.

As a Covid-19 patient, “You’re just devoid of human contact to a large degree,” Mandel says.

And that is no small thing. With loved ones relegated to video calls, personal connection through in-person visits — typically a mainstay during an intensive hospital stay — is gone.

“If your mom or dad or spouse was in the hospital and was very sick, you would be at their bedside holding their hand,” Remy says. With fatal Covid-19, your last meaningful contact with family, before your final hours, might be as you get admitted into the ER, days or weeks before.

Doctors often have to use many invasive procedures to try to save lives

Anyone unwell enough to be in the ICU for any reason will be hooked up to lots of machines. But people with severe Covid-19 face a particularly grueling and invasive experience.

When people can no longer breathe for themselves and still aren’t getting enough oxygen from external sources (like short nose tubes or a BiPap machine, like those some people wear for sleep apnea), the next step is usually putting them on a ventilator.

To do this, patients are put on IV-based sedation and pain medication so they can tolerate the procedure. A tube is inserted into the mouth and down the airway so the machine can pump air into the lungs. The tube can remain there for days or weeks, during which time that person will remain heavily sedated and unable to talk. (This sedation can also mask other problems that arise during their illness, such as major strokes.)

“The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around”

Those who have survived the ordeal often don’t even remember the day leading up to being put on ventilation, Thi says. “They say they really just lost that portion of their life.”

The ventilator itself is not without risks. For example, if the machine is set to deliver too much air, it can cause additional lung damage. And the breathing tube only tends to be safe to keep in place for about two to three weeks, Thi notes. After that, it can start to deteriorate. At that point, doctors might surgically insert a tube into the patient’s neck — a procedure known as a tracheostomy — to connect them to the ventilator.

For some, even mechanical ventilation can’t get them enough oxygen. These patients often get put on “heart-lung” machines, which pump blood out of the body, through a machine that oxygenates it, and back in. (These are also sometimes used for people who have suffered a heart attack, and are known to have numerous side effects, such as increased risk for strokes as well as for agitation and delirium.) This process requires two large catheters (long tubes) inserted into a major artery or vein, so the machine can effectively pump enough blood in and out of the body.

Flipping people onto their stomachs has also helped get more air into their systems. During this practice, called proning, the sick individual is typically put on a medication to paralyze them so they cannot move. (Medical staff also turn incapacitated patients in bed every couple of hours “to make sure their skin doesn’t break down,” Thi says.)

A significant proportion of people — somewhere between about 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 — who get very sick with Covid-19 also end up with kidney failure. To prevent this from killing them, they’re put on dialysis machines, which take blood out of the body and filter it before returning it to the body. This procedure can cause nausea, cramping, and chronic itching. Anyone getting dialysis will need two additional large catheters put into another major blood vessel.

But these aren’t all of the tubes critically ill Covid-19 patients need. ﻿They also have a central venous catheter to administer medication. This long tube usually gets inserted into a major vein in the clavicle or groin, then is pushed through the vein until it reaches the heart, where it will stay until that person recovers or dies. Another catheter, sometimes put in near the groin, will take the person’s blood for analysis.

Other catheters will be inserted into the urethra to drain urine (which is monitored closely) and the rectum to frequently evacuate their feces (which is especially important because Covid-19 often causes diarrhea). Additional IVs, such as for hydration and medications, will poke patients in smaller vessels as well. People this ill with Covid-19 will also have a tube put into their mouth or nose and down into their stomach, to deliver a nutritious slurry to prevent malnutrition.

On top of all of these tubes and needles, a number of other beeping and humming devices monitor a person’s vitals. Leads attached to the chest track heart function, and a pulse oximeter on the finger keeps tabs on oxygen saturation. A standard cuff monitors blood pressure, but people often get an additional catheter into yet another vessel to measure blood pressure from within that artery.

All of these incredibly invasive interventions have a goal of sustaining the body simply so that it can try to fight off the virus and heal. “The technology we have is very powerful in terms of keeping people alive but less powerful at turning things around,” Mandel says. “It’s always a race.”

But even all of these procedures — alongside treatments like dexamethasone and remdesivir — are not enough to save everyone with Covid-19. Some people decline to go through some or all of this, or at least to endure it indefinitely, but that does not guarantee a lack of suffering. And for those most unlucky 1.8 percent of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in the US, death will then be imminent.

The end

Once someone is sick enough with Covid-19 that they need a ventilator, their chance of survival is somewhere between 40 and 60 percent, notes Remy. “You flip a coin, and you may be one of those people who die,” he says.

Remy recalls one particularly difficult week during the fall surge when he cared for a number of people in their 40s and 50s who ultimately died. Most of them were obese but otherwise healthy when they caught Covid-19 by not wearing a mask.

“One of the[se] patients specifically told me before I put the breathing tube in, ‘Let everyone know that this is real, my lungs are on fire. It’s like there’s bees stinging me. I can’t breathe. Please let them know to wear a mask ... because I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.’”

Right after that patient died, Remy made a precautionary video that he posted on Twitter.

Please listen as this is dire. I don’t want to be the last person that looks in your frightened eyes. #MaskUp ⁦@DrKenRemy1⁩ ⁦@WUSTLmed⁩ pic.twitter.com/qwb4eERlfE — Kenneth E. Remy, MD, MHSc, FCCM (@DrKenRemy1) November 21, 2020

If a patient’s breathing deteriorates slowly, hospitals can often arrange a way for them to talk with family members before they get intubated. Because after the tube goes in, they might not be conscious or able to talk again before they die. Regardless, the last person they have conscious contact with is typically a member of the medical staff before they are heavily sedated to receive the ventilator tube. In essence, “It could be anybody,” Rice says.

Despite the strict isolation for Covid-19 patients, “We try to make sure patients don’t die alone,” Thi says. For those who quickly nosedive, there often isn’t time to bring in family. Those people die surrounded by medical staff, either receiving CPR or, if they had do not resuscitate orders, with staff standing by.

For those who fall toward death, family — in full PPE — are now typically allowed in (which wasn’t usually the case at the beginning of the pandemic). At that point, “We would proceed with comfort measures only,” Thi says. In this scenario, the dying person will be on heavy medication as the ventilator tube is removed. Even still, once it gets taken out, people often gasp or cough as the body fights for air before they die.

Despite the palliative care and the possibility for family to now be present for a person’s actual death, doctors describe Covid-19 as a uniquely terrible way to die. “Covid is just so different,” Thi says. “I don’t think anything could be comparable to it. ... I don’t wish it on my worst enemy.”

Remy agrees. After having cared for patients dying from infectious diseases all over the world, he says, “I don’t know a disease that wreaks such havoc on the body and on the mind.” Which is perhaps why his dying patient was pleading with him so desperately just before being intubated to tell people to wear their masks and take the virus seriously.

Because otherwise, it will continue to take thousands of lives this way each day in the US until we can get vaccines to almost everyone.

2021-02-20 00:16:49+00:00,14,"Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s been a lot of talk about going back to “normal.” And while going back to a pre-coronavirus era would be a tremendous improvement for everyone, there are reminders all around us that it also wouldn’t be good enough.

A clear example is America’s opioid epidemic. Before Covid-19, the US suffered a record 70,630 drug overdose deaths in 2019. That amounted to a 5 percent increase from 2018, and erased the entire drop in overdose deaths reported from 2017 to 2018.

Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the crisis further worsened in 2020 — with an estimated 86,000 overdose deaths over the 12 months ending with July 2020. Experts say that’s partly due to Covid-19: As much of society shut down, so did places that can help people struggling with drugs, and more people were thrust into isolated conditions that may have pushed them to drug use and addiction.

But as the increase in overdose deaths from 2018 to 2019 shows, the crisis was once again on an upward trajectory before Covid-19. There are many possible reasons. But most notably, the highly potent synthetic opioid fentanyl has continued to supplant heroin in illicit markets, and with its greater potency, fentanyl brings a greater risk of overdose and death. Couple that with America’s inadequate addiction treatment system — which is very expensive and frequently offers substandard care — and you get an uncontrolled, worsening public health crisis.

One thing I really want to emphasize: this isn’t because, as I often hear from readers, the opioid crisis is an impossible problem to solve. A solution isn’t easy — addiction is a complex medical condition, for one — but it’s not impossible.

For opioids, there are very effective treatments: medications like methadone and buprenorphine (commonly known as Suboxone). These medications have decades of evidence behind them, showing they reduce all-cause mortality among opioid addiction patients by half or more and do a better job keeping people in treatment than non-medication approaches. In France, an expansion of access to buprenorphine in particular was tied to a big drop in overdoses.

Yet the majority of addiction treatment facilities don’t offer any of the federally approved medications. Many of these facilities are instead built around approaches that have little to no evidence behind them — or, in the case of some, actually have evidence against them.

Policymakers could address this. They could boost support for addiction treatment facilities but tie that support to truly evidence-based care, as Vermont has done. They could integrate addiction treatment into the health care system, therefore tying treatment to more accountability and higher quality standards — as Virginia has moved toward through its Medicaid program.

The problem, though, is that policymakers across the country by and large haven’t taken the crisis seriously enough. They haven’t spent the money; even as the crisis became a truly national story during the Trump administration, Republicans resisted spending much. Many lawmakers still hold stigmatizing views of those suffering from drug addiction, fostering apathy toward the problem.

In other words, we know this crisis is happening, we know there are policy solutions to address it, and yet we haven’t. This was true before Covid-19, and it’ll be true after, too.

This is just one example. From gun violence to the racial wealth gap to climate change, there are many problems that were going largely unaddressed in the “normal” pre-Covid times.

The good news, with opioids, is that President Biden has a good plan to address the crisis — it was one of his few plans, in fact, that was actually more ambitious than the rest of the Democratic primary field.

But to get action on the opioid epidemic and other issues, the American public and lawmakers can’t settle for “normal” — we’ll have to go bigger than that.

2021-02-19 21:02:39+00:00,29,"We’re seeing an increasingly clear picture of what the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package will look like — and passage of the bill is likely on the horizon quite soon.

The House of Representatives has drafted and passed its version of the budget reconciliation package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for those making up to $75,000 and $400 expanded weekly unemployment insurance benefits through August 29. It also contains a restaurant rescue fund, money for reopening schools, and Democrats’ long-sought-after funding for state and local governments, among other items. House Democrats included a $15 minimum wage provision in their version of the bill, but that’s a non-starter in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn’t fall within the parameters of reconciliation, and while Democrats spent some time exploring other options for including it in the bill, they’ve set it aside for now.

The biggest ticket items have been among the most contentious: Though there was some discussion of further targeting for stimulus checks, the House proposal winds up pretty close to Biden’s original plan. The $1,400 stimulus checks are for those making up to $75,000 a year, and the checks phase out at $100,000 yearly income (there has been quite a bit of back-and-forth over whether to aim them more precisely at lower-income people).

The expanded weekly unemployment benefits are currently set at $300 and expire on March 14; this bill expands them to $400 through August 29 and extends pandemic-related benefits for freelancers and contractors, along with extended state benefits, for the same period. That shaves one month off Biden’s proposal.

One thing this bill doesn’t include is automatic stabilizers, or tying unemployment benefits to the actual unemployment situation instead of picking a specific date for them to expire.

Several House committees had a hand in crafting portions of the bill before sending them off to the House Budget Committee, which packaged the whole thing together for passage in the early morning hours of Saturday, February 27. The Senate is expected to have its version of the bill prepared this week, and if and when that’s passed, it will be bounced back to the House for re-passage. The Senate has to keep in mind the rules governing what can be done through budget reconciliation. Aides say House and Senate committees have been in close communication on the legislation so that they don’t end up with a bunch of ping-ponging back and forth later, though some of that will likely be inevitable.

The clock is ticking, and Democrats have every intention of getting more stimulus passed before the unemployment insurance cliff appears on March 14.

What’s in the House’s reconciliation bill, so far

From the Education and Labor Committee

Money for school reopening and higher education: In line with Biden’s proposal, the bill calls for $130 billion toward school reopening, directing funds toward areas such as ventilation system upgrades, reduced class sizes, and personal protective equipment to help make schools safer, and ensures the money is directed toward public schools. Schools are required to put 20 percent of money toward learning loss, meaning efforts to make up for lost ground with students missing school. It also directs $40 billion in grants to higher education and requires institutions that receive funding to dedicate at least half of it to emergency financial aid grants for students. At for-profit higher education institutions, 100 percent of allocations have to go to student aid.

Funds for health care access: The bill provides subsidies for COBRA (continued health coverage when people lose their jobs) with a premium reduction of 85 percent through September, and puts in place provisions to improve subsidies for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Food assistance and resources for families and children: The House bill puts $5 billion more into an existing Pandemic-EBT program to help low-income families with food assistance during the school year and the summer as well as additional funds for WIC, which supports women and children. It also expands the age of eligibility for the Child and Adult Care Food Program at emergency homeless shelters for young adults, and puts millions of dollars toward programs meant to address child abuse and neglect and domestic violence. And it puts $4.5 billion into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families cover the costs of heating and cooling their homes.

The bill invests $1.4 billion in programs for older adults under the Older Americans Act, including nutrition programs, support services, and disease prevention programs. A $15 minimum wage: The bill seeks to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will increase wages for 27 million workers (some Democrats say it will raise wages for 32 million workers). There’s some debate as to whether this provision can be done through reconciliation. The bill also puts $150 million toward the Department of Labor for the implementation of Covid-19-related worker protection programs. While this was in the House-passed bill, it’s a non-starter in the Senate, because the parliamentarian determined it cannot be passed through budget reconciliation.

Transportation and Infrastructure

Disaster relief: The bill has in it $50 billion for reimbursing state, local, tribal, and territorial governments for their Covid-19 response expenses, including vaccinations, PPE, National Guard deployment, and disinfecting public facilities.

Public transit and transportation: The bill directs $30 billion to public transit, which nationally has seen a huge drop in ridership during the pandemic: $8 billion to airports, $3 billion to aerospace manufacturing for temporary payroll support, and $1.5 billion to Amtrak for payrolls and restoring daily long-distance service. It also puts $3 billion toward the Economic Development Administration, which provides grants to economically distressed communities, meant to help respond to economic harm done by the pandemic.

Ways and Means

Unemployment insurance: The bill provides an additional $400 in weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government through August 29, 2021. (The supplement is currently set at $300 and is set to expire on March 14.) It also extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program for the self-employed and contractors, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which tacks on extra weeks of state benefits, through August 29. This is one to watch — Biden proposed extending pandemic-related unemployment benefits through September. The bill also directs $2 billion to the Department of Labor to shore up unemployment systems.

It also includes $1,400 for child and adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults (adult dependents have been excluded from previous stimulus payments).

It also includes $1,400 for child and adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults (adult dependents have been excluded from previous stimulus payments). Tax credits: The bill expands the child tax credit to $3,000 per child up to age 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6 for 2021, and it modifies the child and dependent care tax credit so that families can claim up to half of their related care expenses. It also enhances the earned income tax credit for people without children, reducing the minimum age to claim the credit from 25 to 19 and nearly tripling the maximum credit from $543 to $1,402.

It also enhances the earned income tax credit for people without children, reducing the minimum age to claim the credit from 25 to 19 and nearly tripling the maximum credit from $543 to $1,402. Child care assistance programs: The bill increases funding for the Child Care Entitlement to States, which gives states funding for child care for low-income families, to over $3.5 billion per year and suspends the required state match on new funds for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.

Pensions: A top priority of Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-MA), this portion of the bill would bail out multi-employer pension plans, which are pensions created through an agreement between at least two employers and a union. Neal estimates that about 10 million Americans are participants in multi-employer pension plans, and more than 1 million of them are participating in plans that are running out of money.

Obamacare premium subsidies. The bill increases the Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for two years for low- and middle-income Americans, or those making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. That would make health care through the ACA marketplace more affordable in 2021 and 2022. The bill also adjusts subsidies for people who make more than 400 percent of the poverty level to make sure that nobody pays more than 8.5 percent of their income for coverage.

Small Business

Amendments to the Paycheck Protection Program: The bill expands eligibility for the PPP for small businesses to include nonprofits (with certain restrictions) and to online-only news publishers (also with certain restrictions — they can have more than one physical location but can’t have more than 500 employees per location). It also puts an additional $7.25 billion toward the PPP, increasing the program level to $813.7 billion from $806.4 billion.

A restaurant revitalization fund: House Democrats are seeking to put $25 billion toward a new program at the Small Business Administration that would support restaurants, $5 billion of which will be set aside for businesses with under $500,000 in revenue in 2019. The restaurant industry has been particularly hard hit in the pandemic — the National Restaurant Association estimates industry losses in 2020 to be $240 billion.

Energy and Commerce

Vaccines, testing, and tracing: The bill directs $46 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services to detect, diagnose, trace, and monitor Covid-19. It also provides $7.5 billion in funding for the CDC to promote, monitor, and track Covid-19 vaccines, $1 billion for the CDC to strengthen confidence in the vaccine, and $5.2 billion to HHS to support more vaccine research and manufacturing. And it puts $500 million toward helping the CDC track Covid-19 hot spots and $750 million toward its efforts to combat Covid-19 around the world.

Financial Services

Defense Production Act spending: The bill puts $10 billion toward spending under the Defense Production Act, which lets the federal government make requests to private industries in times of emergency. The funds would help the president increase production of certain materials — namely, those needed to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, including PPE, vaccines, and tests.

Rental assistance: Democrats are aiming to put $25 billion toward emergency assistance to renters. Namely, they would put $19 billion toward the Treasury Department for rental and utility assistance to be allocated to states, territories, counties, and cities, and an additional $5 billion toward emergency housing choice vouchers for people at risk of homelessness, domestic violence survivors, and human trafficking victims to help them get stable housing. The bill also aims to put money toward people living on USDA-subsidized properties and toward programs helping Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives with housing.

Support for the airline industry: The bill directs $15 billion toward a payroll support program established under the CARES Act that was supposed to help airline workers. This was not in Biden’s plan.

Agriculture

Food supply chains and agriculture: The bill puts an additional $3.6 billion toward the USDA for buying and distributing food and agricultural commodities and making grants and loans to farmers. It also provides $500 million in grants for rural health care and farm loan assistance for disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including those who have historically been discriminated against by the USDA. And, it puts money toward US-led humanitarian food aid.

It also allows the VA to waive copays for veterans, which is already in place, through September 30.

Oversight

State, local, tribal, and territorial funding: The bill directs $350 billion total toward state, local, tribal, and territorial funding, split into 60 percent for states and 40 percent for localities. Nearly $200 billion would go to states and Washington, DC, with $25.5 billion equally divided and then an additional $169 billion divvied up according to the state’s share of unemployed workers. On the local government front, $130 billion would be divided between cities and counties. Of that amount, $65 billion would go to cities using a community development block grant formula, so that $45 billion would go to municipalities with populations of over 50,000 and nearly $10 billion would go to municipalities with populations of under 50,000. Then, $65 billion would go to counties based on populations. The bill directs $4.5 billion to territories and $20 billion to tribal governments.

State and local government funding has been a major sticking point for Republicans, and if Democrats are able to pass this through reconciliation, they can bypass GOP opposition.

Emergency leave for federal and postal workers: The bill directs $570 million in emergency paid leave for federal employees and postal workers.

Oversight money: The bill puts $117 million toward oversight entities — namely, the Government Accountability Office and the Pandemic Response and Accountability Committee — to oversee pandemic relief funds.

Democrats are trying to go fast and go big

Democrats have a tight deadline for passing the bill in mind because they don’t want expanded unemployment insurance to dry up in mid-March. Former President Donald Trump waited until the very last minute to sign the $900 billion stimulus package into law in December, and that threw a wrench in benefits for many workers and screwed up the inner workings of unemployment administration in many states.

This time around, Democrats appear determined to get legislation done on time. In the Senate, that has entailed simultaneously dealing with Trump’s impeachment trial, which ended in acquittal on February 13, and getting Biden’s Cabinet nominees confirmed. In a press conference with Senate Democrats on February 9, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted they could get it all done. “The bottom line is simple: the Senate is moving full steam ahead on a bold plan to get this country out of the crisis, to speed vaccination distribution, provide a lifeline to small businesses, help schools reopen safely, save the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and other public employees and so much more,” he said.

While the White House initially said it wanted to get a bipartisan bill passed through regular order, it has become increasingly clear that it won’t be able to find 10 Senate Republicans to go along, and the reconciliation process is moving ahead. What’s more, Democrats and Biden, well aware that the federal response to the Great Recession in 2009 was insufficient, appear determined to act aggressively on the economy this time around — whether or not many Republicans are onboard.

The trick, especially in the Senate, will be ensuring Democrats can stick together going forward, whatever the path.

Correction, February 19: A previous version of this story misstated Democrats’ estimate for how many workers would have their earnings increased with a $15 minimum wage.

2021-02-19 19:24:24+00:00,31,"February 6 marks the anniversary of the first American death from the coronavirus.

Since then, well over 400,000 Americans have died from complications related to Covid-19. It’s likely many more will die before we’re finally over the hump. It goes without saying that no matter who was in charge last year, this pandemic would have killed lots of people. But it’s also true that bad leadership costs many lives, and we’ll never know for sure how many could have been spared.

The story of America’s failure is long and complicated. When the full history is finally written, the depth of those failures will likely shock even those of us who have followed it closely in real time.

For now, the closest thing we have to a comprehensive account of America’s botched response to the coronavirus is Lawrence Wright’s sweeping story in the New Yorker. Published in December, just a few days before the year ended, the story documents what happened and when, and who was responsible — a staggering piece of reporting that goes as deep as anything written thus far.

Wright highlights three moments at which America could’ve have gotten things right but, for various reasons, didn’t. It’s as depressing as it is illuminating. I reached out to Wright, who also wrote The End of October, a 2020 novel about a pandemic originating in Asia (seriously), to talk about those three pivotal moments.

Beyond diagnosing what went wrong, I asked Wright what the federal government could have done differently and if he thinks a competent administration with a serious plan might’ve saved hundreds of thousands of lives. He explained what happened in exquisite detail, and I have to say, it’s maddening. This was indeed a tragedy and, as Wright suggests, one of the greatest failures in the history of American governance.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You say there are three moments in which America’s Covid-19 response might have gone in a very different direction. Walk me through the first moment, in which China basically attempts to hide the scale of the pandemic in those early days.

Lawrence Wright

Right, the first moment occurs when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke to George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 3, 2020. This was already a fraught moment. Gao had really just started to discover the scale of the thing, and part of the dilemma was that in China people are afraid to report things up the chain. He was basically reading about what was happening on social media.

The tragic part about this moment is that Gao could not invite the American CDC team to come to China and help investigate the outbreak, and that set us back enormously. Redfield is sure that, had the CDC team been able to visit China at that point, we would’ve discovered that there was asymptomatic transmission, something we didn’t know at that point. This was already something that was being talked about in medical circles in China. It wouldn’t have been a secret. But the US, and really the rest of the world, did not figure this out until late February or early March. And had they known that, the strategy for dealing with this outbreak would have been entirely different.

“This was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad”

Sean Illing

Can the CDC be faulted for this, or is there little they could’ve done in the face of China’s intransigence?

Lawrence Wright

No, the CDC alone could not have done much. But the American government could have made it a much bigger issue, and we simply didn’t do it. People sat back and took the Chinese at their word. And look, China’s behavior at the beginning of this outbreak is nefarious. But the countries that knew China well — for instance, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan — they took precautions because they didn’t believe the Chinese assurances. And unfortunately, we didn’t do that. That was the first setback in our response and what I’d call strike one.

Sean Illing

Did you get any good answers as to why we sat back? It can’t be as simple as naiveté, can it? Or was the US government just scared to death of antagonizing China?

Lawrence Wright

All of those things were at play. There was absolutely a fear of antagonizing China. A great example of that is that we wanted to get our diplomats and businesspeople out of Wuhan, and China threw a fit. There was a “How dare you!” quality to their reaction. And in order to placate the Chinese, we sent these 747s over that we were going to use to pick up our citizens, and we stuffed it full of PPE gear, something like 18 tons of it. And we did it purely to mollify the Chinese.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the second moment.

Lawrence Wright

The second one was the fumble on the testing. The fault lies principally with CDC. But also, the FDA plays a role in this tragedy. The CDC was always the gold standard for public health agencies around the world. And one of the things they do is, they create tests for diseases. And they’ve been very good at that in the past. And of course, they were under terrific pressure in this moment and that in turn led to them taking some shortcuts.

So there are typically two main elements in a normal test kit, or two parts to the test. One is the primers and probes, as they call them, which detect the presence of viral antibodies. And the other is a piece of RNA that represents the virus. And these two things go together to make a test kit. Normally, you have them manufactured in separate facilities because it contaminates if you have them both in the same house. So the CDC took a shortcut. And they sent out the test kits knowing that it failed their own internal quality check. The fail rate was around 30 percent. But they sent out the kits anyway and they were totally unreliable.

Sean Illing

Wait, how the hell does that happen?

Lawrence Wright

The CDC didn’t know if it was a design problem or a manufacturing problem. They couldn’t figure it out. So the FDA sent this guy, Timothy Stenzel, down to Atlanta, the CDC headquarters. And it was immediately apparent what had happened. The lab was contaminated. They were processing samples of the test in the same room where they were making the test. So live virus samples were in the same room. And a mistake like that, you just can’t imagine the Centers for Disease Control doing that.

But there was another thing going on. There were three elements in the primers and probes, numbered one, two, and three. Numbers one and two detected against the SARS-CoV-2 and number three detected any coronavirus, in case it mutated. That was the element that failed. The test worked, except for that third element. All they had to do was to eliminate that third element and you would have a valid test. And the FDA refused to bend on this authorization, for weeks. We lost all of February because of the incompetence and inertia on the part of the CDC and FDA.

Sean Illing

You say we “lost all of February,” but what does that mean exactly? Can we even begin to speculate how many lives this dithering and incompetence cost?

Lawrence Wright

Well, there are models that show, at every step along the way, had the Chinese been more forthcoming earlier, had the Chinese shut down Wuhan earlier, had we gotten the test out sooner, it would have made an enormous difference in terms of the spread of the virus and the number of lives lost. We can’t say for sure, but had these things gone differently, we would be dealing with a fraction of what we’re facing now.

“More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured”

Sean Illing

Did anyone at the CDC or the FDA explain to you why in the world they sent out test kits knowing they were faulty?

Lawrence Wright

I asked Redfield about it and he said someone violated protocol. And that’s about it. They have an internal examination. No one’s really been held accountable. No one’s been fired. No one’s been fingered. But it’s pretty clear that it happened in the lab of Stephen Lindstrom, who was overseeing the test. And so far, there’s been no accountability for the failure in CDC.

I have to say that there’s been no real accountability at the FDA either. Because the FDA could have been responsive to the fact that the test obviously worked if you removed this third element. And they eventually did get it right, but they could have done it weeks earlier and, as I said, the consequences of this delay were enormous.

Sean Illing

There’s a crucial moment, on January 23, when a physician (Dr. Rick Bright) from HHS (Health and Human Services) tells various Trump officials, including Secretary Alex Azar, that the “virus might already be here,” and you write that the Trump people “seemed determined to ignore” the news. Does that mean they literally ignored it or does it mean they kept searching for “experts” to tell them what they wanted to hear?

Lawrence Wright

Both of those things were going on. They didn’t want to hear the news. They didn’t want to hear any bad news. But also there was this longing for someone to come along and say, “This is not a problem. It’s going away. And if you do nothing, we’ll be fine.” And Scott Atlas served that purpose.

Sean Illing

Wait, who is Scott Atlas?

Lawrence Wright

Scott Atlas is a neuroradiologist from Stanford who had been on Fox News a lot, saying that we needed to open up the schools, which is a legitimate debate. But he was advocating for “herd immunity,” which is this idea that when enough people have been either vaccinated or infected, the population at large is no longer susceptible to the spread of the disease. The main concept of herd immunity is, let people get sick. We don’t have the vaccine yet. If people get sick, then that will begin to choke off the spread.

The great appeal for the Trump administration was that you can achieve herd immunity by doing nothing. And that became the unspoken policy.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the third moment.

Lawrence Wright

This is, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all. Because in strike one and strike two, the rate of infection in the United States was still seemingly small. We didn’t have the tests, so we didn’t really know. But the sense of threat wasn’t as great. But when March rolls in and then you have New York City going into this horrible first wave, and the danger we’re facing is clear.

And all through February and March, Matt Pottinger, the deputy NSC (National Security Council) adviser, had been advocating for masks. And he was the only one in the White House who wore one. Finally in, I think it was April 3, the CDC swung around and recommended mask wearing in public after initially saying masks weren’t necessary.

If you look back at public health statements about masks, Dr. Fauci said that it wasn’t important for Americans to be wearing masks. And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad. If we had only done as good a job as Vietnam or South Korea, we could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of American lives. And we were supposed to be the country best equipped to deal with the pandemic. We had better resources than any country on earth. And that just makes the failure all the more catastrophic because we could have done a good job. And we did the worst job in the world.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'response', 'lawrence', 'covid19', 'cdc', 'botched', 'job', 'americas', 'masks', 'things', 'failure', 'going', 'say', 'world', 'didnt', 'worst', 'test', 'moment', 'wright']",0
2021-02-19 13:50:13+00:00,11,"We’re seeing an increasingly clear picture of what the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package will look like — and passage of the bill is likely on the horizon quite soon.

The House of Representatives has drafted and passed its version of the budget reconciliation package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for those making up to $75,000 and $400 expanded weekly unemployment insurance benefits through August 29. It also contains a restaurant rescue fund, money for reopening schools, and Democrats’ long-sought-after funding for state and local governments, among other items. House Democrats included a $15 minimum wage provision in their version of the bill, but that’s a non-starter in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn’t fall within the parameters of reconciliation, and while Democrats spent some time exploring other options for including it in the bill, they’ve set it aside for now.

The biggest ticket items have been among the most contentious: Though there was some discussion of further targeting for stimulus checks, the House proposal winds up pretty close to Biden’s original plan. The $1,400 stimulus checks are for those making up to $75,000 a year, and the checks phase out at $100,000 yearly income (there has been quite a bit of back-and-forth over whether to aim them more precisely at lower-income people).

The expanded weekly unemployment benefits are currently set at $300 and expire on March 14; this bill expands them to $400 through August 29 and extends pandemic-related benefits for freelancers and contractors, along with extended state benefits, for the same period. That shaves one month off Biden’s proposal.

One thing this bill doesn’t include is automatic stabilizers, or tying unemployment benefits to the actual unemployment situation instead of picking a specific date for them to expire.

Several House committees had a hand in crafting portions of the bill before sending them off to the House Budget Committee, which packaged the whole thing together for passage in the early morning hours of Saturday, February 27. The Senate is expected to have its version of the bill prepared this week, and if and when that’s passed, it will be bounced back to the House for re-passage. The Senate has to keep in mind the rules governing what can be done through budget reconciliation. Aides say House and Senate committees have been in close communication on the legislation so that they don’t end up with a bunch of ping-ponging back and forth later, though some of that will likely be inevitable.

The clock is ticking, and Democrats have every intention of getting more stimulus passed before the unemployment insurance cliff appears on March 14.

What’s in the House’s reconciliation bill, so far

From the Education and Labor Committee

Money for school reopening and higher education: In line with Biden’s proposal, the bill calls for $130 billion toward school reopening, directing funds toward areas such as ventilation system upgrades, reduced class sizes, and personal protective equipment to help make schools safer, and ensures the money is directed toward public schools. Schools are required to put 20 percent of money toward learning loss, meaning efforts to make up for lost ground with students missing school. It also directs $40 billion in grants to higher education and requires institutions that receive funding to dedicate at least half of it to emergency financial aid grants for students. At for-profit higher education institutions, 100 percent of allocations have to go to student aid.

Food assistance and resources for families and children: The House bill puts $5 billion more into an existing Pandemic-EBT program to help low-income families with food assistance during the school year and the summer as well as additional funds for WIC, which supports women and children. It also expands the age of eligibility for the Child and Adult Care Food Program at emergency homeless shelters for young adults, and puts millions of dollars toward programs meant to address child abuse and neglect and domestic violence. And it puts $4.5 billion into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families cover the costs of heating and cooling their homes.

The bill invests $1.4 billion in programs for older adults under the Older Americans Act, including nutrition programs, support services, and disease prevention programs. A $15 minimum wage: The bill seeks to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will increase wages for 27 million workers (some Democrats say it will raise wages for 32 million workers). There’s some debate as to whether this provision can be done through reconciliation. The bill also puts $150 million toward the Department of Labor for the implementation of Covid-19-related worker protection programs. While this was in the House-passed bill, it’s a non-starter in the Senate, because the parliamentarian determined it cannot be passed through budget reconciliation.

Transportation and Infrastructure

Disaster relief: The bill has in it $50 billion for reimbursing state, local, tribal, and territorial governments for their Covid-19 response expenses, including vaccinations, PPE, National Guard deployment, and disinfecting public facilities.

Public transit and transportation: The bill directs $30 billion to public transit, which nationally has seen a huge drop in ridership during the pandemic: $8 billion to airports, $3 billion to aerospace manufacturing for temporary payroll support, and $1.5 billion to Amtrak for payrolls and restoring daily long-distance service. It also puts $3 billion toward the Economic Development Administration, which provides grants to economically distressed communities, meant to help respond to economic harm done by the pandemic.

Ways and Means

Unemployment insurance: The bill provides an additional $400 in weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government through August 29, 2021. (The supplement is currently set at $300 and is set to expire on March 14.) It also extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program for the self-employed and contractors, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which tacks on extra weeks of state benefits, through August 29. This is one to watch — Biden proposed extending pandemic-related unemployment benefits through September. The bill also directs $2 billion to the Department of Labor to shore up unemployment systems.

That would make health care through the ACA marketplace more affordable in 2021 and 2022. The bill also adjusts subsidies for people who make more than 400 percent of the poverty level to make sure that nobody pays more than 8.5 percent of their income for coverage.

Small Business

Amendments to the Paycheck Protection Program: The bill expands eligibility for the PPP for small businesses to include nonprofits (with certain restrictions) and to online-only news publishers (also with certain restrictions — they can have more than one physical location but can’t have more than 500 employees per location). It also puts an additional $7.25 billion toward the PPP, increasing the program level to $813.7 billion from $806.4 billion.

The restaurant industry has been particularly hard hit in the pandemic — the National Restaurant Association estimates industry losses in 2020 to be $240 billion.

Energy and Commerce

Vaccines, testing, and tracing: The bill directs $46 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services to detect, diagnose, trace, and monitor Covid-19. It also provides $7.5 billion in funding for the CDC to promote, monitor, and track Covid-19 vaccines, $1 billion for the CDC to strengthen confidence in the vaccine, and $5.2 billion to HHS to support more vaccine research and manufacturing. And it puts $500 million toward helping the CDC track Covid-19 hot spots and $750 million toward its efforts to combat Covid-19 around the world.

Financial Services

Defense Production Act spending: The bill puts $10 billion toward spending under the Defense Production Act, which lets the federal government make requests to private industries in times of emergency. The funds would help the president increase production of certain materials — namely, those needed to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, including PPE, vaccines, and tests.

Rental assistance: Democrats are aiming to put $25 billion toward emergency assistance to renters. Namely, they would put $19 billion toward the Treasury Department for rental and utility assistance to be allocated to states, territories, counties, and cities, and an additional $5 billion toward emergency housing choice vouchers for people at risk of homelessness, domestic violence survivors, and human trafficking victims to help them get stable housing. The bill also aims to put money toward people living on USDA-subsidized properties and toward programs helping Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives with housing.

Support for the airline industry: The bill directs $15 billion toward a payroll support program established under the CARES Act that was supposed to help airline workers. This was not in Biden’s plan.

Agriculture

Food supply chains and agriculture: The bill puts an additional $3.6 billion toward the USDA for buying and distributing food and agricultural commodities and making grants and loans to farmers. It also provides $500 million in grants for rural health care and farm loan assistance for disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including those who have historically been discriminated against by the USDA. And, it puts money toward US-led humanitarian food aid.

Veterans Affairs

Claims and appeals funding: The bill directs $272 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs to try to reduce the effects of Covid-19 on benefits claims and appeals backlogs for vets.

Other VA funding: The bill directs $100 million toward the VA’s supply chain modernization efforts, $10 million for the VA’s inspector general’s office to conduct oversight, and almost $400 million for retraining assistance for veterans who lost their jobs because of Covid-19. It also allows the VA to waive copays for veterans, which is already in place, through September 30.

Oversight

State, local, tribal, and territorial funding: The bill directs $350 billion total toward state, local, tribal, and territorial funding, split into 60 percent for states and 40 percent for localities. Nearly $200 billion would go to states and Washington, DC, with $25.5 billion equally divided and then an additional $169 billion divvied up according to the state’s share of unemployed workers. On the local government front, $130 billion would be divided between cities and counties. Of that amount, $65 billion would go to cities using a community development block grant formula, so that $45 billion would go to municipalities with populations of over 50,000 and nearly $10 billion would go to municipalities with populations of under 50,000. Then, $65 billion would go to counties based on populations. The bill directs $4.5 billion to territories and $20 billion to tribal governments.

State and local government funding has been a major sticking point for Republicans, and if Democrats are able to pass this through reconciliation, they can bypass GOP opposition.

Emergency leave for federal and postal workers: The bill directs $570 million in emergency paid leave for federal employees and postal workers.

Oversight money: The bill puts $117 million toward oversight entities — namely, the Government Accountability Office and the Pandemic Response and Accountability Committee — to oversee pandemic relief funds.

Democrats are trying to go fast and go big

Democrats have a tight deadline for passing the bill in mind because they don’t want expanded unemployment insurance to dry up in mid-March. Former President Donald Trump waited until the very last minute to sign the $900 billion stimulus package into law in December, and that threw a wrench in benefits for many workers and screwed up the inner workings of unemployment administration in many states.

This time around, Democrats appear determined to get legislation done on time. In the Senate, that has entailed simultaneously dealing with Trump’s impeachment trial, which ended in acquittal on February 13, and getting Biden’s Cabinet nominees confirmed. In a press conference with Senate Democrats on February 9, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted they could get it all done. “The bottom line is simple: the Senate is moving full steam ahead on a bold plan to get this country out of the crisis, to speed vaccination distribution, provide a lifeline to small businesses, help schools reopen safely, save the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and other public employees and so much more,” he said.

While the White House initially said it wanted to get a bipartisan bill passed through regular order, it has become increasingly clear that it won’t be able to find 10 Senate Republicans to go along, and the reconciliation process is moving ahead. What’s more, Democrats and Biden, well aware that the federal response to the Great Recession in 2009 was insufficient, appear determined to act aggressively on the economy this time around — whether or not many Republicans are onboard.

The trick, especially in the Senate, will be ensuring Democrats can stick together going forward, whatever the path.

Correction, February 19: A previous version of this story misstated Democrats’ estimate for how many workers would have their earnings increased with a $15 minimum wage.

2021-02-19 04:51:03+00:00,21,"We’re seeing an increasingly clear picture of what the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package will look like — and passage of the bill is likely on the horizon quite soon.

The House of Representatives has drafted and passed its version of the budget reconciliation package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for those making up to $75,000 and $400 expanded weekly unemployment insurance benefits through August 29. It also contains a restaurant rescue fund, money for reopening schools, and Democrats’ long-sought-after funding for state and local governments, among other items. House Democrats included a $15 minimum wage provision in their version of the bill, but that’s a non-starter in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn’t fall within the parameters of reconciliation, and while Democrats spent some time exploring other options for including it in the bill, they’ve set it aside for now.

The biggest ticket items have been among the most contentious: Though there was some discussion of further targeting for stimulus checks, the House proposal winds up pretty close to Biden’s original plan. The $1,400 stimulus checks are for those making up to $75,000 a year, and the checks phase out at $100,000 yearly income (there has been quite a bit of back-and-forth over whether to aim them more precisely at lower-income people).

The expanded weekly unemployment benefits are currently set at $300 and expire on March 14; this bill expands them to $400 through August 29 and extends pandemic-related benefits for freelancers and contractors, along with extended state benefits, for the same period. That shaves one month off Biden’s proposal.

One thing this bill doesn’t include is automatic stabilizers, or tying unemployment benefits to the actual unemployment situation instead of picking a specific date for them to expire.

Several House committees had a hand in crafting portions of the bill before sending them off to the House Budget Committee, which packaged the whole thing together for passage in the early morning hours of Saturday, February 27. The Senate is expected to have its version of the bill prepared this week, and if and when that’s passed, it will be bounced back to the House for re-passage. The Senate has to keep in mind the rules governing what can be done through budget reconciliation. Aides say House and Senate committees have been in close communication on the legislation so that they don’t end up with a bunch of ping-ponging back and forth later, though some of that will likely be inevitable.

The clock is ticking, and Democrats have every intention of getting more stimulus passed before the unemployment insurance cliff appears on March 14.

What’s in the House’s reconciliation bill, so far

From the Education and Labor Committee

Money for school reopening and higher education: In line with Biden’s proposal, the bill calls for $130 billion toward school reopening, directing funds toward areas such as ventilation system upgrades, reduced class sizes, and personal protective equipment to help make schools safer, and ensures the money is directed toward public schools. Schools are required to put 20 percent of money toward learning loss, meaning efforts to make up for lost ground with students missing school. It also directs $40 billion in grants to higher education and requires institutions that receive funding to dedicate at least half of it to emergency financial aid grants for students. At for-profit higher education institutions, 100 percent of allocations have to go to student aid.

It also expands the age of eligibility for the Child and Adult Care Food Program at emergency homeless shelters for young adults, and puts millions of dollars toward programs meant to address child abuse and neglect and domestic violence. And it puts $4.5 billion into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families cover the costs of heating and cooling their homes.

A $15 minimum wage: The bill seeks to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will increase wages for 27 million workers (some Democrats say it will raise wages for 32 million workers). There’s some debate as to whether this provision can be done through reconciliation. The bill also puts $150 million toward the Department of Labor for the implementation of Covid-19-related worker protection programs.

Support for the airline industry: The bill directs $15 billion toward a payroll support program established under the CARES Act that was supposed to help airline workers. This was not in Biden’s plan.

Agriculture

Food supply chains and agriculture: The bill puts an additional $3.6 billion toward the USDA for buying and distributing food and agricultural commodities and making grants and loans to farmers. It also provides $500 million in grants for rural health care and farm loan assistance for disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including those who have historically been discriminated against by the USDA.

It also allows the VA to waive copays for veterans, which is already in place, through September 30.

Oversight

State, local, tribal, and territorial funding: The bill directs $350 billion total toward state, local, tribal, and territorial funding, split into 60 percent for states and 40 percent for localities. Nearly $200 billion would go to states and Washington, DC, with $25.5 billion equally divided and then an additional $169 billion divvied up according to the state’s share of unemployed workers. On the local government front, $130 billion would be divided between cities and counties. Of that amount, $65 billion would go to cities using a community development block grant formula, so that $45 billion would go to municipalities with populations of over 50,000 and nearly $10 billion would go to municipalities with populations of under 50,000. Then, $65 billion would go to counties based on populations. The bill directs $4.5 billion to territories and $20 billion to tribal governments.

State and local government funding has been a major sticking point for Republicans, and if Democrats are able to pass this through reconciliation, they can bypass GOP opposition.

Emergency leave for federal and postal workers: The bill directs $570 million in emergency paid leave for federal employees and postal workers.

Oversight money: The bill puts $117 million toward oversight entities — namely, the Government Accountability Office and the Pandemic Response and Accountability Committee — to oversee pandemic relief funds.

Democrats are trying to go fast and go big

Democrats have a tight deadline for passing the bill in mind because they don’t want expanded unemployment insurance to dry up in mid-March. Former President Donald Trump waited until the very last minute to sign the $900 billion stimulus package into law in December, and that threw a wrench in benefits for many workers and screwed up the inner workings of unemployment administration in many states.

This time around, Democrats appear determined to get legislation done on time. In the Senate, that has entailed simultaneously dealing with Trump’s impeachment trial, which ended in acquittal on February 13, and getting Biden’s Cabinet nominees confirmed. In a press conference with Senate Democrats on February 9, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted they could get it all done. “The bottom line is simple: the Senate is moving full steam ahead on a bold plan to get this country out of the crisis, to speed vaccination distribution, provide a lifeline to small businesses, help schools reopen safely, save the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and other public employees and so much more,” he said.

While the White House initially said it wanted to get a bipartisan bill passed through regular order, it has become increasingly clear that it won’t be able to find 10 Senate Republicans to go along, and the reconciliation process is moving ahead. What’s more, Democrats and Biden, well aware that the federal response to the Great Recession in 2009 was insufficient, appear determined to act aggressively on the economy this time around — whether or not many Republicans are onboard.

The trick, especially in the Senate, will be ensuring Democrats can stick together going forward, whatever the path.

Correction, February 19: A previous version of this story misstated Democrats’ estimate for how many workers would have their earnings increased with a $15 minimum wage.

2021-02-18 15:03:19+00:00,22,"When the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, it may have seemed like a distant threat. But very quickly, the tiny pathogen made its way around the world, bringing sickness and death wherever it went. In America, the first known Covid-19 fatality occurred on February 6, 2020. From there, the wave of daily deaths started rising. By the end of May 2020, the virus had taken 100,000 lives, mostly in the Northeast and major cities. Four months later, the death toll surpassed 200,000. Less than three months later, by mid-December, more than 300,000 people had died. With the virus spreading all over the US, it took only 36 more days to reach 400,000 deaths. January was the deadliest month so far.

Who has died from Covid-19 in the US? The virus was unsparing.

Across the country, more than 28 million people have contracted the coronavirus, and over 500,000 have died. That’s the highest Covid-19 toll of any country and more than the coronavirus deaths in Italy, Germany, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, and France combined. It exceeds the US death toll in World War II. It’s also an underestimate, and doesn’t account for all the people impacted by loss. If every American who died has left nine people grieving, as one study suggested, there are now more than 4 million Americans who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. Death at this scale is difficult to comprehend, or visualize. To get a clearer sense of the shifting burden of Covid-19 deaths over time, Vox analyzed coronavirus mortality by age, region, and race from the past year, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. We found that while Covid-19 spared no group, it impacted certain populations more than others. Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus. They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black. But what started as a health emergency concentrated in travelers, urban minority communities, and other crowded places (such as nursing homes and prisons) fanned out into rural areas of the country, leading to a surge in deaths among white people, too. In the deaths, we saw how an “infectious disease became a universal issue,” said Boston University School of Public Health dean Sandro Galea. The extraordinary loss of life was also preventable, said Virginia Commonwealth University’s Steven Woolf, and a grim marker of “how poorly the US handled the pandemic.” By the winter of 2020, the virus was spreading broadly in every state, and largely by people younger than 50. Still, disparities in lives lost have persisted.

A trend at the start of the US outbreak has held: People of color have died of Covid-19 at much higher rates — double the rate of white people overall in 2020. But over the course of the year, the share of Covid-19 deaths among white people grew, while the share among Black and Hispanic people decreased.

In absolute terms, the death rate among white people rose significantly, while the rate among people of color dropped slightly. This was a trend we found in communities across America as Covid-19 spread. Deaths shifted from diverse counties to those with a higher share of white people

Experts attribute the change to the evolving geography of the virus — a result of the failure by states and the federal government to curtail transmission. At the start of the US outbreak, coronavirus cases — and deaths — were concentrated in a few cities, which have large numbers of people of color who are more likely to do essential work. “The impact of Covid-19 was limited to New York, and to a lesser extent Detroit and New Orleans,” said Dartmouth health economist Jonathan Skinner, “and in particular among people who had to commute by public transportation to service-sector jobs.” Many Black and Hispanic people soon contracted the virus and died at very high rates — an estimated 118,000 in 2020 overall. By October, some of the most sparsely populated areas of the country — Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska — were grappling with America’s worst outbreaks. The relative share of deaths among white people started rising. “The politics of 2020 led governors in [these] parts of the country to be less aggressive in dealing with the virus or actively discourage public health safeguards,” Woolf said. At the same time, more states adopted face-mask orders and other safety measures. Mask mandates helped bring case numbers down, and may have saved the lives of some essential workers. The result: In August, Black people died at 2.5 times the rate of white people. By November, the rate was 2.2. In early February, it was 1.5. But minorities were disproportionately affected by the virus in every month of 2020. They were also much more likely to die young.

Of people over age 85 who died of Covid-19, 80 percent were white. Of those who died between the ages of 35 and 44, only 20 percent were white.

The data also reveals that regardless of race or geography, there is one group that has consistently experienced an extraordinarily high risk of death: the elderly. Age remains the greatest predictor overall of who lives after infection with the coronavirus and who dies.

Nearly half of all 2020 Covid-19 deaths were of people age 80 or older. If you include people age 60 or older, the share of deaths reaches almost 90 percent. With confirmed cases, the picture looks very different: Younger people, ages 20 to 59, are somewhat overrepresented.

In March through May, people age 80 and older had the most confirmed cases per capita (although testing for much of this time was limited). By June, that burden shifted to younger people. The summer case surge in young people was followed by a winter uptick in elderly deaths

2021-02-18 01:15:41+00:00,5,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-17 20:00:09+00:00,11,"The Covid-19 relief package proposed by President Joe Biden and being considered by Democrats in Congress could expand health care coverage to millions of people, the most significant step in the last 10 years toward patching up some of the holes in the Affordable Care Act.

The ACA led to a historically low uninsured rate in the US — 8.6 percent in 2016 — but the number of uninsured Americans started ticking up again during the Trump administration, rising to 9.2 percent by 2019. Then millions of people lost their insurance (along with their jobs) during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Covid-19 relief plan is trying to move the rate back in the other direction. The most effective provision would be a two-year expansion of the ACA’s premium subsidies, which Americans can use to purchase private health insurance on the marketplaces the law established.

The House version of the Covid-19 relief bill would increase the size of the subsidy for those already eligible for assistance (people making between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level). It would also extend subsidies for people earning more than 400 percent of the poverty level, ensuring that nobody would pay more than 8.5 percent of their income for health coverage.

This would provide help to one of the populations left out of the ACA: the roughly 2.6 million people who make too much money to qualify for subsidies and are currently uninsured.

Based on prior estimates of such a proposal, somewhere between 4 million and 5 million people would be expected to gain coverage as a result of expanding the subsidies. The Biden administration has already opened ACA enrollment to everybody until May 15, which would give people an immediate opening to take advantage of the new benefits.

However, there is a catch: The subsidy expansion expires after two years.

The reason appears to be twofold. One, Democrats say they want this package narrowly focused on the Covid-19 pandemic. Two, Democrats are using the budget reconciliation process with the aim of passing the bill without any Republican votes, so they need to be mindful of how much the bill costs. Extending the subsidies permanently would raise the price tag.

But the two-year limit creates an expiration date for these new benefits. To avoid it, Democrats would need to either permanently extend the subsidies in another reconciliation bill later this Congress, or find another way to make them permanent in the next two years to prevent millions of people from losing coverage if the assistance is allowed to lapse.

So the Democrats’ Covid-19 relief bill will deliver important and immediate help to uninsured people in the middle class. Helping uninsured Americans living in poverty, the other big gap in the ACA, is going to be more difficult.

The ACA was supposed to extend Medicaid eligibility to all people in poverty. But the Supreme Court ruled that states could not be forced to expand Medicaid, and a dozen GOP-led states have refused to do so. That has left about 2 million people uninsured, with no other realistic option for affording health insurance.

There is no easy fix for covering those people. During the presidential campaign, Biden proposed creating a new government insurance plan that would automatically enroll them — a public option — but that is not being proposed as part of the Covid-19 relief legislation, and it may not be permissible under the budget reconciliation rules.

Under the Covid-19 relief bill, if a state expanded Medicaid now, it would receive a 5 percent bump in federal funding for its traditional Medicaid population for the next two years.

Because many more people are covered by traditional Medicaid than by the expansion, that funding bump would be expected to more than cover the 10 percent share states are asked to pay for Medicaid expansion under the ACA. It’s a new way to sweeten the expansion deal, which already comes with a permanent 90 percent federal match for expansion enrollees, for the holdout states.

In theory, that would be a way to cover 2 million more people and provide help to another group left out of the ACA. But Republican states have refused expansion as much because of their ideological opposition to the health care law as they have because of the specifics of financing it. Health policy experts sound skeptical that the incentive Democrats are including in their Covid-19 package will be sufficient to change the states’ minds.

Even with this big incentive, my guess is few of the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid will change course. That's partly because the incentive is temporary.



That will leave over 2 million uninsured poor people with no options, which is a big gap in our health system. https://t.co/tTcRn7cYkS — Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) February 11, 2021

The Covid-19 relief bill does include other improvements to Medicaid, however, including new incentives for states to expand home and community-based services, assist the elderly and disabled populations that may have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and cover postpartum care for new mothers for 12 months.

Completing the work of universal coverage, which is what Biden’s campaign platform amounted to, will almost assuredly not be accomplished in the president’s first big legislative package. Democrats will likely face a lot of pressure from progressives to go bigger in the next reconciliation bill they pull together.

But this is, nevertheless, a start.",voxdotcom,"['bill', 'covid19', 'medicaid', 'health', 'obamacare', 'democrats', 'aca', 'states', 'relief', 'expansion', 'uninsured']",0

2021-02-17 15:48:49+00:00,5,"When the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, it may have seemed like a distant threat. But very quickly, the tiny pathogen made its way around the world, bringing sickness and death wherever it went. In America, the first known Covid-19 fatality occurred on February 6, 2020. From there, the wave of daily deaths started rising. By the end of May 2020, the virus had taken 100,000 lives, mostly in the Northeast and major cities. Four months later, the death toll surpassed 200,000. Less than three months later, by mid-December, more than 300,000 people had died. With the virus spreading all over the US, it took only 36 more days to reach 400,000 deaths. January was the deadliest month so far.

Who has died from Covid-19 in the US? The virus was unsparing.

Across the country, more than 28 million people have contracted the coronavirus, and over 500,000 have died. That’s the highest Covid-19 toll of any country and more than the coronavirus deaths in Italy, Germany, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, and France combined. It exceeds the US death toll in World War II. It’s also an underestimate, and doesn’t account for all the people impacted by loss. If every American who died has left nine people grieving, as one study suggested, there are now more than 4 million Americans who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. Death at this scale is difficult to comprehend, or visualize. To get a clearer sense of the shifting burden of Covid-19 deaths over time, Vox analyzed coronavirus mortality by age, region, and race from the past year, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. We found that while Covid-19 spared no group, it impacted certain populations more than others. Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus. They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black. But what started as a health emergency concentrated in travelers, urban minority communities, and other crowded places (such as nursing homes and prisons) fanned out into rural areas of the country, leading to a surge in deaths among white people, too. In the deaths, we saw how an “infectious disease became a universal issue,” said Boston University School of Public Health dean Sandro Galea. The extraordinary loss of life was also preventable, said Virginia Commonwealth University’s Steven Woolf, and a grim marker of “how poorly the US handled the pandemic.” By the winter of 2020, the virus was spreading broadly in every state, and largely by people younger than 50. Still, disparities in lives lost have persisted.

A trend at the start of the US outbreak has held: People of color have died of Covid-19 at much higher rates — double the rate of white people overall in 2020. But over the course of the year, the share of Covid-19 deaths among white people grew, while the share among Black and Hispanic people decreased.

In absolute terms, the death rate among white people rose significantly, while the rate among people of color dropped slightly. This was a trend we found in communities across America as Covid-19 spread. Deaths shifted from diverse counties to those with a higher share of white people

Experts attribute the change to the evolving geography of the virus — a result of the failure by states and the federal government to curtail transmission. At the start of the US outbreak, coronavirus cases — and deaths — were concentrated in a few cities, which have large numbers of people of color who are more likely to do essential work. “The impact of Covid-19 was limited to New York, and to a lesser extent Detroit and New Orleans,” said Dartmouth health economist Jonathan Skinner, “and in particular among people who had to commute by public transportation to service-sector jobs.” Many Black and Hispanic people soon contracted the virus and died at very high rates — an estimated 118,000 in 2020 overall. By October, some of the most sparsely populated areas of the country — Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska — were grappling with America’s worst outbreaks. The relative share of deaths among white people started rising. “The politics of 2020 led governors in [these] parts of the country to be less aggressive in dealing with the virus or actively discourage public health safeguards,” Woolf said. At the same time, more states adopted face-mask orders and other safety measures. Mask mandates helped bring case numbers down, and may have saved the lives of some essential workers. The result: In August, Black people died at 2.5 times the rate of white people. By November, the rate was 2.2. In early February, it was 1.5. But minorities were disproportionately affected by the virus in every month of 2020. They were also much more likely to die young.

Of people over age 85 who died of Covid-19, 80 percent were white. Of those who died between the ages of 35 and 44, only 20 percent were white.

The data also reveals that regardless of race or geography, there is one group that has consistently experienced an extraordinarily high risk of death: the elderly. Age remains the greatest predictor overall of who lives after infection with the coronavirus and who dies.

Nearly half of all 2020 Covid-19 deaths were of people age 80 or older. If you include people age 60 or older, the share of deaths reaches almost 90 percent. With confirmed cases, the picture looks very different: Younger people, ages 20 to 59, are somewhat overrepresented.

In March through May, people age 80 and older had the most confirmed cases per capita (although testing for much of this time was limited). By June, that burden shifted to younger people. The summer case surge in young people was followed by a winter uptick in elderly deaths

But what started as a health emergency concentrated in travelers, urban minority communities, and other crowded places (such as nursing homes and prisons) fanned out into rural areas of the country, leading to a surge in deaths among white people, too. In the deaths, we saw how an “infectious disease became a universal issue,” said Boston University School of Public Health dean Sandro Galea. The extraordinary loss of life was also preventable, said Virginia Commonwealth University’s Steven Woolf, and a grim marker of “how poorly the US handled the pandemic.” By the winter of 2020, the virus was spreading broadly in every state, and largely by people younger than 50. Still, disparities in lives lost have persisted.

A trend at the start of the US outbreak has held: People of color have died of Covid-19 at much higher rates — double the rate of white people overall in 2020. But over the course of the year, the share of Covid-19 deaths among white people grew, while the share among Black and Hispanic people decreased.

In absolute terms, the death rate among white people rose significantly, while the rate among people of color dropped slightly. This was a trend we found in communities across America as Covid-19 spread. Deaths shifted from diverse counties to those with a higher share of white people

Experts attribute the change to the evolving geography of the virus — a result of the failure by states and the federal government to curtail transmission. At the start of the US outbreak, coronavirus cases — and deaths — were concentrated in a few cities, which have large numbers of people of color who are more likely to do essential work. “The impact of Covid-19 was limited to New York, and to a lesser extent Detroit and New Orleans,” said Dartmouth health economist Jonathan Skinner, “and in particular among people who had to commute by public transportation to service-sector jobs.” Many Black and Hispanic people soon contracted the virus and died at very high rates — an estimated 118,000 in 2020 overall. By October, some of the most sparsely populated areas of the country — Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska — were grappling with America’s worst outbreaks. The relative share of deaths among white people started rising. “The politics of 2020 led governors in [these] parts of the country to be less aggressive in dealing with the virus or actively discourage public health safeguards,” Woolf said. At the same time, more states adopted face-mask orders and other safety measures. Mask mandates helped bring case numbers down, and may have saved the lives of some essential workers. The result: In August, Black people died at 2.5 times the rate of white people. By November, the rate was 2.2. In early February, it was 1.5. But minorities were disproportionately affected by the virus in every month of 2020. They were also much more likely to die young.

The data also reveals that regardless of race or geography, there is one group that has consistently experienced an extraordinarily high risk of death: the elderly. Age remains the greatest predictor overall of who lives after infection with the coronavirus and who dies.

Nearly half of all 2020 Covid-19 deaths were of people age 80 or older. If you include people age 60 or older, the share of deaths reaches almost 90 percent. With confirmed cases, the picture looks very different: Younger people, ages 20 to 59, are somewhat overrepresented.

In March through May, people age 80 and older had the most confirmed cases per capita (although testing for much of this time was limited). By June, that burden shifted to younger people. The summer case surge in young people was followed by a winter uptick in elderly deaths

2021-02-16 21:40:28+00:00,14,"When the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, it may have seemed like a distant threat. But very quickly, the tiny pathogen made its way around the world, bringing sickness and death wherever it went. In America, the first known Covid-19 fatality occurred on February 6, 2020. From there, the wave of daily deaths started rising. By the end of May 2020, the virus had taken 100,000 lives, mostly in the Northeast and major cities. Four months later, the death toll surpassed 200,000. Less than three months later, by mid-December, more than 300,000 people had died. With the virus spreading all over the US, it took only 36 more days to reach 400,000 deaths. January was the deadliest month so far.

Who has died from Covid-19 in the US? The virus was unsparing.

Across the country, more than 28 million people have contracted the coronavirus, and over 500,000 have died. That’s the highest Covid-19 toll of any country and more than the coronavirus deaths in Italy, Germany, Australia, Japan, the UK, Canada, and France combined. It exceeds the US death toll in World War II. It’s also an underestimate, and doesn’t account for all the people impacted by loss. If every American who died has left nine people grieving, as one study suggested, there are now more than 4 million Americans who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. Death at this scale is difficult to comprehend, or visualize. To get a clearer sense of the shifting burden of Covid-19 deaths over time, Vox analyzed coronavirus mortality by age, region, and race from the past year, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. We found that while Covid-19 spared no group, it impacted certain populations more than others. Throughout the pandemic, people of color have consistently been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus. They also died young: Of Covid-19 deaths in people under the age of 45, more than 40 percent were Hispanic and about a quarter were Black.

2021-02-15 21:41:33+00:00,43,"The Food and Drug Administration is working through thousands of pages of documentation for an emergency authorization of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which could come through this month. Most states are gradually expanding vaccine eligibility, production of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is increasing, and new studies show good results for additional vaccine candidates as well.

The news on the Covid-19 vaccine front of late has been quite good — perhaps so good that our perspective on the fight against the pandemic may be getting a little warped.

Case in point: the media coverage and public reception of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Results from its trials were released last week. According to the company, it should be able to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of this year. But this good news hasn’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanied announcements about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Perhaps that’s because in its clinical trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy number — the percentage of cases prevented entirely — of 66 percent. Compared against the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine and the 94.1 rate for Moderna’s, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine simply doesn’t look as good.

But in another sense, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial results were incredibly encouraging. The same trial showed that J&J’s vaccine makes Covid-19 cases much milder, meaning you might still get sick but you are much less likely to be hospitalized or die. Indeed, on that front, the J&J vaccine performs just as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, a fact that seems to have been undersold in news coverage about it.

To put J&J’s effectiveness in another context, think about the flu. Flu vaccines mostly don’t prevent you from getting sick with the flu but instead make the flu much less awful if you catch it and less fatal for at-risk populations. A Covid-19 vaccine that was similar to that — one that made you much less likely to be hospitalized or die, and made the disease milder — would still be enough to help bring the pandemic to an end and give us back our lives.

That’s exactly what we have with the current crop of vaccines, including the three that haven’t been received as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. No one who got two doses in clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines has been hospitalized or died, and the same holds true for the new vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Novavax (which haven’t yet been approved in the US). Each of the vaccines has demonstrated very high protection against severe Covid-19 in trials.

So why aren’t we talking about that?

How “efficacy” became the measure of vaccine success

The vaccines developed against Covid-19 can protect people in three ways. First, they can make the vaccinated person less likely to catch the disease. That’s called “efficacy.” It’s the number that made the headlines when Pfizer and Moderna results came out this fall — 95 percent and 94.1 percent efficacy, respectively. For every 20 people in the control group to develop symptoms of Covid-19, only one in the vaccinated group did.

That’s an incredible achievement, and it’s what’s gotten most of the attention in the reporting on the vaccines. But it has overshadowed discussion of the other two ways a vaccine against Covid-19 can protect people.

The second is that the vaccines seem to make vaccinated people less likely to transmit the disease; new research suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do this, too, though imperfectly (so you should still be cautious around unvaccinated people).

And the third way the vaccines can protect people is by ensuring that when a vaccinated person does get the disease, they experience a mild case and are not likely to require hospitalization or be at risk of dying.

This last finding is a big deal. As long as vaccines can make sure that Covid-19, even if you get it, isn’t very bad, we can use them to chart our way out of the pandemic. But this effect of the vaccines has been largely neglected.

Now, there’s a reason headlines have focused on the efficacy of preventing all disease rather than severe disease: It’s what the earliest clinical trials were primarily set up to study.

Every clinical trial defines in advance a primary clinical endpoint: the outcome researchers are primarily focused on studying. The study is designed to have a large enough sample size to detect differences in this primary outcome between the trial group and the placebo group. For the vaccine trials, the primary clinical endpoint has largely been symptomatic Covid-19 infection (however mild or severe), or, in some cases, a positive Covid-19 PCR test.

It makes sense for the studies to set that endpoint. Designing a study to measure rare events like hospitalization or death is much harder than designing a study to measure relatively common events like infection. Covid-19 is a scary disease, but less than 1 percent of people who get it will die from it. That means that a study designed with death from Covid-19 as a primary clinical endpoint would need to be enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of participants. Pinning down the exact frequency of rare events requires a lot of data, and vaccine developers could only include so many people in their first clinical trials because recruiting and coordinating participants is expensive and time-consuming.

So instead, most studies primarily measure how many cases of Covid-19 the vaccines prevent. They do collect data on hospitalizations and deaths, but it’s not the primary outcome their studies are designed to measure, and that has been reflected in press releases, media coverage, and the popular understanding of how well the vaccines work.

As it happens, that data on hospitalizations and deaths looks really good. Indeed, there have been zero cases of hospitalization or death in clinical trials for all of these vaccines. But we hear about that less partly because the studies weren’t designed with that outcome in mind.

This focus on preventing cases, rather than preventing cases as well as hospitalizations and deaths, may have led to the sentiment that the new, unapproved vaccines are worse, and that it’s okay that the US isn’t expediting their approval and distribution because people would rather get the better vaccines anyway. This line of reasoning would be understandable if some vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death and some are only 60 percent effective. But in this instance, it’s a mistake, since all of the vaccines are indistinguishably effective by this metric.

The focus on studying efficacy, instead of studying hospitalization and death, affects major policy calls.

South Africa suspended its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a new study found that the vaccine had very low — potentially zero — efficacy against the variant strain of the disease that predominates in the country. Obviously, that finding was really bad news for the AstraZeneca vaccine. But less widely broadcast was the fact that no one in the study got seriously ill or was hospitalized from Covid-19 (no one in the placebo group did, either; the study was small and didn’t contain at-risk people).

Now, let’s be clear: While other studies have convincingly demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against hospitalization and death, it seems to work less well against the South African virus variant, and that might well mean it works less well to prevent hospitalization and death as well. One crucial caveat here is that the study population was young; we would not have expected many hospitalizations or any deaths within that age group. So it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine has very limited usefulness against the new strain. Or it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers very strong protection against severe disease from the new strain. The study was not set up to answer that question, so we simply don’t know.

In that regard, South Africa’s decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout based on the discouraging data makes some sense. But countries that have focused on hospitalization and death statistics, rather than efficacy statistics, have made the opposite call.

“I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, defending Britain’s continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Countries face tough choices here, and their leaders would be able to make a vastly more informed decision if there had been a study with sufficient statistical power — a lot more participants — to detect whether the vaccine is protecting against hospitalization and death. As it is, the understandable focus on efficacy simply doesn’t give us much information on this essential question.

The communications challenge of vaccine statistics

In the past few weeks, some public health experts have started working to change the conversation on vaccines to focus on the key hospitalization and death numbers. One person leading this effort is Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tweeted on January 31:

Am often asked about different vaccines and their efficacy



Each trials tracks, reports efficacy differently



Currently, we have preliminary results for Novavax and J&J



But what numbers matter? What should you look for?



Here's one set of data to track. In a simple table pic.twitter.com/9m2OBgqcla — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) February 1, 2021

One note about this data: It refers only to the clinical trials. Now that the vaccine is out in the world, we’re getting real-world data. The news is still good: 700,000 people in Israel have been vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and there have in fact been a few hospitalizations — 16, to be precise, for a rate of 0.002 percent — and no deaths.

Jha’s message was widely shared, but efficacy still continues to be the statistic that people fixate on.

Communications about severe disease and hospitalization face an uphill battle. Efficacy is much easier to explain — do you get sick or not? For severe disease, on the other hand, many studies have slightly different benchmarks for severity. And while right now there have been zero hospitalizations and zero deaths by anyone vaccinated in the clinical trials for any of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, it doesn’t mean those outcomes are guaranteed. (Again, in Israel, 0.002 percent have been hospitalized so far — that’s very, very low, but it’s not zero.)

Furthermore, as the pandemic stretches into its second year, we’re all desperate for certainty. “This study simply didn’t collect enough data to tell us what we hoped to learn” is not the answer any of us are looking for. The efficacy of the vaccines is known; their effectiveness against hospitalization and death is known to be very high but not pinned down for certain, especially not against the South African variant. All of those pose extraordinary challenges for public health officials and the media to communicate.

But a shift from a focus on efficacy to a focus on improved outcomes is essential for good vaccine decision-making. Moderna and Pfizer can’t produce enough mRNA vaccines alone to end the pandemic, so the public embrace of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — and potentially the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which we’re waiting to learn more on — might make a huge difference for whether things start to get back to normal in the US in April or in August. That’s a difference of potentially hundreds of thousands of lives lost.",voxdotcom,"['important', 'looking', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'clinical', 'johnson', 'disease', 'study', 'statistic', 'hospitalization', 'death', 'vaccines']",0

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0

2021-02-15 01:51:38+00:00,467,"The Food and Drug Administration is working through thousands of pages of documentation for an emergency authorization of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which could come through this month. Most states are gradually expanding vaccine eligibility, production of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is increasing, and new studies show good results for additional vaccine candidates as well.

The news on the Covid-19 vaccine front of late has been quite good — perhaps so good that our perspective on the fight against the pandemic may be getting a little warped.

Case in point: the media coverage and public reception of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Results from its trials were released last week. According to the company, it should be able to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of this year. But this good news hasn’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanied announcements about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Perhaps that’s because in its clinical trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy number — the percentage of cases prevented entirely — of 66 percent. Compared against the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine and the 94.1 rate for Moderna’s, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine simply doesn’t look as good.

But in another sense, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial results were incredibly encouraging. The same trial showed that J&J’s vaccine makes Covid-19 cases much milder, meaning you might still get sick but you are much less likely to be hospitalized or die. Indeed, on that front, the J&J vaccine performs just as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, a fact that seems to have been undersold in news coverage about it.

To put J&J’s effectiveness in another context, think about the flu. Flu vaccines mostly don’t prevent you from getting sick with the flu but instead make the flu much less awful if you catch it and less fatal for at-risk populations. A Covid-19 vaccine that was similar to that — one that made you much less likely to be hospitalized or die, and made the disease milder — would still be enough to help bring the pandemic to an end and give us back our lives.

That’s exactly what we have with the current crop of vaccines, including the three that haven’t been received as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. No one who got two doses in clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines has been hospitalized or died, and the same holds true for the new vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Novavax (which haven’t yet been approved in the US). Each of the vaccines has demonstrated very high protection against severe Covid-19 in trials.

So why aren’t we talking about that?

How “efficacy” became the measure of vaccine success

The vaccines developed against Covid-19 can protect people in three ways. First, they can make the vaccinated person less likely to catch the disease. That’s called “efficacy.” It’s the number that made the headlines when Pfizer and Moderna results came out this fall — 95 percent and 94.1 percent efficacy, respectively. For every 20 people in the control group to develop symptoms of Covid-19, only one in the vaccinated group did.

That’s an incredible achievement, and it’s what’s gotten most of the attention in the reporting on the vaccines. But it has overshadowed discussion of the other two ways a vaccine against Covid-19 can protect people.

The second is that the vaccines seem to make vaccinated people less likely to transmit the disease; new research suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do this, too, though imperfectly (so you should still be cautious around unvaccinated people).

And the third way the vaccines can protect people is by ensuring that when a vaccinated person does get the disease, they experience a mild case and are not likely to require hospitalization or be at risk of dying.

This last finding is a big deal. As long as vaccines can make sure that Covid-19, even if you get it, isn’t very bad, we can use them to chart our way out of the pandemic. But this effect of the vaccines has been largely neglected.

Now, there’s a reason headlines have focused on the efficacy of preventing all disease rather than severe disease: It’s what the earliest clinical trials were primarily set up to study.

Every clinical trial defines in advance a primary clinical endpoint: the outcome researchers are primarily focused on studying. The study is designed to have a large enough sample size to detect differences in this primary outcome between the trial group and the placebo group. For the vaccine trials, the primary clinical endpoint has largely been symptomatic Covid-19 infection (however mild or severe), or, in some cases, a positive Covid-19 PCR test.

It makes sense for the studies to set that endpoint. Designing a study to measure rare events like hospitalization or death is much harder than designing a study to measure relatively common events like infection. Covid-19 is a scary disease, but less than 1 percent of people who get it will die from it. That means that a study designed with death from Covid-19 as a primary clinical endpoint would need to be enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of participants. Pinning down the exact frequency of rare events requires a lot of data, and vaccine developers could only include so many people in their first clinical trials because recruiting and coordinating participants is expensive and time-consuming.

So instead, most studies primarily measure how many cases of Covid-19 the vaccines prevent. They do collect data on hospitalizations and deaths, but it’s not the primary outcome their studies are designed to measure, and that has been reflected in press releases, media coverage, and the popular understanding of how well the vaccines work.

As it happens, that data on hospitalizations and deaths looks really good. Indeed, there have been zero cases of hospitalization or death in clinical trials for all of these vaccines. But we hear about that less partly because the studies weren’t designed with that outcome in mind.

This focus on preventing cases, rather than preventing cases as well as hospitalizations and deaths, may have led to the sentiment that the new, unapproved vaccines are worse, and that it’s okay that the US isn’t expediting their approval and distribution because people would rather get the better vaccines anyway. This line of reasoning would be understandable if some vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death and some are only 60 percent effective. But in this instance, it’s a mistake, since all of the vaccines are indistinguishably effective by this metric.

The focus on studying efficacy, instead of studying hospitalization and death, affects major policy calls.

South Africa suspended its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a new study found that the vaccine had very low — potentially zero — efficacy against the variant strain of the disease that predominates in the country. Obviously, that finding was really bad news for the AstraZeneca vaccine. But less widely broadcast was the fact that no one in the study got seriously ill or was hospitalized from Covid-19 (no one in the placebo group did, either; the study was small and didn’t contain at-risk people).

Now, let’s be clear: While other studies have convincingly demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against hospitalization and death, it seems to work less well against the South African virus variant, and that might well mean it works less well to prevent hospitalization and death as well. One crucial caveat here is that the study population was young; we would not have expected many hospitalizations or any deaths within that age group. So it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine has very limited usefulness against the new strain. Or it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers very strong protection against severe disease from the new strain. The study was not set up to answer that question, so we simply don’t know.

In that regard, South Africa’s decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout based on the discouraging data makes some sense. But countries that have focused on hospitalization and death statistics, rather than efficacy statistics, have made the opposite call.

“I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, defending Britain’s continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Countries face tough choices here, and their leaders would be able to make a vastly more informed decision if there had been a study with sufficient statistical power — a lot more participants — to detect whether the vaccine is protecting against hospitalization and death. As it is, the understandable focus on efficacy simply doesn’t give us much information on this essential question.

The communications challenge of vaccine statistics

In the past few weeks, some public health experts have started working to change the conversation on vaccines to focus on the key hospitalization and death numbers. One person leading this effort is Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tweeted on January 31:

Am often asked about different vaccines and their efficacy



Each trials tracks, reports efficacy differently



Currently, we have preliminary results for Novavax and J&J



But what numbers matter? What should you look for?



Here's one set of data to track. In a simple table pic.twitter.com/9m2OBgqcla — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) February 1, 2021

One note about this data: It refers only to the clinical trials. Now that the vaccine is out in the world, we’re getting real-world data. The news is still good: 700,000 people in Israel have been vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and there have in fact been a few hospitalizations — 16, to be precise, for a rate of 0.002 percent — and no deaths.

Jha’s message was widely shared, but efficacy still continues to be the statistic that people fixate on.

Communications about severe disease and hospitalization face an uphill battle. Efficacy is much easier to explain — do you get sick or not? For severe disease, on the other hand, many studies have slightly different benchmarks for severity. And while right now there have been zero hospitalizations and zero deaths by anyone vaccinated in the clinical trials for any of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, it doesn’t mean those outcomes are guaranteed. (Again, in Israel, 0.002 percent have been hospitalized so far — that’s very, very low, but it’s not zero.)

Furthermore, as the pandemic stretches into its second year, we’re all desperate for certainty. “This study simply didn’t collect enough data to tell us what we hoped to learn” is not the answer any of us are looking for. The efficacy of the vaccines is known; their effectiveness against hospitalization and death is known to be very high but not pinned down for certain, especially not against the South African variant. All of those pose extraordinary challenges for public health officials and the media to communicate.

But a shift from a focus on efficacy to a focus on improved outcomes is essential for good vaccine decision-making. Moderna and Pfizer can’t produce enough mRNA vaccines alone to end the pandemic, so the public embrace of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — and potentially the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which we’re waiting to learn more on — might make a huge difference for whether things start to get back to normal in the US in April or in August. That’s a difference of potentially hundreds of thousands of lives lost.",voxdotcom,"['important', 'looking', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'clinical', 'johnson', 'disease', 'study', 'statistic', 'hospitalization', 'death', 'vaccines']",0
2021-02-15 00:51:03+00:00,27,"February 6 marks the anniversary of the first American death from the coronavirus.

Since then, well over 400,000 Americans have died from complications related to Covid-19. It’s likely many more will die before we’re finally over the hump. It goes without saying that no matter who was in charge last year, this pandemic would have killed lots of people. But it’s also true that bad leadership costs many lives, and we’ll never know for sure how many could have been spared.

The story of America’s failure is long and complicated. When the full history is finally written, the depth of those failures will likely shock even those of us who have followed it closely in real time.

For now, the closest thing we have to a comprehensive account of America’s botched response to the coronavirus is Lawrence Wright’s sweeping story in the New Yorker. Published in December, just a few days before the year ended, the story documents what happened and when, and who was responsible — a staggering piece of reporting that goes as deep as anything written thus far.

Wright highlights three moments at which America could’ve have gotten things right but, for various reasons, didn’t. It’s as depressing as it is illuminating. I reached out to Wright, who also wrote The End of October, a 2020 novel about a pandemic originating in Asia (seriously), to talk about those three pivotal moments.

Beyond diagnosing what went wrong, I asked Wright what the federal government could have done differently and if he thinks a competent administration with a serious plan might’ve saved hundreds of thousands of lives. He explained what happened in exquisite detail, and I have to say, it’s maddening. This was indeed a tragedy and, as Wright suggests, one of the greatest failures in the history of American governance.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You say there are three moments in which America’s Covid-19 response might have gone in a very different direction. Walk me through the first moment, in which China basically attempts to hide the scale of the pandemic in those early days.

Lawrence Wright

Right, the first moment occurs when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke to George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 3, 2020. This was already a fraught moment. Gao had really just started to discover the scale of the thing, and part of the dilemma was that in China people are afraid to report things up the chain. He was basically reading about what was happening on social media.

The tragic part about this moment is that Gao could not invite the American CDC team to come to China and help investigate the outbreak, and that set us back enormously. Redfield is sure that, had the CDC team been able to visit China at that point, we would’ve discovered that there was asymptomatic transmission, something we didn’t know at that point. This was already something that was being talked about in medical circles in China. It wouldn’t have been a secret. But the US, and really the rest of the world, did not figure this out until late February or early March. And had they known that, the strategy for dealing with this outbreak would have been entirely different.

“This was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad”

Sean Illing

Can the CDC be faulted for this, or is there little they could’ve done in the face of China’s intransigence?

Lawrence Wright

No, the CDC alone could not have done much. But the American government could have made it a much bigger issue, and we simply didn’t do it. People sat back and took the Chinese at their word. And look, China’s behavior at the beginning of this outbreak is nefarious. But the countries that knew China well — for instance, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan — they took precautions because they didn’t believe the Chinese assurances. And unfortunately, we didn’t do that. That was the first setback in our response and what I’d call strike one.

Sean Illing

Did you get any good answers as to why we sat back? It can’t be as simple as naiveté, can it? Or was the US government just scared to death of antagonizing China?

Lawrence Wright

All of those things were at play. There was absolutely a fear of antagonizing China. A great example of that is that we wanted to get our diplomats and businesspeople out of Wuhan, and China threw a fit. There was a “How dare you!” quality to their reaction. And in order to placate the Chinese, we sent these 747s over that we were going to use to pick up our citizens, and we stuffed it full of PPE gear, something like 18 tons of it. And we did it purely to mollify the Chinese.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the second moment.

Lawrence Wright

The second one was the fumble on the testing. The fault lies principally with CDC. But also, the FDA plays a role in this tragedy. The CDC was always the gold standard for public health agencies around the world. And one of the things they do is, they create tests for diseases. And they’ve been very good at that in the past. And of course, they were under terrific pressure in this moment and that in turn led to them taking some shortcuts.

So there are typically two main elements in a normal test kit, or two parts to the test. One is the primers and probes, as they call them, which detect the presence of viral antibodies. And the other is a piece of RNA that represents the virus. And these two things go together to make a test kit. Normally, you have them manufactured in separate facilities because it contaminates if you have them both in the same house. So the CDC took a shortcut. And they sent out the test kits knowing that it failed their own internal quality check. The fail rate was around 30 percent. But they sent out the kits anyway and they were totally unreliable.

Sean Illing

Wait, how the hell does that happen?

Lawrence Wright

The CDC didn’t know if it was a design problem or a manufacturing problem. They couldn’t figure it out. So the FDA sent this guy, Timothy Stenzel, down to Atlanta, the CDC headquarters. And it was immediately apparent what had happened. The lab was contaminated. They were processing samples of the test in the same room where they were making the test. So live virus samples were in the same room. And a mistake like that, you just can’t imagine the Centers for Disease Control doing that.

But there was another thing going on. There were three elements in the primers and probes, numbered one, two, and three. Numbers one and two detected against the SARS-CoV-2 and number three detected any coronavirus, in case it mutated. That was the element that failed. The test worked, except for that third element. All they had to do was to eliminate that third element and you would have a valid test. And the FDA refused to bend on this authorization, for weeks. We lost all of February because of the incompetence and inertia on the part of the CDC and FDA.

Sean Illing

You say we “lost all of February,” but what does that mean exactly? Can we even begin to speculate how many lives this dithering and incompetence cost?

Lawrence Wright

Well, there are models that show, at every step along the way, had the Chinese been more forthcoming earlier, had the Chinese shut down Wuhan earlier, had we gotten the test out sooner, it would have made an enormous difference in terms of the spread of the virus and the number of lives lost. We can’t say for sure, but had these things gone differently, we would be dealing with a fraction of what we’re facing now.

“More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured”

Sean Illing

Did anyone at the CDC or the FDA explain to you why in the world they sent out test kits knowing they were faulty?

Lawrence Wright

I asked Redfield about it and he said someone violated protocol. And that’s about it. They have an internal examination. No one’s really been held accountable. No one’s been fired. No one’s been fingered. But it’s pretty clear that it happened in the lab of Stephen Lindstrom, who was overseeing the test. And so far, there’s been no accountability for the failure in CDC.

I have to say that there’s been no real accountability at the FDA either. Because the FDA could have been responsive to the fact that the test obviously worked if you removed this third element. And they eventually did get it right, but they could have done it weeks earlier and, as I said, the consequences of this delay were enormous.

Sean Illing

There’s a crucial moment, on January 23, when a physician (Dr. Rick Bright) from HHS (Health and Human Services) tells various Trump officials, including Secretary Alex Azar, that the “virus might already be here,” and you write that the Trump people “seemed determined to ignore” the news. Does that mean they literally ignored it or does it mean they kept searching for “experts” to tell them what they wanted to hear?

Lawrence Wright

Both of those things were going on. They didn’t want to hear the news. They didn’t want to hear any bad news. But also there was this longing for someone to come along and say, “This is not a problem. It’s going away. And if you do nothing, we’ll be fine.” And Scott Atlas served that purpose.

Sean Illing

Wait, who is Scott Atlas?

Lawrence Wright

Scott Atlas is a neuroradiologist from Stanford who had been on Fox News a lot, saying that we needed to open up the schools, which is a legitimate debate. But he was advocating for “herd immunity,” which is this idea that when enough people have been either vaccinated or infected, the population at large is no longer susceptible to the spread of the disease. The main concept of herd immunity is, let people get sick. We don’t have the vaccine yet. If people get sick, then that will begin to choke off the spread.

The great appeal for the Trump administration was that you can achieve herd immunity by doing nothing. And that became the unspoken policy.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the third moment.

This is, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all. Because in strike one and strike two, the rate of infection in the United States was still seemingly small. We didn’t have the tests, so we didn’t really know. But the sense of threat wasn’t as great. But when March rolls in and then you have New York City going into this horrible first wave, and the danger we’re facing is clear.

And all through February and March, Matt Pottinger, the deputy NSC (National Security Council) adviser, had been advocating for masks. And he was the only one in the White House who wore one. Finally in, I think it was April 3, the CDC swung around and recommended mask wearing in public after initially saying masks weren’t necessary.

If you look back at public health statements about masks, Dr. Fauci said that it wasn’t important for Americans to be wearing masks. And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad. If we had only done as good a job as Vietnam or South Korea, we could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of American lives. And we were supposed to be the country best equipped to deal with the pandemic. We had better resources than any country on earth. And that just makes the failure all the more catastrophic because we could have done a good job. And we did the worst job in the world.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'response', 'lawrence', 'covid19', 'cdc', 'botched', 'job', 'americas', 'masks', 'things', 'failure', 'going', 'say', 'world', 'didnt', 'worst', 'test', 'moment', 'wright']",0

2021-02-13 13:55:09+00:00,6,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-13 11:56:56+00:00,134,"February 6 marks the anniversary of the first American death from the coronavirus.

Since then, well over 400,000 Americans have died from complications related to Covid-19. It’s likely many more will die before we’re finally over the hump. It goes without saying that no matter who was in charge last year, this pandemic would have killed lots of people. But it’s also true that bad leadership costs many lives, and we’ll never know for sure how many could have been spared.

The story of America’s failure is long and complicated. When the full history is finally written, the depth of those failures will likely shock even those of us who have followed it closely in real time.

For now, the closest thing we have to a comprehensive account of America’s botched response to the coronavirus is Lawrence Wright’s sweeping story in the New Yorker. Published in December, just a few days before the year ended, the story documents what happened and when, and who was responsible — a staggering piece of reporting that goes as deep as anything written thus far.

Wright highlights three moments at which America could’ve have gotten things right but, for various reasons, didn’t. It’s as depressing as it is illuminating. I reached out to Wright, who also wrote The End of October, a 2020 novel about a pandemic originating in Asia (seriously), to talk about those three pivotal moments.

Beyond diagnosing what went wrong, I asked Wright what the federal government could have done differently and if he thinks a competent administration with a serious plan might’ve saved hundreds of thousands of lives. He explained what happened in exquisite detail, and I have to say, it’s maddening. This was indeed a tragedy and, as Wright suggests, one of the greatest failures in the history of American governance.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You say there are three moments in which America’s Covid-19 response might have gone in a very different direction. Walk me through the first moment, in which China basically attempts to hide the scale of the pandemic in those early days.

Lawrence Wright

Right, the first moment occurs when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke to George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 3, 2020. This was already a fraught moment. Gao had really just started to discover the scale of the thing, and part of the dilemma was that in China people are afraid to report things up the chain. He was basically reading about what was happening on social media.

The tragic part about this moment is that Gao could not invite the American CDC team to come to China and help investigate the outbreak, and that set us back enormously. Redfield is sure that, had the CDC team been able to visit China at that point, we would’ve discovered that there was asymptomatic transmission, something we didn’t know at that point. This was already something that was being talked about in medical circles in China. It wouldn’t have been a secret. But the US, and really the rest of the world, did not figure this out until late February or early March. And had they known that, the strategy for dealing with this outbreak would have been entirely different.

“This was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad”

Sean Illing

Can the CDC be faulted for this, or is there little they could’ve done in the face of China’s intransigence?

Lawrence Wright

No, the CDC alone could not have done much. But the American government could have made it a much bigger issue, and we simply didn’t do it. People sat back and took the Chinese at their word. And look, China’s behavior at the beginning of this outbreak is nefarious. But the countries that knew China well — for instance, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan — they took precautions because they didn’t believe the Chinese assurances. And unfortunately, we didn’t do that. That was the first setback in our response and what I’d call strike one.

Sean Illing

Did you get any good answers as to why we sat back? It can’t be as simple as naiveté, can it? Or was the US government just scared to death of antagonizing China?

Lawrence Wright

All of those things were at play. There was absolutely a fear of antagonizing China. A great example of that is that we wanted to get our diplomats and businesspeople out of Wuhan, and China threw a fit. There was a “How dare you!” quality to their reaction. And in order to placate the Chinese, we sent these 747s over that we were going to use to pick up our citizens, and we stuffed it full of PPE gear, something like 18 tons of it. And we did it purely to mollify the Chinese.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the second moment.

Lawrence Wright

The second one was the fumble on the testing. The fault lies principally with CDC. But also, the FDA plays a role in this tragedy. The CDC was always the gold standard for public health agencies around the world. And one of the things they do is, they create tests for diseases. And they’ve been very good at that in the past. And of course, they were under terrific pressure in this moment and that in turn led to them taking some shortcuts.

So there are typically two main elements in a normal test kit, or two parts to the test. One is the primers and probes, as they call them, which detect the presence of viral antibodies. And the other is a piece of RNA that represents the virus. And these two things go together to make a test kit. Normally, you have them manufactured in separate facilities because it contaminates if you have them both in the same house. So the CDC took a shortcut. And they sent out the test kits knowing that it failed their own internal quality check. The fail rate was around 30 percent. But they sent out the kits anyway and they were totally unreliable.

Sean Illing

Wait, how the hell does that happen?

Lawrence Wright

The CDC didn’t know if it was a design problem or a manufacturing problem. They couldn’t figure it out. So the FDA sent this guy, Timothy Stenzel, down to Atlanta, the CDC headquarters. And it was immediately apparent what had happened. The lab was contaminated. They were processing samples of the test in the same room where they were making the test. So live virus samples were in the same room. And a mistake like that, you just can’t imagine the Centers for Disease Control doing that.

But there was another thing going on. There were three elements in the primers and probes, numbered one, two, and three. Numbers one and two detected against the SARS-CoV-2 and number three detected any coronavirus, in case it mutated. That was the element that failed. The test worked, except for that third element. All they had to do was to eliminate that third element and you would have a valid test. And the FDA refused to bend on this authorization, for weeks. We lost all of February because of the incompetence and inertia on the part of the CDC and FDA.

Sean Illing

You say we “lost all of February,” but what does that mean exactly? Can we even begin to speculate how many lives this dithering and incompetence cost?

Lawrence Wright

Well, there are models that show, at every step along the way, had the Chinese been more forthcoming earlier, had the Chinese shut down Wuhan earlier, had we gotten the test out sooner, it would have made an enormous difference in terms of the spread of the virus and the number of lives lost. We can’t say for sure, but had these things gone differently, we would be dealing with a fraction of what we’re facing now.

“More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured”

Sean Illing

Did anyone at the CDC or the FDA explain to you why in the world they sent out test kits knowing they were faulty?

Lawrence Wright

I asked Redfield about it and he said someone violated protocol. And that’s about it. They have an internal examination. No one’s really been held accountable. No one’s been fired. No one’s been fingered. But it’s pretty clear that it happened in the lab of Stephen Lindstrom, who was overseeing the test. And so far, there’s been no accountability for the failure in CDC.

I have to say that there’s been no real accountability at the FDA either. Because the FDA could have been responsive to the fact that the test obviously worked if you removed this third element. And they eventually did get it right, but they could have done it weeks earlier and, as I said, the consequences of this delay were enormous.

Sean Illing

There’s a crucial moment, on January 23, when a physician (Dr. Rick Bright) from HHS (Health and Human Services) tells various Trump officials, including Secretary Alex Azar, that the “virus might already be here,” and you write that the Trump people “seemed determined to ignore” the news. Does that mean they literally ignored it or does it mean they kept searching for “experts” to tell them what they wanted to hear?

Lawrence Wright

Both of those things were going on. They didn’t want to hear the news. They didn’t want to hear any bad news. But also there was this longing for someone to come along and say, “This is not a problem. It’s going away. And if you do nothing, we’ll be fine.” And Scott Atlas served that purpose.

Sean Illing

Wait, who is Scott Atlas?

Lawrence Wright

Scott Atlas is a neuroradiologist from Stanford who had been on Fox News a lot, saying that we needed to open up the schools, which is a legitimate debate. But he was advocating for “herd immunity,” which is this idea that when enough people have been either vaccinated or infected, the population at large is no longer susceptible to the spread of the disease. The main concept of herd immunity is, let people get sick. We don’t have the vaccine yet. If people get sick, then that will begin to choke off the spread.

The great appeal for the Trump administration was that you can achieve herd immunity by doing nothing. And that became the unspoken policy.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the third moment.

Lawrence Wright

This is, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all. Because in strike one and strike two, the rate of infection in the United States was still seemingly small. We didn’t have the tests, so we didn’t really know. But the sense of threat wasn’t as great. But when March rolls in and then you have New York City going into this horrible first wave, and the danger we’re facing is clear.

And all through February and March, Matt Pottinger, the deputy NSC (National Security Council) adviser, had been advocating for masks. And he was the only one in the White House who wore one. Finally in, I think it was April 3, the CDC swung around and recommended mask wearing in public after initially saying masks weren’t necessary.

If you look back at public health statements about masks, Dr. Fauci said that it wasn’t important for Americans to be wearing masks. And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad.

2021-02-12 23:17:08+00:00,20,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines on Friday about how to safely reopen schools — outlining the precautions that help mitigate the spread of Covid-19 as students go back to classrooms.

The general conclusion is that schools can safely reopen with proper precautions. But the CDC’s guidelines are only advisory, walking schools through what kinds of precautions would help based on the level of community spread. “I don’t think I have the authority to demand that schools reopen,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a phone call with reporters, explaining that her job is to provide guidance for how to make reopening as safe as possible.

The recommendations come as reports of problems among school-aged children, including learning loss and mental health crises, continue to mount. At the same time, more research suggests kids aren’t at high risk of Covid-19, and schools aren’t superspreading sites. That’s driven more experts to argue that the benefits of closing schools aren’t worth the costs.

The CDC pointed to five major steps schools can take to safely reopen: universal masking, physical distancing, consistent handwashing and other respiratory etiquette (like covering your cough), cleaning school facilities, and Covid-19 testing and contact tracing.

The CDC highlighted masking and physical distancing as top priorities for in-person teaching. It also advised schools to take more of these steps, and implement them more aggressively, if Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in the community surrounding schools, based on color-coded “phases.”

Walensky described the steps as “layers,” which are more effective if they’re all working together. Throughout Covid-19, experts have used the analogy of stacking slices of Swiss cheese: Holes might show up at each layer, but extra layers make it more likely those holes are fully covered.

The CDC also pointed to several strategies, beyond the five major steps, that could help make schools safer. Schools could improve ventilation — even just by opening doors or windows. They could cancel extracurricular events, particularly those that are indoors. They could vaccinate teachers, with state governments possibly prioritizing teachers over other groups if it’s deemed necessary to reopen schools more quickly.

Walensky said, though, that vaccinating teachers isn’t necessary to reopen — echoing past remarks she’s made.

The CDC also put some of the responsibility on the broader community around schools: If the coronavirus is raging outside school walls, it’s much more likely to creep into schools — perhaps forcing them to close down. “In short, success in preventing the introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools is connected to and facilitated by preventing transmission in the broader community,” the CDC’s “Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools through Phased Mitigation” noted.

CDC officials previously hinted at the broad strokes of the guidelines in an earlier article for JAMA. In that analysis, CDC researchers concluded that there’s now solid evidence schools can safely reopen — but with the right precautions. In one study of 17 K-12 schools in rural Wisconsin with strong adherence to masking and other steps, there were only seven cases of Covid-19 due to in-school transmission over 13 weeks.

The CDC cautioned that new scientific evidence or developments, including new variants of the coronavirus, could lead it to alter its recommendations.

A big hold-up to all of this is money. While cloth masks and opening a door are relatively cheap steps for schools to take, more aggressive interventions, like thorough testing and contact tracing or improving ventilation systems, can cost schools a lot of money — at a time when school districts as well as local and state governments may face budget cuts as a result of the weakened economy.

The federal government enacted nearly $70 billion for K-12 schools in relief packages last year. President Joe Biden has called for an additional $130 billion to help schools reopen as part of his broader economic relief package, but Congress hasn’t passed the proposal yet.

That, then, may be the next hurdle to a wide reopening of schools: They now have the CDC guidance, but they may not have the cash on hand to fully implement it.

2021-02-12 16:20:06+00:00,11,"There’s genuinely good news on Covid-19: America’s vaccination campaign has improved at a steady clip in the last month, with the US hitting the kinds of numbers it needs to end the country’s outbreak this year, maybe even this summer.

According to Our World in Data, the US first breached the weekly average of 1 million doses a day on January 23. Less than three weeks later, on February 11, the country hit 1.6 million a day.

This meets both the goals set by President Joe Biden, who initially called for 1 million shots a day and then later revised his goal to 1.5 million shots a day.

That doesn’t mean the US is in the clear. Many experts argued Biden’s goals haven’t been ambitious enough. To get the US to herd immunity — when enough of the US population is immune so the virus no longer poses a major threat — by the end of the summer, America likely needs to hit an average of 2 million or 3 million doses a day.

America’s possible vaccine futures

Consider the following possibilities, assuming a herd immunity threshold of 80 percent (which could be too low or too high) and all vaccines continue to require two doses (which now seems unlikely):

At 1.6 million shots a day, the US would reach herd immunity by mid-December.

At 2 million shots a day, the US would reach herd immunity by mid-October.

At 3 million shots a day, the US would reach herd immunity by the end of July.

At 5 million shots a day (woo!), the US would reach herd immunity by the end of May.

There are several things that could speed this all up in the coming months. The Biden administration and drug companies could succeed in pumping out more vaccine doses (which already seems to be happening). Government and private actors could improve their vaccine rollouts to get more shots in arms faster. Other vaccines will almost certainly come to the market that only require one shot — Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine is already working through the last stage of federal approval.

In other words, the numbers above could be pessimistic.

Still, there are several problems that could slow things down. As vaccine efforts scale up, there could be new supply shortages and bottlenecks that take too long to overcome (as happened with Covid-19 testing). Maybe local and state officials can’t improve their rollouts quickly enough. A vaccine for children may not be approved this year. If enough people resist getting a vaccine, herd immunity could be difficult to reach. Perhaps it turns out the vaccines don’t protect against spread — they’re currently only proven to prevent illness and death — and reaching herd immunity is impossible.

Most alarming to experts: New variants of the coronavirus could arise, even worse than those that have appeared in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil so far. If new variants manage to overcome the current vaccines, they could require at the very least a booster shot — further slowing down the rollout by adding yet another dose — or require producing new vaccines altogether.

Concerns about the new variants are one of the reasons experts are calling for speed. Obviously, speeding up the vaccine rollout saves lives — with more than 2,500 still dying from Covid-19 a day — and gets life back to normal more quickly (hopefully before the next school year). But prolonging the pandemic also increases the risk of another variant: The longer the coronavirus is spreading and replicating within humans, the likelier it is, during its millions of replications, to mutate into a scarier form that widely spreads.

So it’s very welcome news that America’s vaccine rollout has consistently improved over the past few weeks. But that progress needs to continue and even speed up — or the US risks making its Covid-19 outbreak even worse.

2021-02-12 15:57:50+00:00,26,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

Most states are gradually expanding vaccine eligibility, production of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is increasing, and new studies show good results for additional vaccine candidates as well.

The news on the Covid-19 vaccine front of late has been quite good — perhaps so good that our perspective on the fight against the pandemic may be getting a little warped.

Case in point: the media coverage and public reception of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. Results from its trials were released last week. According to the company, it should be able to deliver 100 million doses in the first half of this year. But this good news hasn’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanied announcements about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Perhaps that’s because in its clinical trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy number — the percentage of cases prevented entirely — of 66 percent. Compared against the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine and the 94.1 rate for Moderna’s, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine simply doesn’t look as good.

But in another sense, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial results were incredibly encouraging. The same trial showed that J&J’s vaccine makes Covid-19 cases much milder, meaning you might still get sick but you are much less likely to be hospitalized or die. Indeed, on that front, the J&J vaccine performs just as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, a fact that seems to have been undersold in news coverage about it.

To put J&J’s effectiveness in another context, think about the flu. Flu vaccines mostly don’t prevent you from getting sick with the flu but instead make the flu much less awful if you catch it and less fatal for at-risk populations. A Covid-19 vaccine that was similar to that — one that made you much less likely to be hospitalized or die, and made the disease milder — would still be enough to help bring the pandemic to an end and give us back our lives.

That’s exactly what we have with the current crop of vaccines, including the three that haven’t been received as well as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. No one who got two doses in clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines has been hospitalized or died, and the same holds true for the new vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Novavax (which haven’t yet been approved in the US). Each of the vaccines has demonstrated very high protection against severe Covid-19 in trials.

So why aren’t we talking about that?

How “efficacy” became the measure of vaccine success

The vaccines developed against Covid-19 can protect people in three ways. First, they can make the vaccinated person less likely to catch the disease. That’s called “efficacy.” It’s the number that made the headlines when Pfizer and Moderna results came out this fall — 95 percent and 94.1 percent efficacy, respectively. For every 20 people in the control group to develop symptoms of Covid-19, only one in the vaccinated group did.

That’s an incredible achievement, and it’s what’s gotten most of the attention in the reporting on the vaccines. But it has overshadowed discussion of the other two ways a vaccine against Covid-19 can protect people.

The second is that the vaccines seem to make vaccinated people less likely to transmit the disease; new research suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do this, too, though imperfectly (so you should still be cautious around unvaccinated people).

And the third way the vaccines can protect people is by ensuring that when a vaccinated person does get the disease, they experience a mild case and are not likely to require hospitalization or be at risk of dying.

This last finding is a big deal. As long as vaccines can make sure that Covid-19, even if you get it, isn’t very bad, we can use them to chart our way out of the pandemic. But this effect of the vaccines has been largely neglected.

Now, there’s a reason headlines have focused on the efficacy of preventing all disease rather than severe disease: It’s what the earliest clinical trials were primarily set up to study.

Every clinical trial defines in advance a primary clinical endpoint: the outcome researchers are primarily focused on studying. The study is designed to have a large enough sample size to detect differences in this primary outcome between the trial group and the placebo group. For the vaccine trials, the primary clinical endpoint has largely been symptomatic Covid-19 infection (however mild or severe), or, in some cases, a positive Covid-19 PCR test.

It makes sense for the studies to set that endpoint. Designing a study to measure rare events like hospitalization or death is much harder than designing a study to measure relatively common events like infection. Covid-19 is a scary disease, but less than 1 percent of people who get it will die from it. That means that a study designed with death from Covid-19 as a primary clinical endpoint would need to be enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of participants. Pinning down the exact frequency of rare events requires a lot of data, and vaccine developers could only include so many people in their first clinical trials because recruiting and coordinating participants is expensive and time-consuming.

So instead, most studies primarily measure how many cases of Covid-19 the vaccines prevent. They do collect data on hospitalizations and deaths, but it’s not the primary outcome their studies are designed to measure, and that has been reflected in press releases, media coverage, and the popular understanding of how well the vaccines work.

As it happens, that data on hospitalizations and deaths looks really good. Indeed, there have been zero cases of hospitalization or death in clinical trials for all of these vaccines. But we hear about that less partly because the studies weren’t designed with that outcome in mind.

This focus on preventing cases, rather than preventing cases as well as hospitalizations and deaths, may have led to the sentiment that the new, unapproved vaccines are worse, and that it’s okay that the US isn’t expediting their approval and distribution because people would rather get the better vaccines anyway. This line of reasoning would be understandable if some vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death and some are only 60 percent effective. But in this instance, it’s a mistake, since all of the vaccines are indistinguishably effective by this metric.

The focus on studying efficacy, instead of studying hospitalization and death, affects major policy calls.

South Africa suspended its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a new study found that the vaccine had very low — potentially zero — efficacy against the variant strain of the disease that predominates in the country. Obviously, that finding was really bad news for the AstraZeneca vaccine. But less widely broadcast was the fact that no one in the study got seriously ill or was hospitalized from Covid-19 (no one in the placebo group did, either; the study was small and didn’t contain at-risk people).

Now, let’s be clear: While other studies have convincingly demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against hospitalization and death, it seems to work less well against the South African virus variant, and that might well mean it works less well to prevent hospitalization and death as well. One crucial caveat here is that the study population was young; we would not have expected many hospitalizations or any deaths within that age group. So it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine has very limited usefulness against the new strain. Or it could be that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers very strong protection against severe disease from the new strain. The study was not set up to answer that question, so we simply don’t know.

In that regard, South Africa’s decision to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout based on the discouraging data makes some sense. But countries that have focused on hospitalization and death statistics, rather than efficacy statistics, have made the opposite call.

“I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, defending Britain’s continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Countries face tough choices here, and their leaders would be able to make a vastly more informed decision if there had been a study with sufficient statistical power — a lot more participants — to detect whether the vaccine is protecting against hospitalization and death. As it is, the understandable focus on efficacy simply doesn’t give us much information on this essential question.

The communications challenge of vaccine statistics

In the past few weeks, some public health experts have started working to change the conversation on vaccines to focus on the key hospitalization and death numbers. One person leading this effort is Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tweeted on January 31:

Am often asked about different vaccines and their efficacy



Each trials tracks, reports efficacy differently



Currently, we have preliminary results for Novavax and J&J



But what numbers matter? What should you look for?



Here's one set of data to track. In a simple table pic.twitter.com/9m2OBgqcla — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) February 1, 2021

One note about this data: It refers only to the clinical trials. Now that the vaccine is out in the world, we’re getting real-world data. The news is still good: 700,000 people in Israel have been vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and there have in fact been a few hospitalizations — 16, to be precise, for a rate of 0.002 percent — and no deaths.

Jha’s message was widely shared, but efficacy still continues to be the statistic that people fixate on.

Communications about severe disease and hospitalization face an uphill battle. Efficacy is much easier to explain — do you get sick or not? For severe disease, on the other hand, many studies have slightly different benchmarks for severity. And while right now there have been zero hospitalizations and zero deaths by anyone vaccinated in the clinical trials for any of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, it doesn’t mean those outcomes are guaranteed. (Again, in Israel, 0.002 percent have been hospitalized so far — that’s very, very low, but it’s not zero.)

Furthermore, as the pandemic stretches into its second year, we’re all desperate for certainty. “This study simply didn’t collect enough data to tell us what we hoped to learn” is not the answer any of us are looking for. The efficacy of the vaccines is known; their effectiveness against hospitalization and death is known to be very high but not pinned down for certain, especially not against the South African variant. All of those pose extraordinary challenges for public health officials and the media to communicate.

But a shift from a focus on efficacy to a focus on improved outcomes is essential for good vaccine decision-making. Moderna and Pfizer can’t produce enough mRNA vaccines alone to end the pandemic, so the public embrace of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — and potentially the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which we’re waiting to learn more on — might make a huge difference for whether things start to get back to normal in the US in April or in August.

2021-02-11 19:40:07+00:00,18,"Many Americans are eager to get the Covid-19 vaccine as quickly as possible. But that inevitably means there are scammers ready to use the internet to take advantage of these vaccine seekers to steal their money and personal information.

Similar to earlier in the pandemic, when fraudsters flooded the internet with ads for sketchy “cures,” bogus Covid-19 tests, and scarce personal protective equipment, online schemers are now selling fake vaccine appointments and knockoff vaccine cards. (These cards document the date that vaccinated people received their doses, the manufacturer of their vaccine, and its batch number; they’re seen as a record of vaccination.)

Vaccine schemes are alarming. In late January, one man in Washington state was arrested after advertising fake Covid-19 vaccines online for as much as $1,000, and even injected people with an unknown substance, according to the Department of Justice, which is investigating these types of fraud cases.

“We’re not surprised scammers are taking advantage of this opportunity because each of the states are rolling out the vaccine a little bit differently,” Sandra Guile of the Better Business Bureau, a nonprofit that focuses on consumer and marketplace trust, told Recode. The organization has warned people that posting images of their vaccine cards on social media — in order to celebrate their inoculation — is only making things worse. Not only are these images making it easier to copy the cards, but social media users are also exposing their personal information and making themselves more vulnerable to identity theft.

People are selling fake vaccine cards online

The target audience for fake vaccine cards is people who think the cards might help them move around and travel more quickly — or avoid getting vaccinated. Tracy Walker, who lives in Hawaii, told Recode that one of her neighbors has been using their personal Facebook page to offer others fake vaccination cards, which were — according to the post, which was viewed by Recode — “[p]rinted on cardstock with laser.”

Right now, these cards are primarily being used as a way for people to record their own vaccination histories, and the card does remind users to keep it handy. It’s possible that this card might be used as proof of inoculation for other purposes sometime in the future.

Walker said she reported the post as “a fraud or scam” to Facebook, only to receive a notice that the post did not violate Facebook’s rules. She said she also reported the post to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and her police department (who reported it to the state health department). The post is still up as of publication time. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about this post.

Related Coronavirus scammers are flooding social media with fake cures and tests

”If that’s something you have to do to be able to move about your life, assume the scammers are going to create a scam around it,” says Kristin Judge, of the Cybercrime Support Network, pointing to both fake Covid-19 vaccination cards and fake Covid-19 test results that have popped up amid the pandemic.

These schemes are showing up in different corners of the internet, including on eBay, in Google ads, and on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. On Twitter, Recode found at least one account purporting to sell vaccines and another selling vaccination cards. Twitter did not provide comment on these accounts.

Chad Anderson, a senior researcher at the cybersecurity threat intelligence firm DomainTools, where he’s been regularly tracking vaccine-related websites throughout the pandemic, told Recode he thinks that the fake card business is only likely to bloom. He’s already seen them being advertised on everything from Shopify-supported shops to the dark web.

“You can just go to Instagram and siphon off people’s batch numbers and just put it on your own fake vaccine card,” he told Recode. “In the US today, we are relying on these cards. They’re extremely easy to fake. Anyone can print one out with the right cardstock.”

Authorities, including the CDC, told Recode they’re aware of the problem, and a spokesperson for the inspector general’s office at the Health and Human Services Department said it has received several reports of scams involving fraudulent vaccine cards. “It is unconscionable that scammers would prey on people’s fear and use the ongoing public health crisis for personal gain,” the representative told Recode.

The World Health Organization added that fake vaccine paperwork can be especially dangerous because it’s unlikely to be reported to national health authorities, and can exacerbate the spread of disease.

And these fakes aren’t just popping up on social media. On eBay, at least one seller had sold nearly 60 “4 packs” of fake Covid-19 vaccination cards (for $35 each), according to a posting on the site, which was viewed by Recode before the platform removed it. After Recode asked about them, eBay also took down another post selling fake “vaccination exemption” cards. Company spokesperson Ashley Settle said the company has been taking down vaccine card sales and is using both manual searches and technology to find the fakes when they’re posted to the site.

Google also took down ads it was running for two websites that purported to sell such cards after Recode reached out to the company. One website using these ads offered a four-pack of Covid-19 vaccine cards for $50, while another claimed to sell a “proof card” for both Covid-19 vaccinations and antibodies. “Early on we implemented our sensitive event policy for Covid-19, blocking most ads referencing the virus, to protect people from bad actors attempting to capitalize on it,” a Google spokesperson told Recode, adding that the company is adapting its approach as it continues to intercept ads for scams.

Some scammers are even calling up seniors in the US, requesting personal information in exchange for a special Covid-19 Medicare card — a card that is not a legitimate Medicare benefit — warned Jennifer Stewart, a senior director of fraud investigation at BlueCross BlueShield Massachusetts.

Online vaccination scams are fueling theft of personal and financial information

Fake vaccine cards are just one example of an array of online vaccine scams. Some schemes simply advertise fake vaccines on social media, notes Timothy Mackey, a UC San Diego professor who studies the online drug market.

Other efforts involve fake vaccine appointment registration websites — and email phishing schemes that promise vaccine appointments that turn out to be fake — that exist to steal people’s money and personal information.

“Some of them are directly trying to collect money from you,” explains Stewart. “Others are simply trying to collect your health insurance and/or financial information so that they can either bill your insurance for fraudulent treatments or prescriptions, or sell your information on the dark web, and there are huge networks on the dark web that sell this information.”

“You’ll get to them and they might have the seal of the state on it. They’ll have information. They try to make them look as plausible as possible, though rarely do they exactly match the legitimate site,” she adds.

The vaccine rollout varies widely depending on where you live, which can add a lot of confusion to the process and make it easier to fall victim to a scam. So as vaccinations continue in the United States, and even speed up, it’s important to keep your eyes open for potential scams and fakes, and avoid sharing personal information before double-checking the legitimacy of the website you’re on or an email you receive.

There are things to watch for that the Federal Trade Commission says should give you pause. No one should be asking you for money to get the vaccine early — or reserving a spot on a waitlist — and you should avoid any vaccine offers that ask for a credit card number, bank account information, or your Social Security number. If you’re looking for a real vaccine appointment, and to check if you’re eligible, it’s best to visit your local public health department’s website and go from there.

2021-02-11 15:50:03+00:00,21,"One brisk day this past November, first graders in my daughter’s school bundled up and headed out for lunch — not to the cafeteria, but instead out the doors and into the school’s backyard. There, seated on upside-down buckets at makeshift wood-plank tables by the school’s garden and chicken coop, kids lowered their masks and nibbled on home lunches and school-provided sandwiches. For recess, they played in the street next to the school, closed to traffic as part of New York’s citywide initiative permitting schools to use outdoor space to help fight the spread of Covid-19.

For my daughter, a chance to interact with her peers after a traumatic and isolating spring has been life-changing. When Covid-19 abruptly shuttered schools across the US last spring, my then 5-year-old was one of millions of students forced to school through Zoom classes.

We were blessed to have high-speed internet and guardians to troubleshoot tech issues, all necessary resources for schooling during Covid-19, yet resources that so many kids lack. Still, my daughter, like so many other young kids, was restless and visibly frustrated by the experience and did not — as her teacher succinctly put it — “do screens.”

So when New York City launched its grand hybrid experiment last fall, allowing all public schools to submit plans for outdoor classrooms using school grounds and nearby streets and parks to allow for pandemic-friendly spacing of students, we eagerly signed our daughter up for in-person learning. Out of the 1,600 public schools in New York City, 826 applied to integrate outdoor learning and 798 were approved — our daughter’s school was not one of them.

Over the summer, I decided to pull my daughter from that school and put her in a progressive public school that emphasizes hands-on learning, to maximize the time she would spend outside as well as learning to care for the school’s farm. Students wear masks at all times, except when they eat — which always happens outdoors unless there is severe or frigid weather. For winter months, the school organized clothing drives so that all students have access to adequate winter clothing.

It hasn’t been a totally smooth ride in NYC’s public school system, but so far there has been no proof of any Covid-19 transmission at my daughter’s new school. She has never been happier, and is learning how to garden and to “take care of the planet” alongside more traditional skills like math and reading. We love her school’s outdoor integration. But it’s made me wonder: Once Covid-19 is no longer a threat, why can’t this model represent the future of education?

Even before the pandemic, I’d been a staunch advocate for outdoor education. As a journalist, I covered Green Schoolyards America, a Berkeley, California-based nonprofit that advocates for policies that favor learning outdoors, and also provides tools and how-to guides for schools that wish to “green” their school grounds, replacing the asphalt with trees, grass, and plants. The case for greening school grounds is rooted in science that shows kids are better able to regulate their emotions when they have access to nature.

“Just looking at trees reduces stress levels and increases our ability to pay attention,” says Sharon Danks, who founded Green Schoolyards America in 2011. Danks cites research by William Sullivan, a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Illinois, that shows schools “with no trees leave test score points on the table.”

Covid-19 has added urgency to a trend that has been taking off around the world, particularly in countries like Scotland, Brazil, and Germany. Scotland requires some outdoor learning in their national curricula, and Berlin has greened the majority of its schoolyards, part of a plan to mitigate stormwater runoff which can cause flooding and pollute local waterways. In 2010, Danks co-founded an international green schoolyard organization called the International School Grounds Alliance, which currently has 80 board members in 27 countries. Swedish preschoolers spend an average of six hours outside during school every day in fair weather, and 90 minutes during the winter.

But the upside of outdoor schooling is not just learning development. There are also broader climate implications — school grounds account for around 2 million acres of land across the States, Danks says — land that, if managed correctly, could be a valuable tool in our efforts to fight climate change. “More people use school land in California every day than visit Yosemite in an entire year, yet we don’t invest in that land in the same way,” says Danks. As with all climate issues, it’s also about equity — lower-income areas tend to have more pavement and less nature and are thus more vulnerable to heat waves and flooding than wealthier zip codes.

Without a coherent national vision for green schools, progress in the US has lagged behind other countries. But as research has shown that ventilation is key to fighting the viral transmission of Covid-19, interest from schools that want to teach outdoors has seen an uptick: Over 1,000 people attended a webinar that Green Schoolyards co-hosted this past June.

Since then, Green Schoolyards has convened a number of working groups devoted to helping schools take learning outdoors. Weather is commonly cited as an issue — it’s too hot in Phoenix, too cold in Minneapolis — but Portland, Maine’s public-school system has successfully opened 156 outdoor classrooms at 17 schools using a chunk of money from the CARES Act stimulus last year. The district ordered hundreds of hats, gloves, snow pants, and fleece to be cut up and used as neck warmers and blankets for cold weather days. Educators there cite an unofficial GSY mantra: There is no bad weather, only bad clothing.

But the case for outdoor schooling extends beyond the pandemic and improved mental health. Here in New York City, 74 percent of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch, and one in 10 are homeless — just as in much of the country, with free meals and shelter, schools provide far more than just education. One way to help ensure that schools are to remain open and safe for students and educators alike is to green them, creating safe, outdoor spaces for instruction, meals, or break time.

NYC’s Department of Education has largely left it up to individual schools to draft their own plans, with predictably patchwork results. As a result, it’s hard to know exactly how many schools are offering outdoor instruction and recreation space. Some public schools do not even have their own yards or the ability to close neighboring streets, while a school like my daughter’s has a garden, composting shed, chickens, and the like. The elementary school I attended as a kid, in the West Village, recently installed a green roof, but schools like that are few and far between. One potential solution would be to combine all PTA funds into a single grant to be equitably distributed to schools, to provide for warm clothing, tents, and other supplies that schools need to get kids learning outdoors.

There is pushback, too, of course. Hoping that our daughter’s previous school would apply for the outdoor hybrid program, I brought up the idea to our class’s parents. A panicked email from a class parent laid out all the reasons why outdoor learning would be a disaster, citing safety concerns, distractions from New York City’s busy streets, cold weather, and the burden of kids having to carry supplies to and from the building. It wasn’t just parents — teachers had concerns as well, many of them involving issues of practicality and inclement weather. Also, where will the little kids pee, one person asked.

I understand these concerns completely, but also feel that the benefits outweigh the cons. Not only is it far safer in an era of Covid-19 to hold classes outside, but studies show clear mental health benefits when kids spend time outdoors on a regular basis. For safety, at our daughter’s school, parents take turns volunteering for “barricade watch,” to monitor the street where the kids play, and to allow emergency traffic to pass through. (Not all parents have time to do this, of course.)

And if you’re worried about weather: Most classes can still take place indoors during the winter, with plans to take some instruction outside in the spring. No one advocates teaching outside during a major snowstorm — when it’s necessary to teach indoors or remotely, then schools should do just that. But that would be the fallback option as opposed to the default.

Detailed plans and blueprints for schools that want to provide outdoor learning experiences already exist — and at different levels of investment. At a minimum, schools can purchase picnic tables, tents, and sheds to store school supplies.

School systems with larger budgets can remake their school grounds to more closely match Danks’s vision: replacing asphalt with plants and soil and more fully integrating teaching with the natural environment. This plan will not come cheap, but we now know that learning outdoors, in nature, is essential for kids’ social and physical development. With Covid-19 in the mix, the stakes have never been higher. And greening our schoolyards will pay for itself over time in climate benefits, energy costs, and the mental health of our children.

My daughter’s favorite time of day is when she gets to go outside, whether that be to eat lunch, play, or “work” in the garden. And I feel better about sending her to school during this terrible time, knowing she is spending as much of the day getting dirty and learning about the natural world as she is studying the basics of math and reading. But best of all, she comes home excited about school again — and to me that is the greatest gift of all.

2021-02-10 23:44:06+00:00,15,"Editor’s note, January 10, 2022: This article was originally published in February 2021, and public health guidance around masking to prevent Covid-19 transmission may have shifted. For Vox’s latest coverage on the pandemic, see here.

My favorite face mask is a sleek black cloth number — it goes with everything, it doesn’t chafe my face, and it’s sold in a relatively affordable three-pack, so I always have a backup. I have a whole collection of cloth masks, like you probably do, cobbled together at random, in bright colors and patterns, generally homemade by an assortment of people in my life.

Yet, as we’ve slipped into allowing our face coverings to project our tastes while they protect us, there’s another element of style that’s often forgotten: fit. And fit is incredibly important when it comes to how effective our masks are.

Tons of celebrities have been seen out with their masks underneath their noses. Notably, members of Congress who promote masking up have been seen pulling up their sliding masks in public.

Cloth masks sometimes lend themselves to poor etiquette: Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) slipped his down to sneeze into his hand on C-SPAN, which is, to put it plainly, horrifying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is known to have masks that match her outfits but was once photographed in a conversation with George Floyd’s brother, mask hanging down below her mouth. And soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden’s mask slipped down his face in the midst of signing an executive action related to Covid-19. It happens to the best of us. Walk around anywhere in pandemic America, and you’ll surely encounter people fiddling with their masks.

But in order to truly protect you, cloth masks need to have a snug fit. And wearing a well-fitted mask might be more important than it’s ever been in the pandemic. As previously reported by Julia Belluz for Vox, a more contagious new variant of Covid-19, known as B.1.1.7, that’s now spreading around the world, should make us even more cautious about our risk of exposure to the virus, especially in indoor spaces.

Mask fit really matters

Proper mask-wearing remains a key factor in preventing the transmission of the coronavirus. A mask slip can leave the wearer extremely vulnerable, as the nasal passage is a common entryway for the virus to get into the body. According to a study in Nature Medicine, the virus attaches to certain proteins found in the nasal passage. There are actually more of these proteins in the nose than in the lungs, making an exposed nose a serious threat. You don’t want any viral particles getting to your nose, so it’s imperative that your mask has a tight fit.

Cloth masks are still fine for the general public to use, experts tell me, so don’t feel like you have to run out and buy a medical-grade mask like an N95. We think about what our masks look like every day, but we are largely ignoring the importance of the proper fit. There’s not enough emphasis on what makes a mask well-fitted and effective — we’ve gotten distracted with design, when really we need to be worrying about how comfortable our masks are and whether or not they are secure enough to rely on.

The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force, a research group based out of Cambridge University, investigates the efficacy and improvement of civilian face masks and fabrics. “What we found through our research is that the actual filtration material is not as important as fit. In order to get any benefit from a high filtration material, you have to have fit,” Eugenia O’Kelly, a PhD student who heads the group, said. O’Kelly emphasized that without highly specialized machinery, there is no way to be 100 percent sure your mask fits, but did have tips for improved fit and protection.

According to her team’s tests, double masking can be helpful. “Keep in mind, you do not end up numerically doubling your protection by layering masks. I have seen a lot of this type of ‘math’ online, but unfortunately, this is not how depth filtration works,” she said. But doubling up can ensure you get a better seal around the nose and mouth than one mask alone that might be a bit too loose. According to the new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released February 10, well-fitted surgical masks or a “cloth and surgical mask combination” can reduced virus transmission by up to 96.5 percent. The director of the CDC has also urged Americans to wear a mask with “two or more layers,” the New York Times reports.

O’Kelly says there are two methods scientists use to find out if a mask fits. “You can have quantitative fitting and qualitative fitting. In quantitative fitting, you are measuring the amount of particles inside and outside of the mask,” she said. Most surgical masks don’t fit tightly enough, or are made of material without sufficient filtration, so they won’t pass.

Quantitative fitting can be expensive because it requires specialized hospital equipment. “More common is qualitative mask fitting,” she said, for which her team is experimenting with using aroma diffusers as a test. If you are wearing a mask and can taste the particles through it, it’s a sign that your mask is ill-fitting.

In order to identify if your mask is good at protecting others, O’Kelly recommends avoiding masks with the following characteristics:

Thin material: If you can see any gaps between the fibers when you hold it to the light, that is a sign that viruses can get through. Single-layer: If your mask only has one (or even two) layers of fabric, the filtration is probably not high. The best masks have multiple layers or have a pocket to insert a filter, such as a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter. Poor fit: Fit is very important in a mask’s success, as you can read about in this recent study. You may not be able to get a mask that fits you perfectly, but the more and larger the gaps you see, the poorer the fit is. This may be more important when protecting the wearer than others. Discomfort: If the mask is very uncomfortable, you may be less likely to wear it correctly, and more likely to touch the outside of the mask or adjust it while out and about.

So how should a mask fit? “The mask should be a good fit over the nose and mouth, but not overly tight to impair breathing. It is not intended to filter out all the air one breathes, but intended to hold back droplets from our mouth from spreading in the air,” George Abraham, the chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine’s Infectious Disease Board, tells me.

There’s not a lot we can do to prevent a mask from falling down — except maybe try to find a mask that fits better.

O’Kelly also recommends doing a fit check, although there is no reliable way to currently assess the fit of fabric masks. “Move your hand around the edges of the mask where it makes contact with your skin and see if you can feel any air. If you feel the air, there is a gap,” she said. But just because a mask has a gap does not mean it’s totally ineffective. It just means it’s not providing the maximum level of protection possible. According to O’Kelly, a fabric mask with fit issues can protect the user from over 50 percent of particles, and well-constructed fabric masks with gaps still can filter over 75 percent of particles.

In a Consumer Reports article, William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, recommends tightening your mask if it slips off your nose. You can adjust the strings and make sure there isn’t any space for air on the sides. Our best bet is selecting a mask that fits properly: snug around the nose and mouth without gaps at the sides. A wire nose bridge can help your mask mold to your face. The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force’s studies have found that a metal nose band can improve fit. However, in less structured or elastic masks, that nose band can also harm performance, so the user has to make a judgment call.

But shouldn’t we just get N95s?

As comforting as it might be that experts say cloth masks are sufficient, the United States is far behind countries like Austria, where the government provides FFP2 masks to citizens, and Taiwan, where the government has been providing citizens with high-quality masks that are probably going to fit better than some of the cloth masks in circulation. Why can’t the same happen here in the United States?

The argument for the government to supply masks is not new. It might do Americans well to have better PPE, but there are a lot of caveats that come with the use of heavy-duty masks like the N95. In an email, Abraham told me that it would be difficult for the government to make sure that everyone had an effective N95. “The wearer needs to be ‘fit-tested’ so that the mask being used is not leaking but forms a good seal on the face, or else the ability of the mask to filter is lost,” he wrote. “As a practical reality, that is not consistently possible with the general public.”

There are ways to test the N95 — “you could place both hands around the rim of the mask, once on the face, and blow hard into it. If you feel air on your hands, you know the mask is not a tight fit,” Abraham explains. But according to experts, it is also not 100 percent accurate.

The N95 masks are a must for health care workers because they’re great for long exposure situations, but they might be excessive for short-term use, according to Abraham. An N95 mask might be more appropriate for a long plane ride, for example, instead of a quick run to the grocery store. “The use of the mask would be inconsistent, without doing a fit check every time,” Abraham said, and it would be “cost-prohibitive and accomplish little.” The government couldn’t regulate the N95 use of every civilian, and the respirators would be rendered useless if not properly fitting.

While the research O’Kelly’s group has done on mask materials is still being peer-reviewed, she says that even a mask with poor fit is better than not wearing one at all. “If you can see a gap at all, your mask is probably not functioning at 100 percent. However, that certainly does not mean the mask is useless if there are gaps.” Any kind of gap can compromise the effectiveness of a mask, so it is important to try to make sure there are no spaces if possible.

So next time you find yourself tugging at your face mask all day, consider finding another style or model that may work better. For extra protection, spend a little more money to get a mask with a pocket to add a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter, and shop around to get multiple masks that you can fit check at home. Mask slipping plagues us, but if we work at it, we can ward off the actual plague.

2021-02-10 21:32:23+00:00,23,"In November, Joseph Osmundson got a call from one of the people in his quarantine pod while he was brining their Thanksgiving turkey. He learned the group’s bubble of safety had burst: A member of their five-person pod was sick. Osmundson, a clinical assistant professor of biology at New York University with a background in studying viruses, had kept his circle running smoothly since May.

“I was so sad. I had bought hundreds of dollars’ worth of food. We had an 18-pound turkey,” Osmundson, who lives with his partner, told me. “I wasn’t mad at my friend. But it was a brutal fall. I was teaching in person, and I was so looking forward to a few days off, too much food, and seeing my pod. When I found out the news, I was in the middle of prepping. And I immediately turned off the stove and went and just laid down on the couch for a half-hour.”

Stories like Osmundson’s aren’t uncommon, though they may not always involve a ruined holiday and two people being forced to consume nearly 20 pounds of turkey.

Since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the guidance from epidemiologists has been to form pods, small groups of people in our lives whom we either live with — partners, children, roommates — or choose to see in person. Pods can help lessen our transmission risk in what’s essentially a numbers game.

The more people we interact with in person, the higher our risk of contracting the coronavirus. Paring down the number of people we interact with reduces that risk. The risk is further reduced when the only people you regularly see indoors also see only you. Pods serve another purpose by allowing us to see friends and socialize instead of facing this pandemic with loneliness and isolation.

Figuring out the people in our pods is an odd exercise in itself. Humans aren’t usually asked to trim our friend groups or consider such questions as, “Is this someone I can trust with my health?” or, “Will this person — who is not my significant other or family member — make sacrifices for me?”

That gets even more complicated for people who are making choices for their children or who already live with family members.

If that weren’t emotionally strange enough, we had to deal with the common reality that sometimes, the people in our pods, those we trust with our health, could be exposed to the virus and, unfortunately, may expose us too. That triggers its own set of complicated feelings of shame, blame, and betrayal — all completely normal reactions considering this completely abnormal set of social circumstances, public health experts told me.

Yet somehow Osmundson acted with grace, even with the giant bird and dashed hopes.

“The thing is — and we all said it — it’s not his fault,” Osmundson said. “We all were like, ‘Oh, my god, is he okay?’ Because he had to quarantine, he was scared. He didn’t break the rules of a pod. He accepted that risk altogether. I don’t regret that. And we all did the right thing to stop transmission.”

I’m not entirely sure I’d be as calm as Osmundson in accepting that kind of news. I don’t think I’m alone. Several people I spoke to had stories about losing friendships, roommates moving out, and the looming risk stressing their relationships. Osmundson was prepared, though, because he’d already written one of the best guides to navigating life in pods.

I wanted to know how we can all be better about our quarantine bubbles, and what happens when they fail. Here’s what I learned.

Everyone should have the hard conversations first

One of my public health sources recommended I talk with Osmundson not only because of his background in virology and biology, but also because Osmundson has what they believe to be the best quarantine pod checklist — a document full of questions about rules, risk factors, and what to do in case there’s an exposure.

The list includes specific, detailed questions: “Are you taking the subway? Only Uber/Lyft? Biking/walking?” and, “What about interactions like doctor appointments or having someone enter your home for repairs and deliveries?” as well as, “How is sex being managed by those having sex outside the pod? What risks are acceptable? What would make people uncomfortable?”

Osmundson said that while creating the checklist, he consulted epidemiologists, public health colleagues with backgrounds in risk mitigation, and HIV/AIDS activists and advocates.

There are some questions on the list that I absolutely haven’t asked and, prior to my conversation with Osmundson, wouldn’t have even thought to ask my podmates. But that’s really the point. Seeing all these questions and rules laid out on paper eliminates any doubt, awkwardness, and gray areas. As the public health experts I talked to explained, these are exactly the types of questions and scenarios, and the level of depth, that potential podmates should be addressing upfront without fear.

“Setting those ground rules upfront [is] one of the ways that you can normalize the process”

“Setting those ground rules upfront [is] one of the ways that you can normalize the process [of trust and risk management], and you can hope they would never introduce it,” Jennifer Balkus, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Washington, told me. “But if you do, then you have something you can fall back on, to say, ‘We’ve already had the hard conversation when it was easy to do so.’”

The less confusion, the better off everyone is. Having everything in writing, public health experts told me, removes the burden of starting an awkward conversation with a podmate and eventually getting to a resolution and an agreement on the types of behavior they are and aren’t comfortable with. This clarity allows for clear action when there’s been an exposure in the pod.

“When there’s been a rupture in the pod or there’s been an exposure or a case — that’s precisely when you need to immediately be 100 percent honest and open,” Osmundson told me.

Don’t think about an exposure as something someone did wrong. It’s not about blame.

Pandemic pod-popping can happen to anyone, even public health experts like Anna Muldoon, a former science policy adviser at the US Department of Health and Human Services and a PhD candidate researching infectious disease and social crises at Arizona State University. Her own pod — made up of other public health scientists — burst during the pandemic, too.

“The first question everyone asks is, ‘Well, how did they get it?’” Muldoon told me. “Like, what did they do wrong? And as someone who has worked on stigmas, that was so frustrating.”

The reaction comes from a place of fear, the thought being that if we know how someone contracted the virus, we can avoid those particular behaviors and keep ourselves safer. It’s a very human and very American way of thinking about disease, Muldoon said.

While normal, that kind of thinking can actually lead to a lot of problems.

Blame makes it seem as though someone was wrong or someone misbehaved, and it can lead to feelings of shame in the person who was exposed. Those feelings could cause someone to not want to get tested or be forthright about their diagnosis, potentially leading to more exposures and putting exponentially more people in the community at risk.

A better way to think about it is to normalize the idea that pod exposure will occur and that pods are designed with this in mind.

Though we may see them as our new social circles, public health experts see pods as more of a tool that helps the health of a community. Pods can lower our own transmission risk, but they can also help us alert others quickly and sufficiently about potential exposure.

“That’s a huge thing that I would say about pods that we haven’t talked about enough, is it’s not just eliminating personal risk and eliminating exposure,” Osmundson told me. “It’s so that when you do, you can immediately contact trace everyone.” It feels bad to burst your bubble, he said, but “it’s worse to have that transmission.”

Osmundson also explained that the US’s failure to conduct adequate contact tracing makes pods integral to the safety of a community. The more people who are quickly notified about exposure, the faster they can quarantine and keep others safe.

“Really trusting the people in your pod requires a different kind of openness than we’re used to”

“This is one of those moments where we’re all having to learn, like about communitarian action and trust,” Muldoon, who initially recommended Osmundson and his checklist, said. “Really trusting the people in your pod requires a different kind of openness than we’re used to. And it also requires a different level of forgiveness and kindness than we sometimes offer to the people in our lives.”

It’s not easy to be better and quash the anger or resentment — again, it’s a completely normal and human reaction. But in terms of public health, being forgiving and focusing on the next steps and moving forward is exponentially more helpful.

The pandemic hasn’t stopped. Conversations with your pod shouldn’t, either.

Osmundson, Balkus, and Muldoon all stressed that as the pandemic continues, so should the conversations and check-ins we have with our podmates. Pod rules are meant to evolve. Cases may rise, as we saw during the holidays, which may lead to stricter measures and require more in-depth conversations. Cases could fall, like they did last summer, which may allow for discussions about outdoor socializing and exercising.

“The rules should change over time,” Osmundson told me. “When the rates of the virus go up in your area, everything you do is higher risk. In the summer in New York, when the rates were so low, [going to a gym] might be a risk you’re willing to take. But in January, when we’re having 5,000 cases a day in our city, that risk of that same behavior is very different. The pod rules are not supposed to be like, ‘We make a contract and that’s it.’”

These conversations should also continue as podmates are vaccinated, since scientists don’t fully know yet whether vaccinated people can transmit the virus.

Perhaps the most important piece of advice these experts have is that even they don’t have a perfect solution when it comes to the broken relationships the pandemic has caused. Quite simply, none of this — surviving a pandemic, changing our habits in a year, cutting people out of our lives, or allowing people into the most vulnerable parts of ours — is easy. And it’s absolutely fine to acknowledge that.

“If you think about it, you just don’t have any tools to deal with this, this kind of stress, right?” Stephanie Cook, an assistant professor of social and behavioral sciences at NYU, told me. “So if it’s thrust upon you, then it’s going to be very, very jolting and hard to survive.

“If you’re experiencing all of these things and you’re not used to it, then it has a very, very detrimental impact on one’s relationships, in terms of their quality of relationships, in terms of the number of arguments they’re going to get into with their partners, so on and so forth,” she added.

Cook said we need to give each other grace, to treat the people in our pods with more respect and truly support them, especially as there’s a natural tendency to withdraw. We’re in a life-changing event, and at times the stress of it may cause us to lose sight of the people helping us get through it.

It’s important to acknowledge the beauty and depth of friendships and relationships we maintain. The constant face time with the people we live with isn’t easy, nor is feeling like you’re policing your friends’ activities, like dates or trips they’re taking. But those things could lead to stronger bonds and deeper friendships built upon our newfound appreciations for trust and vulnerability.

“I think it’s unprecedented. We’ve never, we have not in our lifetime, had an event that makes [seemingly all] social activity put you at risk for a deadly virus,” Osmundson told me. “I think what I’ve noticed isn’t necessarily that I have fewer friends, but the friendships are deeper. I have definitely grown in trust and intimacy with my podmates. It’s familial in a way it wasn’t quite before.”",voxdotcom,"['wrong', 'public', 'pods', 'pod', 'doing', 'trust', 'americans', 'risk', 'osmundson', 'health', 'rules', 'pandemic', 'told']",0

2021-02-10 19:00:02+00:00,6,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-10 11:01:35+00:00,33,"February 6 marks the anniversary of the first American death from the coronavirus.

Since then, well over 400,000 Americans have died from complications related to Covid-19. It’s likely many more will die before we’re finally over the hump. It goes without saying that no matter who was in charge last year, this pandemic would have killed lots of people. But it’s also true that bad leadership costs many lives, and we’ll never know for sure how many could have been spared.

The story of America’s failure is long and complicated. When the full history is finally written, the depth of those failures will likely shock even those of us who have followed it closely in real time.

For now, the closest thing we have to a comprehensive account of America’s botched response to the coronavirus is Lawrence Wright’s sweeping story in the New Yorker. Published in December, just a few days before the year ended, the story documents what happened and when, and who was responsible — a staggering piece of reporting that goes as deep as anything written thus far.

Wright highlights three moments at which America could’ve have gotten things right but, for various reasons, didn’t. It’s as depressing as it is illuminating. I reached out to Wright, who also wrote The End of October, a 2020 novel about a pandemic originating in Asia (seriously), to talk about those three pivotal moments.

Beyond diagnosing what went wrong, I asked Wright what the federal government could have done differently and if he thinks a competent administration with a serious plan might’ve saved hundreds of thousands of lives. He explained what happened in exquisite detail, and I have to say, it’s maddening. This was indeed a tragedy and, as Wright suggests, one of the greatest failures in the history of American governance.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You say there are three moments in which America’s Covid-19 response might have gone in a very different direction. Walk me through the first moment, in which China basically attempts to hide the scale of the pandemic in those early days.

Lawrence Wright

Right, the first moment occurs when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke to George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 3, 2020. This was already a fraught moment. Gao had really just started to discover the scale of the thing, and part of the dilemma was that in China people are afraid to report things up the chain. He was basically reading about what was happening on social media.

The tragic part about this moment is that Gao could not invite the American CDC team to come to China and help investigate the outbreak, and that set us back enormously. Redfield is sure that, had the CDC team been able to visit China at that point, we would’ve discovered that there was asymptomatic transmission, something we didn’t know at that point. This was already something that was being talked about in medical circles in China. It wouldn’t have been a secret. But the US, and really the rest of the world, did not figure this out until late February or early March. And had they known that, the strategy for dealing with this outbreak would have been entirely different.

“This was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad”

Sean Illing

Can the CDC be faulted for this, or is there little they could’ve done in the face of China’s intransigence?

Lawrence Wright

No, the CDC alone could not have done much. But the American government could have made it a much bigger issue, and we simply didn’t do it. People sat back and took the Chinese at their word. And look, China’s behavior at the beginning of this outbreak is nefarious. But the countries that knew China well — for instance, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan — they took precautions because they didn’t believe the Chinese assurances. And unfortunately, we didn’t do that. That was the first setback in our response and what I’d call strike one.

Sean Illing

Did you get any good answers as to why we sat back? It can’t be as simple as naiveté, can it? Or was the US government just scared to death of antagonizing China?

Lawrence Wright

All of those things were at play. There was absolutely a fear of antagonizing China. A great example of that is that we wanted to get our diplomats and businesspeople out of Wuhan, and China threw a fit. There was a “How dare you!” quality to their reaction. And in order to placate the Chinese, we sent these 747s over that we were going to use to pick up our citizens, and we stuffed it full of PPE gear, something like 18 tons of it. And we did it purely to mollify the Chinese.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the second moment.

Lawrence Wright

The second one was the fumble on the testing. The fault lies principally with CDC. But also, the FDA plays a role in this tragedy. The CDC was always the gold standard for public health agencies around the world. And one of the things they do is, they create tests for diseases. And they’ve been very good at that in the past. And of course, they were under terrific pressure in this moment and that in turn led to them taking some shortcuts.

So there are typically two main elements in a normal test kit, or two parts to the test. One is the primers and probes, as they call them, which detect the presence of viral antibodies. And the other is a piece of RNA that represents the virus. And these two things go together to make a test kit. Normally, you have them manufactured in separate facilities because it contaminates if you have them both in the same house. So the CDC took a shortcut. And they sent out the test kits knowing that it failed their own internal quality check. The fail rate was around 30 percent. But they sent out the kits anyway and they were totally unreliable.

Sean Illing

Wait, how the hell does that happen?

Lawrence Wright

The CDC didn’t know if it was a design problem or a manufacturing problem. They couldn’t figure it out. So the FDA sent this guy, Timothy Stenzel, down to Atlanta, the CDC headquarters. And it was immediately apparent what had happened. The lab was contaminated. They were processing samples of the test in the same room where they were making the test. So live virus samples were in the same room. And a mistake like that, you just can’t imagine the Centers for Disease Control doing that.

But there was another thing going on. There were three elements in the primers and probes, numbered one, two, and three. Numbers one and two detected against the SARS-CoV-2 and number three detected any coronavirus, in case it mutated. That was the element that failed. The test worked, except for that third element. All they had to do was to eliminate that third element and you would have a valid test. And the FDA refused to bend on this authorization, for weeks. We lost all of February because of the incompetence and inertia on the part of the CDC and FDA.

Sean Illing

You say we “lost all of February,” but what does that mean exactly? Can we even begin to speculate how many lives this dithering and incompetence cost?

Lawrence Wright

Well, there are models that show, at every step along the way, had the Chinese been more forthcoming earlier, had the Chinese shut down Wuhan earlier, had we gotten the test out sooner, it would have made an enormous difference in terms of the spread of the virus and the number of lives lost. We can’t say for sure, but had these things gone differently, we would be dealing with a fraction of what we’re facing now.

“More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured”

Sean Illing

Did anyone at the CDC or the FDA explain to you why in the world they sent out test kits knowing they were faulty?

Lawrence Wright

I asked Redfield about it and he said someone violated protocol. And that’s about it. They have an internal examination. No one’s really been held accountable. No one’s been fired. No one’s been fingered. But it’s pretty clear that it happened in the lab of Stephen Lindstrom, who was overseeing the test. And so far, there’s been no accountability for the failure in CDC.

I have to say that there’s been no real accountability at the FDA either. Because the FDA could have been responsive to the fact that the test obviously worked if you removed this third element. And they eventually did get it right, but they could have done it weeks earlier and, as I said, the consequences of this delay were enormous.

Sean Illing

There’s a crucial moment, on January 23, when a physician (Dr. Rick Bright) from HHS (Health and Human Services) tells various Trump officials, including Secretary Alex Azar, that the “virus might already be here,” and you write that the Trump people “seemed determined to ignore” the news. Does that mean they literally ignored it or does it mean they kept searching for “experts” to tell them what they wanted to hear?

Lawrence Wright

Both of those things were going on. They didn’t want to hear the news. They didn’t want to hear any bad news. But also there was this longing for someone to come along and say, “This is not a problem. It’s going away. And if you do nothing, we’ll be fine.” And Scott Atlas served that purpose.

Sean Illing

Wait, who is Scott Atlas?

Lawrence Wright

Scott Atlas is a neuroradiologist from Stanford who had been on Fox News a lot, saying that we needed to open up the schools, which is a legitimate debate. But he was advocating for “herd immunity,” which is this idea that when enough people have been either vaccinated or infected, the population at large is no longer susceptible to the spread of the disease. The main concept of herd immunity is, let people get sick. We don’t have the vaccine yet. If people get sick, then that will begin to choke off the spread.

The great appeal for the Trump administration was that you can achieve herd immunity by doing nothing. And that became the unspoken policy.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the third moment.

Lawrence Wright

This is, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all. Because in strike one and strike two, the rate of infection in the United States was still seemingly small. We didn’t have the tests, so we didn’t really know. But the sense of threat wasn’t as great. But when March rolls in and then you have New York City going into this horrible first wave, and the danger we’re facing is clear.

And all through February and March, Matt Pottinger, the deputy NSC (National Security Council) adviser, had been advocating for masks. And he was the only one in the White House who wore one. Finally in, I think it was April 3, the CDC swung around and recommended mask wearing in public after initially saying masks weren’t necessary.

If you look back at public health statements about masks, Dr. Fauci said that it wasn’t important for Americans to be wearing masks. And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad. If we had only done as good a job as Vietnam or South Korea, we could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of American lives. And we were supposed to be the country best equipped to deal with the pandemic. We had better resources than any country on earth. And that just makes the failure all the more catastrophic because we could have done a good job. And we did the worst job in the world.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'response', 'lawrence', 'covid19', 'cdc', 'botched', 'job', 'americas', 'masks', 'things', 'failure', 'going', 'say', 'world', 'didnt', 'worst', 'test', 'moment', 'wright']",0

And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad. If we had only done as good a job as Vietnam or South Korea, we could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of American lives. And we were supposed to be the country best equipped to deal with the pandemic. We had better resources than any country on earth. And that just makes the failure all the more catastrophic because we could have done a good job. And we did the worst job in the world.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'response', 'lawrence', 'covid19', 'cdc', 'botched', 'job', 'americas', 'masks', 'things', 'failure', 'going', 'say', 'world', 'didnt', 'worst', 'test', 'moment', 'wright']",0

2021-02-09 15:01:21+00:00,13,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been bad for the United States economy, but not as bad as some experts and economists feared early on in the outbreak. The recovery, though, is uneven — and it’s slowing.

In January, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent, and the country added just 49,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate is lower than it was pre-pandemic, as many Americans left the workforce. America is also still millions of jobs short of where it was pre-pandemic.

“This morning’s employment report revealed a stall in the American job creation machine and underscores how precarious of a situation our economy is in,” Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein said in a White House briefing on Friday. “Lack of job growth is a result of our failure to act appropriately in response to this immense dual crisis, and our economy and our families can’t afford for us to fail to act once again.”

How the country is experiencing the economy varies widely, and how workers are experiencing the pandemic differs, too. Life is much better for the wealthier segment of workers than it is for those at the bottom, and the top-line figures camouflage the realities of what people are dealing with in their day-to-day lives.

But digging in deeper on the numbers is worthwhile. Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard has estimated that for workers in the top wage quartile, unemployment has fallen below 5 percent; meanwhile, for those in the bottom wage quartile, that number is likely more than 20 percent. Many of these workers have access to expanded unemployment insurance, but the system is difficult to navigate. It’s not clear when benefits will end as Congress continues to haggle over more stimulus.

Higher-income (and often white) workers are more often able to work from home. Not only are they less likely to lose money from pandemic job losses, they’re saving money because there are fewer opportunities to spend. Meanwhile, lower-income (and often Black and brown) workers have either been deemed “essential,” meaning they’re putting their health at risk to get paid, or they’re out of work. A restaurant job is hard to come by when so many restaurants aren’t open.

What we’re seeing is a K-shaped economic recovery, one where certain segments of the population are doing much better than everyone else. For those at the top of the K, life — at least as far as having a job — is decent. Those at the bottom, not so much. The Covid-19 pandemic has made the realities of the disparities among workers in America more evident than ever.

“All recessions hit low- and middle-income people harder, they disproportionately hit people of color,” said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the Department of Labor. “Recessions always exacerbate existing inequalities, but this one is just doing that more than we’ve ever seen before.”

Understanding what’s happening to workers during the pandemic entails understanding how uneven the situation is. Black and Latinx workers face a different horizon than white workers, women are experiencing a different scenario than men, and in some cases, the people who can work from home are directly affecting the workers who can’t. If a Manhattan coffee cart guy depends on office workers for business, what happens when those people are now working from their Brooklyn couches?

“The basic story of the K-shaped recovery has just been staring us in the face for a long time,” said Michael Stepner, an economist and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard research project Opportunity Insights. “It’s unrealistic to think that these jobs are going to be restored while the pandemic is raging.”

Vox took a look at seven sets of data that help tell the story of how unevenly American workers are experiencing the current economy. The following charts tell a stark story about inequality in the country — inequality that has been made worse by the pandemic in some of the most vulnerable populations.

The pandemic has slammed Black workers

The unemployment rate for Black workers consistently lags behind white workers, and during the pandemic, that reality has been exacerbated. When the overall unemployment rate spiked to 14.8 percent in April, it was at 14.1 percent for white workers, while Black workers saw rates of 16.7 percent, and Latinx workers hit 18.9 percent. (Asian workers were about even with white workers, at 14.5 percent.) The jobs recovery has been much swifter for white workers than workers of color. Unemployment for whites dipped back below 10 percent in July; for Black workers, that didn’t happen until December. And in January, the unemployment rate for Black workers was at 9.2 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for whites — a larger spread than pre-pandemic.

Congressional inaction on unemployment benefits has the potential to do outsized harm to Black workers and other workers of color, and if policymakers don’t look at those groups’ jobs situation specifically, they don’t shape policy accordingly. “The gains that Black workers have made since the Great Recession were basically wiped out in the first couple of months of Covid,” Janelle Jones, who the Biden administration has tapped as chief economist at the Department of Labor, told Vox in an interview last year. She noted that if the national unemployment rate was what it was for Black workers, “we would not be taking our foot off the gas.”

There’s a Covid-induced “she-cession”

Most recessions tend to have an outsized impact on male workers — the Great Recession, for example, hit male-dominated industries such as manufacturing and construction. The Covid-19 economy, however, has been quite different: It’s been devastating for women.

Women make up the majority of the workforce in some sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality, and child care, and often, these workers are women of color. And even where those jobs have come back, women aren’t being brought back at the same rates as their male counterparts, said Jasmine Tucker, the director of research at the National Women’s Law Center. “Employers are making choices about who needs the money and who they’re going to keep,” she said. “I think there are still some misconceptions about women not being breadwinners ... but the opposite is true.”

Many women have dropped out of the workforce altogether. With schools closed because of the pandemic, the burden of child care disproportionately falls on women in many families. “We can’t talk about getting back to work without talking about investing in child care,” Tucker said.

Bernstein, the Biden economic adviser, addressed the unique nature of how the pandemic has affected women in his reaction to the jobs report on Friday: “This larger decrease for women is unusual in a recession and likely reflects both the industries this pandemic has hit — tourism, services, face-to-face industries, leisure and hospitality, restaurants — and increased care responsibilities that have been pulling women out of the labor force.”

Shierholz warned that women risk being hit by a second round of layoffs if federal aid for states and cities doesn’t come through — an issue that’s been a major sticking point for Republicans in stimulus negotiations. “In a second wave, public sector workers get hit, and that disproportionately hits women,” she said. “So then you’ll see women’s recovery happening much more slowly because there’s this countervailing force dragging them down.”

Last month, 275,000 women ages 20 and over left the workforce, compared with a decline of 71,000 men. There were about 2.4 million fewer women in that age group in the labor force in January 2021 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, there were 1.8 million fewer men, meaning that women have left the workforce at a higher rate than men.

The higher the educational attainment, the more stable the job situation

Higher-educated workers continue to fare better during the Covid-19 outbreak than those with lower levels of educational attainment. In January, the unemployment rate for those with less than a high school diploma was at 9.1 percent; for high school graduates, it was at 7.1 percent. For those with some college, the unemployment rate was 6.2 percent, and for those with at least a bachelor’s degree, it was 4 percent.

This is similar to what happened during the Great Recession, though as the Pew Research Center notes, one different factor now is how important the ability to work from home is for people to be able to stay on the job. According to its research, people with college degrees are six times as likely to be able to work from home as those without a high school degree — and in a scenario where so many in-person jobs have been shed, that makes a difference.

Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs website Indeed, said in an interview that some high-wage sectors such as finance and tech did some layoffs early in the pandemic, though they were likelier to pause hiring. Jobs listings in those areas have started to pick up a bit now, in large part because of the vaccine rollout, which is the key to getting the economy back to normal. “They’re focused on the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

Working from home has been bad for people whose jobs depend on others going into the office

In metropolitan areas where a higher percentage of workers can work from home, the number of job postings is down 13 percent from where they were pre-pandemic, according to data from Indeed. That’s compared to metro areas overall where postings have mostly recovered.

“The biggest surprise has been the effect in big, rich cities — tech hubs, financial centers,” Kolko said. Part of that decline in jobs has to do with a concentration of arts and entertainment in those areas. But more of the decline in places like New York, Boston, DC, and the Bay Area has to do with so many people working from home and, by extension, not spending as much time and money on services near where they normally went into the office. For example, if people aren’t going into work, they’re also not spending money on lunch out or haircuts after work near their offices.

“Ironically, even though it is very fortunate to have a job where you can work from home, some of the people and businesses who have suffered most are those who work in businesses that depend on customers who are now working from home,” Kolko said. “New York and the Bay Area are among the areas with the biggest job losses, even though they are richer places, and richer people have generally done better in this pandemic.”

Tourism and hospitality industries have tanked while jobs related to online delivery have grown

Job postings are down the most in industries directly affected by the coronavirus, like hospitality and tourism (down 38 percent since the pandemic began), which stay-at-home orders have in large part crushed, according to data from Indeed.

Jobs in tech and finance have largely recovered to where they were. Jobs related to online ordering like loading and stocking (30 percent) and driving (17 percent), are higher than they had been. Similarly, job postings for pharmacies, which are considered essential businesses and which people go to because of the coronavirus, are up.

The trend even holds within some sectors. Stepner, the Harvard economist, pointed out that consumer retail spending has now recovered, but how that’s translating into jobs is uneven — high-wage retail workers have gotten their jobs back; low-wage retail workers haven’t. “There’s actually been a reorientation of the retail sector toward large online retailers like Amazon and toward big-box stores, and those are the types of companies that are designed around ruthless efficiency,” he said.

Higher-paying jobs have had a better recovery

Employment rates for jobs where people make $27,000 a year or less are down 22.5 percent from where they were pre-pandemic, according to data from Opportunity Insights, the nonprofit research group at Harvard. Employment in middle-wage jobs, defined as making $27,000 to $60,000 a year, is down about 5 percent. Meanwhile, employment rates for people who make more than $60,000 a year are actually up about 3 percent. As such, job losses from the coronavirus pandemic serve to exacerbate existing job inequality. People in higher-income jobs not only make more, they’re more likely to be employed.

A bigger portion of the workforce was unionized in 2020 — because more non-unionized people lost their jobs

Another effect of coronavirus job losses? The share of people in unions went up for the first time in more than a decade.

Even though the total number of jobs represented by a union went down by 444,000 in 2020, union jobs made up a larger share of total jobs, 12.1 percent, up half a percentage point from 2019. That’s because, thanks to union protections, people with union jobs were more likely than non-union workers to keep their jobs. A similar thing happened in the last recession.

Correction, February 16: An earlier version of this article misstated who is more likely to keep their jobs among union workers and non-union workers.",voxdotcom,"['americas', 'explained', 'job', 'rate', 'black', 'white', 'women', 'work', 'unemployment', 'pandemic', 'unequal', 'charts', 'workers', 'jobs', 'deeply', 'economic', 'recovery']",0
2021-02-09 13:30:08+00:00,32,"February 6 marks the anniversary of the first American death from the coronavirus.

Since then, well over 400,000 Americans have died from complications related to Covid-19. It’s likely many more will die before we’re finally over the hump. It goes without saying that no matter who was in charge last year, this pandemic would have killed lots of people. But it’s also true that bad leadership costs many lives, and we’ll never know for sure how many could have been spared.

The story of America’s failure is long and complicated. When the full history is finally written, the depth of those failures will likely shock even those of us who have followed it closely in real time.

For now, the closest thing we have to a comprehensive account of America’s botched response to the coronavirus is Lawrence Wright’s sweeping story in the New Yorker. Published in December, just a few days before the year ended, the story documents what happened and when, and who was responsible — a staggering piece of reporting that goes as deep as anything written thus far.

Wright highlights three moments at which America could’ve have gotten things right but, for various reasons, didn’t. It’s as depressing as it is illuminating. I reached out to Wright, who also wrote The End of October, a 2020 novel about a pandemic originating in Asia (seriously), to talk about those three pivotal moments.

Beyond diagnosing what went wrong, I asked Wright what the federal government could have done differently and if he thinks a competent administration with a serious plan might’ve saved hundreds of thousands of lives. He explained what happened in exquisite detail, and I have to say, it’s maddening. This was indeed a tragedy and, as Wright suggests, one of the greatest failures in the history of American governance.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

You say there are three moments in which America’s Covid-19 response might have gone in a very different direction. Walk me through the first moment, in which China basically attempts to hide the scale of the pandemic in those early days.

Lawrence Wright

Right, the first moment occurs when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke to George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 3, 2020. This was already a fraught moment. Gao had really just started to discover the scale of the thing, and part of the dilemma was that in China people are afraid to report things up the chain. He was basically reading about what was happening on social media.

The tragic part about this moment is that Gao could not invite the American CDC team to come to China and help investigate the outbreak, and that set us back enormously. Redfield is sure that, had the CDC team been able to visit China at that point, we would’ve discovered that there was asymptomatic transmission, something we didn’t know at that point. This was already something that was being talked about in medical circles in China. It wouldn’t have been a secret. But the US, and really the rest of the world, did not figure this out until late February or early March. And had they known that, the strategy for dealing with this outbreak would have been entirely different.

“This was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad”

Sean Illing

Can the CDC be faulted for this, or is there little they could’ve done in the face of China’s intransigence?

Lawrence Wright

No, the CDC alone could not have done much. But the American government could have made it a much bigger issue, and we simply didn’t do it. People sat back and took the Chinese at their word. And look, China’s behavior at the beginning of this outbreak is nefarious. But the countries that knew China well — for instance, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan — they took precautions because they didn’t believe the Chinese assurances. And unfortunately, we didn’t do that. That was the first setback in our response and what I’d call strike one.

Sean Illing

Did you get any good answers as to why we sat back? It can’t be as simple as naiveté, can it? Or was the US government just scared to death of antagonizing China?

Lawrence Wright

All of those things were at play. There was absolutely a fear of antagonizing China. A great example of that is that we wanted to get our diplomats and businesspeople out of Wuhan, and China threw a fit. There was a “How dare you!” quality to their reaction. And in order to placate the Chinese, we sent these 747s over that we were going to use to pick up our citizens, and we stuffed it full of PPE gear, something like 18 tons of it. And we did it purely to mollify the Chinese.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the second moment.

Lawrence Wright

The second one was the fumble on the testing. The fault lies principally with CDC. But also, the FDA plays a role in this tragedy. The CDC was always the gold standard for public health agencies around the world. And one of the things they do is, they create tests for diseases. And they’ve been very good at that in the past. And of course, they were under terrific pressure in this moment and that in turn led to them taking some shortcuts.

So there are typically two main elements in a normal test kit, or two parts to the test. One is the primers and probes, as they call them, which detect the presence of viral antibodies. And the other is a piece of RNA that represents the virus. And these two things go together to make a test kit. Normally, you have them manufactured in separate facilities because it contaminates if you have them both in the same house. So the CDC took a shortcut. And they sent out the test kits knowing that it failed their own internal quality check. The fail rate was around 30 percent. But they sent out the kits anyway and they were totally unreliable.

Sean Illing

Wait, how the hell does that happen?

Lawrence Wright

The CDC didn’t know if it was a design problem or a manufacturing problem. They couldn’t figure it out. So the FDA sent this guy, Timothy Stenzel, down to Atlanta, the CDC headquarters. And it was immediately apparent what had happened. The lab was contaminated. They were processing samples of the test in the same room where they were making the test. So live virus samples were in the same room. And a mistake like that, you just can’t imagine the Centers for Disease Control doing that.

But there was another thing going on. There were three elements in the primers and probes, numbered one, two, and three. Numbers one and two detected against the SARS-CoV-2 and number three detected any coronavirus, in case it mutated. That was the element that failed. The test worked, except for that third element. All they had to do was to eliminate that third element and you would have a valid test. And the FDA refused to bend on this authorization, for weeks. We lost all of February because of the incompetence and inertia on the part of the CDC and FDA.

Sean Illing

You say we “lost all of February,” but what does that mean exactly? Can we even begin to speculate how many lives this dithering and incompetence cost?

Lawrence Wright

Well, there are models that show, at every step along the way, had the Chinese been more forthcoming earlier, had the Chinese shut down Wuhan earlier, had we gotten the test out sooner, it would have made an enormous difference in terms of the spread of the virus and the number of lives lost. We can’t say for sure, but had these things gone differently, we would be dealing with a fraction of what we’re facing now.

“More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured”

Sean Illing

Did anyone at the CDC or the FDA explain to you why in the world they sent out test kits knowing they were faulty?

Lawrence Wright

I asked Redfield about it and he said someone violated protocol. And that’s about it. They have an internal examination. No one’s really been held accountable. No one’s been fired. No one’s been fingered. But it’s pretty clear that it happened in the lab of Stephen Lindstrom, who was overseeing the test. And so far, there’s been no accountability for the failure in CDC.

I have to say that there’s been no real accountability at the FDA either. Because the FDA could have been responsive to the fact that the test obviously worked if you removed this third element. And they eventually did get it right, but they could have done it weeks earlier and, as I said, the consequences of this delay were enormous.

Sean Illing

There’s a crucial moment, on January 23, when a physician (Dr. Rick Bright) from HHS (Health and Human Services) tells various Trump officials, including Secretary Alex Azar, that the “virus might already be here,” and you write that the Trump people “seemed determined to ignore” the news. Does that mean they literally ignored it or does it mean they kept searching for “experts” to tell them what they wanted to hear?

Lawrence Wright

Both of those things were going on. They didn’t want to hear the news. They didn’t want to hear any bad news. But also there was this longing for someone to come along and say, “This is not a problem. It’s going away. And if you do nothing, we’ll be fine.” And Scott Atlas served that purpose.

Sean Illing

Wait, who is Scott Atlas?

Lawrence Wright

Scott Atlas is a neuroradiologist from Stanford who had been on Fox News a lot, saying that we needed to open up the schools, which is a legitimate debate. But he was advocating for “herd immunity,” which is this idea that when enough people have been either vaccinated or infected, the population at large is no longer susceptible to the spread of the disease. The main concept of herd immunity is, let people get sick. We don’t have the vaccine yet. If people get sick, then that will begin to choke off the spread.

The great appeal for the Trump administration was that you can achieve herd immunity by doing nothing. And that became the unspoken policy.

Sean Illing

Tell me about the third moment.

Lawrence Wright

This is, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all. Because in strike one and strike two, the rate of infection in the United States was still seemingly small. We didn’t have the tests, so we didn’t really know. But the sense of threat wasn’t as great. But when March rolls in and then you have New York City going into this horrible first wave, and the danger we’re facing is clear.

And all through February and March, Matt Pottinger, the deputy NSC (National Security Council) adviser, had been advocating for masks. And he was the only one in the White House who wore one. Finally in, I think it was April 3, the CDC swung around and recommended mask wearing in public after initially saying masks weren’t necessary.

If you look back at public health statements about masks, Dr. Fauci said that it wasn’t important for Americans to be wearing masks. And he said it at a time when the rate of infection seemed to be low. The surgeon general said, “Seriously, people. Stop buying masks. They won’t protect you.” And this is about the time they’re saying, “We need to have enough masks for hospitals.” So there was this disconnect. I mean, if they’re not effective, why did we need them in hospitals? It made no sense.

But finally, it becomes clear that masks are effective. Studies have shown it. The president is cajoled into making the statement. And he says, “It’s voluntary. I won’t be doing it. But some people say it works. But it’s up to you. It’s voluntary. I’m not going to do it.” And at that moment, we swung at strike three. Because Trump politicized the wearing of masks at a moment when he could have set an example. And that’s the last chance we had. Without masks, the country was engulfed in this contagion. And the responsibility for so many lives lies in the hands of the president of the United States in that moment.

Sean Illing

Give me the most charitable defense of the CDC on this one. What were they thinking when they said masks were unnecessary? Why not recommend masks, since there seem to be almost no downsides?

Lawrence Wright

It’s really weird, I have to say. Because on the one hand, you want people in hospitals to wear a mask when there’s a possibility of sharing germs. It’s always been true. We’ve known this for at least a century.

Sean Illing

Public health officials like Dr. Fauci have been lionized, partly because of the contrast with Trump, but they made big mistakes in the early days, especially on the mask front. Do you think history will judge them more harshly?

Lawrence Wright

They’re scientists. And at the beginning, they were relying on conventional scientific wisdom, which is, “This is a respiratory disease, it’s a coronavirus. SARS spread symptomatically, so it’s probably like SARS. And it’s probably like flu.” And they were wrong. What they didn’t know is it spread asymptomatically. And in that way, it’s more like polio. And so, their perception of it was wrong at the beginning. Eventually, they learned more about the disease and their message changed.

But unfortunately, it’s hard to change a message like that. Once you’ve made the statement that masks are not effective, you can’t just walk it back. Undoing that kind of communication is very difficult and we paid a big price for it.

Sean Illing

I’m making a deliberate effort to avoid overly simplistic narratives, so I want to ask this as clearly as possible: How much of America’s botched response falls on Donald Trump and the incompetent administration he assembled?

Lawrence Wright

America was going to face an enormous challenge under any circumstances. We have to understand that. A lot of people were going to get sick and a lot of people were going to die. But it’s also true that it didn’t have to be at the scale that we endured.

You can look at the various states and how they reacted to the virus and how the outcomes were different. And you can compare similar states; Kentucky and Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, Vermont and South Dakota. In many respects, these were similar states with similar demographics. In one case, the governor imposes strict lockdowns, mask wearing, and so on. In another case, the tap is open. One public health official said, “If the country had behaved like the state of Vermont, we would have 200,000 fewer deaths.” Well, that’s almost half of what we’re talking about. More responsible leadership could have made an immense difference in the suffering and the death that America has endured.

Sean Illing

One of the most infuriating parts of this whole account — and there are many — isn’t that Trump is incompetent or even malicious, it’s that he really doesn’t seem to give a shit. Every person you quote who was anywhere near him, and the various accounts of his interactions with governors and other officials, shows a man whose moral indifference strikes me as psychotic. As someone you quote in the piece said, “It’s all reality TV to him.”

Lawrence Wright

Well, I think that there’s an absence of compassion that marked the Trump administration. And what was very striking to me, the night before the inauguration of Joe Biden, he had a memorial to the 400,000 Americans who died. That one moment of reaching out and consoling the families of people who we’ve lost had been absent during that entire year. And when that happened, I just thought, “This is what we’ve been needing.” Just someone who recognized the toll that it’s taken on Americans. But up until that moment, it hadn’t happened.

Sean Illing

I don’t want to ask you to tell people how they should feel about this tragedy, so I’ll ask you how you feel about it: Is this the greatest and most consequential failure in the history of American governance?

Lawrence Wright

I wrote about 9/11 in The Looming Tower and I described the intelligence failure. Well, this was an intelligence failure. The American intelligence community had no idea about the catastrophic consequences that were about to enshroud our country. And it was a public health failure. Because we didn’t understand the nature of the virus, we fumbled in our efforts to create a test for it.

It’s so striking to me that this is one of those things where you’d think it would unify the country. We’re all in this together. And it’s not a partisan issue. We’re under siege. But instead, the culture became more divided. And it was a political failure. We had opportunities for leadership and we didn’t get it. It was an incredible failure all the way down.

Again, this was going to be bad no matter what happened, but it didn’t have to be this bad. If we had only done as good a job as Vietnam or South Korea, we could’ve saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of American lives. And we were supposed to be the country best equipped to deal with the pandemic. We had better resources than any country on earth. And that just makes the failure all the more catastrophic because we could have done a good job. And we did the worst job in the world.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'response', 'lawrence', 'covid19', 'cdc', 'botched', 'job', 'americas', 'masks', 'things', 'failure', 'going', 'say', 'world', 'didnt', 'worst', 'test', 'moment', 'wright']",0

2021-02-09 01:35:28+00:00,24,"Editor’s note, January 10, 2022: This article was originally published in February 2021, and public health guidance around masking to prevent Covid-19 transmission may have shifted. For Vox’s latest coverage on the pandemic, see here.

My favorite face mask is a sleek black cloth number — it goes with everything, it doesn’t chafe my face, and it’s sold in a relatively affordable three-pack, so I always have a backup. I have a whole collection of cloth masks, like you probably do, cobbled together at random, in bright colors and patterns, generally homemade by an assortment of people in my life.

Yet, as we’ve slipped into allowing our face coverings to project our tastes while they protect us, there’s another element of style that’s often forgotten: fit. And fit is incredibly important when it comes to how effective our masks are.

Tons of celebrities have been seen out with their masks underneath their noses. Notably, members of Congress who promote masking up have been seen pulling up their sliding masks in public.

Cloth masks sometimes lend themselves to poor etiquette: Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) slipped his down to sneeze into his hand on C-SPAN, which is, to put it plainly, horrifying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is known to have masks that match her outfits but was once photographed in a conversation with George Floyd’s brother, mask hanging down below her mouth. And soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden’s mask slipped down his face in the midst of signing an executive action related to Covid-19. It happens to the best of us. Walk around anywhere in pandemic America, and you’ll surely encounter people fiddling with their masks.

But in order to truly protect you, cloth masks need to have a snug fit. And wearing a well-fitted mask might be more important than it’s ever been in the pandemic. As previously reported by Julia Belluz for Vox, a more contagious new variant of Covid-19, known as B.1.1.7, that’s now spreading around the world, should make us even more cautious about our risk of exposure to the virus, especially in indoor spaces.

Mask fit really matters

Proper mask-wearing remains a key factor in preventing the transmission of the coronavirus. A mask slip can leave the wearer extremely vulnerable, as the nasal passage is a common entryway for the virus to get into the body. According to a study in Nature Medicine, the virus attaches to certain proteins found in the nasal passage. There are actually more of these proteins in the nose than in the lungs, making an exposed nose a serious threat. You don’t want any viral particles getting to your nose, so it’s imperative that your mask has a tight fit.

Cloth masks are still fine for the general public to use, experts tell me, so don’t feel like you have to run out and buy a medical-grade mask like an N95. We think about what our masks look like every day, but we are largely ignoring the importance of the proper fit. There’s not enough emphasis on what makes a mask well-fitted and effective — we’ve gotten distracted with design, when really we need to be worrying about how comfortable our masks are and whether or not they are secure enough to rely on.

The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force, a research group based out of Cambridge University, investigates the efficacy and improvement of civilian face masks and fabrics. “What we found through our research is that the actual filtration material is not as important as fit. In order to get any benefit from a high filtration material, you have to have fit,” Eugenia O’Kelly, a PhD student who heads the group, said. O’Kelly emphasized that without highly specialized machinery, there is no way to be 100 percent sure your mask fits, but did have tips for improved fit and protection.

According to her team’s tests, double masking can be helpful. “Keep in mind, you do not end up numerically doubling your protection by layering masks. I have seen a lot of this type of ‘math’ online, but unfortunately, this is not how depth filtration works,” she said. But doubling up can ensure you get a better seal around the nose and mouth than one mask alone that might be a bit too loose. According to the new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released February 10, well-fitted surgical masks or a “cloth and surgical mask combination” can reduced virus transmission by up to 96.5 percent. The director of the CDC has also urged Americans to wear a mask with “two or more layers,” the New York Times reports.

O’Kelly says there are two methods scientists use to find out if a mask fits. “You can have quantitative fitting and qualitative fitting. In quantitative fitting, you are measuring the amount of particles inside and outside of the mask,” she said. Most surgical masks don’t fit tightly enough, or are made of material without sufficient filtration, so they won’t pass.

Quantitative fitting can be expensive because it requires specialized hospital equipment. “More common is qualitative mask fitting,” she said, for which her team is experimenting with using aroma diffusers as a test. If you are wearing a mask and can taste the particles through it, it’s a sign that your mask is ill-fitting.

In order to identify if your mask is good at protecting others, O’Kelly recommends avoiding masks with the following characteristics:

Thin material: If you can see any gaps between the fibers when you hold it to the light, that is a sign that viruses can get through. Single-layer: If your mask only has one (or even two) layers of fabric, the filtration is probably not high. The best masks have multiple layers or have a pocket to insert a filter, such as a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter. Poor fit: Fit is very important in a mask’s success, as you can read about in this recent study. You may not be able to get a mask that fits you perfectly, but the more and larger the gaps you see, the poorer the fit is. This may be more important when protecting the wearer than others. Discomfort: If the mask is very uncomfortable, you may be less likely to wear it correctly, and more likely to touch the outside of the mask or adjust it while out and about.

So how should a mask fit? “The mask should be a good fit over the nose and mouth, but not overly tight to impair breathing. It is not intended to filter out all the air one breathes, but intended to hold back droplets from our mouth from spreading in the air,” George Abraham, the chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine’s Infectious Disease Board, tells me.

There’s not a lot we can do to prevent a mask from falling down — except maybe try to find a mask that fits better.

O’Kelly also recommends doing a fit check, although there is no reliable way to currently assess the fit of fabric masks. “Move your hand around the edges of the mask where it makes contact with your skin and see if you can feel any air. If you feel the air, there is a gap,” she said. But just because a mask has a gap does not mean it’s totally ineffective. It just means it’s not providing the maximum level of protection possible. According to O’Kelly, a fabric mask with fit issues can protect the user from over 50 percent of particles, and well-constructed fabric masks with gaps still can filter over 75 percent of particles.

In a Consumer Reports article, William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, recommends tightening your mask if it slips off your nose. You can adjust the strings and make sure there isn’t any space for air on the sides. Our best bet is selecting a mask that fits properly: snug around the nose and mouth without gaps at the sides. A wire nose bridge can help your mask mold to your face. The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force’s studies have found that a metal nose band can improve fit. However, in less structured or elastic masks, that nose band can also harm performance, so the user has to make a judgment call.

But shouldn’t we just get N95s?

As comforting as it might be that experts say cloth masks are sufficient, the United States is far behind countries like Austria, where the government provides FFP2 masks to citizens, and Taiwan, where the government has been providing citizens with high-quality masks that are probably going to fit better than some of the cloth masks in circulation. Why can’t the same happen here in the United States?

The argument for the government to supply masks is not new. It might do Americans well to have better PPE, but there are a lot of caveats that come with the use of heavy-duty masks like the N95. In an email, Abraham told me that it would be difficult for the government to make sure that everyone had an effective N95. “The wearer needs to be ‘fit-tested’ so that the mask being used is not leaking but forms a good seal on the face, or else the ability of the mask to filter is lost,” he wrote. “As a practical reality, that is not consistently possible with the general public.”

There are ways to test the N95 — “you could place both hands around the rim of the mask, once on the face, and blow hard into it. If you feel air on your hands, you know the mask is not a tight fit,” Abraham explains. But according to experts, it is also not 100 percent accurate.

The N95 masks are a must for health care workers because they’re great for long exposure situations, but they might be excessive for short-term use, according to Abraham. An N95 mask might be more appropriate for a long plane ride, for example, instead of a quick run to the grocery store. “The use of the mask would be inconsistent, without doing a fit check every time,” Abraham said, and it would be “cost-prohibitive and accomplish little.” The government couldn’t regulate the N95 use of every civilian, and the respirators would be rendered useless if not properly fitting.

Philonise Floyd’s heart-wrenching testimony to @HouseJudiciary left its mark on us all. May this flag, which flew over the Capitol on the day of his brother’s murder, serve as a symbol of our shared commitment to securing justice for George & all victims of police violence. pic.twitter.com/Dl3LXDGF7t — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) June 10, 2020

While the research O’Kelly’s group has done on mask materials is still being peer-reviewed, she says that even a mask with poor fit is better than not wearing one at all. “If you can see a gap at all, your mask is probably not functioning at 100 percent. However, that certainly does not mean the mask is useless if there are gaps.” Any kind of gap can compromise the effectiveness of a mask, so it is important to try to make sure there are no spaces if possible.

So next time you find yourself tugging at your face mask all day, consider finding another style or model that may work better. For extra protection, spend a little more money to get a mask with a pocket to add a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter, and shop around to get multiple masks that you can fit check at home. Mask slipping plagues us, but if we work at it, we can ward off the actual plague. It might take some trial and error, but this is worth getting right.",voxdotcom,"['nose', 'fits', 'important', 'masks', 'mask', 'fit', 'filter', 'better', 'face', 'air', 'cloth', 'vs', 'n95', 'answer']",0

2021-02-08 20:00:07+00:00,6,"President Joe Biden acknowledged his final coronavirus stimulus bill will probably look different from his $1.9 trillion opening bid, in his first network interview since being inaugurated.

The new president told CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell that the prospect of including a $15 minimum wage in his final Covid-19 relief bill is dimming, and he’s also considering lowering the income threshold of who will get additional $1,400 stimulus checks.

“I’m prepared to negotiate on that,” Biden told O’Donnell, saying he believed stimulus checks should go to middle-class families, capping it at individuals who make $75,000 annually and couples making $150,000 per year. But Biden also said he’s open to negotiating on a different number. “I’m wide open on what that is,” the president said.

What Biden seemed less willing to negotiate on was the $1,400 amount for stimulus checks. Biden promised to deliver $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans as part of his closing argument in the January Georgia Senate runoffs (under Biden’s plan, the $1,400 combines with the $600 stimulus checks sent out in December).

As they negotiate with congressional Republicans and some moderate Democrats on Capitol Hill, Biden’s administration wants to stay true to the sum on the check. But they see room to work with in who may get those checks.

Appearing on CNN on Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested a middle ground between Biden’s $75,000 cap and the $50,000 individual cap for stimulus checks being proposed by a group of 10 Congressional Republicans: capping stimulus checks at those making $60,000 per year.

“If you think about an elementary school teacher or a policeman making $60,000 a year and faced with children who are out of school and people who may have had to withdraw from the labor force in order to take care of them and many extra burdens, [Biden] thinks, and I would certainly agree, that it’s appropriate for people there to get support,” Yellen told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I think the details can be worked out.”

As for the $15 minimum wage, Biden admitted that it likely won’t make it into the final bill because of specific Senate rules. Democrats are moving ahead with a process to pass Biden’s stimulus package through the 51-vote budget reconciliation process — thereby avoiding the normal 60-vote legislative process that can be filibustered. Biden was referring to the Byrd rule, a mechanism that dictates that the things in a reconciliation bill must impact the federal deficit.

“I put it in, but I don’t think it’s going to survive,” Biden told O’Donnell of the $15 minimum wage. “Apparently that’s not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate. I do think we should have a minimum wage stand by itself.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday that the White House would wait and see whether the Senate parliamentarian decides on whether the $15 minimum wage can be included in reconciliation or not.

Raising the minimum wage to $15 has been embraced widely across the Democratic party, although it has one key detractor in moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has said he thinks raising the minimum wage too quickly would hurt small businesses in his largely rural state. Manchin is a key swing vote in the current 50-50 Senate; not having him on board with Biden’s plan could stall the effort to raise the minimum wage because Republicans don’t support it.

“I’m prepared as president of the United States to have a separate negotiation on minimum wage, to work [it] up from what it is now,” Biden said. “Look, no one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage, and if you’re making less than $15 an hour, you’re living below the poverty wage.”

The wide-ranging interview with O’Donnell hit on a number of other issues Biden is facing in his presidency, including reining in the Covid-19 crisis, when he thinks the US will reach herd immunity, and why he doesn’t think former President Donald Trump needs to continue to receive intelligence briefings. The first part of the interview aired before Sunday’s Super Bowl, while the rest is set to air on Monday night.

Biden said he hoped the US would reach herd immunity this year

Biden’s biggest immediate challenge in his presidency is defeating Covid-19 and rapidly increasing the pace of vaccinations across the country. And Biden said it will be difficult for the US to reach herd immunity before the end of this summer.

“The idea that this can be done and we can get to herd immunity much before the end of this summer is very difficult,” Biden told O’Donnell. Biden’s top Covid-19 advisers, including Anthony Fauci, have estimated it’s more likely that the nation reaches herd immunity by late summer or the fall.

Biden has set a goal for 1.5 million vaccinations to happen per day, and the current rate is around 1.3 million a day, according to O’Donnell. Even at the current pace, it would take until the summer before the US reached herd immunity, the CBS anchor noted. And that doesn’t take into account the potential for new variants to spread.

Ahead of the Super Bowl, Biden told O’Donnell he had talked with National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell about using NFL stadiums as vaccination sites, to dramatically ramp up the number of people getting the vaccine.

“We’re pushing as hard as we can to get more vaccine manufactured,” Biden told O’Donnell, adding that his White House has been hamstrung by the lack of vaccine secured by the Trump administration. Biden also emphasized that while he wants schools to reopen, they must be safe for teachers and kids to go back to the classroom — meaning better ventilation, masking, and fewer people in a classroom.

“It’s my hope and expectation we’re able to make up for all the lost time fighting Covid ... that we’ll be able to watch the [next] Super Bowl in a stadium,” Biden said. “God willing, we’re going to be able to celebrate it all as usual a year from now.”

Biden said he doesn’t think Trump needs to get intel briefings

The new president has been hesitant to weigh in on the impending impeachment trial of his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.

Trump’s second impeachment trial starts this week in the US Senate, after the House charged him with inciting the January 6 insurrection of the US Capitol after his months of falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulently stolen. Biden has been reticent to weigh in on the trial and whether the Senate should convict the 45th president, and was no different during the CBS interview.

“I ran like hell to defeat him because I thought he was unfit to be president,” Biden told O’Donnell. “I watched what everybody else watched, what happened when that crew invaded the US Congress. But I’m not in the Senate now; I’ll let the Senate make that decision.”

Still, Biden said he thinks Trump should be stripped of his ability to receive intelligence briefings. This privilege is afforded to past presidents, in the event they are able to weigh in and give the president advice on a matter of national security. Biden clearly does not want Trump’s advice on any account because of the former president’s “erratic behavior.”

“I think not,” Biden told O’Donnell. “I just think there’s no need for him to have the intelligence briefing. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something.”",voxdotcom,"['bill', 'biden', 'doesnt', 'president', 'odonnell', 'senate', 'think', 'stimulus', '15', 'minimum', 'told', 'wage']",0
2021-02-08 17:23:49+00:00,42,"Rep. Ron Wright (R-TX) has become the first sitting member of Congress to die from Covid-19.

His death, almost one year to the date after the US’s first confirmed death from the virus, comes amid a grim period in the country’s fight against Covid-19. Although case counts are falling from their early January peak, deaths are still rapidly accumulating. The US passed 450,000 confirmed Covid-19 deaths last week, mere weeks after the 400,000 death mark was reached on January 19.

Wright, 67, represented Texas’s Sixth Congressional District, which includes Arlington and southeastern Fort Worth, since 2019. His office announced he had tested positive on January 21, with a statement from Wright saying he was experiencing minor symptoms but felt “okay.” Wright had also battled lung cancer since 2018, according to multiple outlets, including the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

In a statement, Wright’s team said he and his wife Susan had been at Dallas’s Baylor Hospital for two weeks. He died on Sunday night.

“Congressman Wright will be remembered as a constitutional conservative,” a representative for Wright said in the statement. “He was a statesman, not an ideologue.”

In his two years in office, Wright sat on the foreign affairs and education and labor committees. He spent his final month in office voting against impeaching former President Donald Trump, introducing anti-abortion bills and voting against the certification of the 2020 election results.

Though Wright is the first sitting member of Congress to die of the disease, at least 50 others have tested positive or were presumed positive for it, according to NPR. And Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died five days before he was set to take his seat as a House Republican from Louisiana, at age 41.

National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer, a Minnesota representative, offered condolences to Wright’s family in a statement.

“Congressman Wright was a sixth generation Texan and a dedicated public servant who devoted his life to bettering his community,” Emmer said. “I hope the legacy and good work Ron leaves behind is a comfort to his family during this devastating time.”

A second-term House member, Wright won in 2018 after the retirement of longtime House member Joe Barton, who represented the district for over 30 years. Wright had previously served as Barton’s chief of staff and as the Tarrant County tax assessor-collector, according to the Texas Tribune.

2021-02-08 03:11:01+00:00,28,"It feels bizarre that there’s a Super Bowl at all this year. Last year, the event fell on February 2, narrowly beating the chaos of the coming weeks when the coronavirus began to take over the United States. So much has changed since the last Big Game, but this year the show must go on. The Weeknd will perform, as will former youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman, of Biden inauguration fame.

Those who aren’t all that into football might not care much when the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off this Sunday, though many find the ads to be a big draw, as silly as they often are. But while viewers might expect brands will be forced to address this difficult year — and according to a survey conducted by Lucid, 69 percent of respondents expect this year’s commercials to explore major topics, like the pandemic and social issues, with 76 percent expecting to see people social distancing or wearing masks — they might be surprised at the still-light tone. Aside from a few commercials here and there, the advertisements this year will remain silent on hot-button issues.

It’s all pretty run-of-the-mill content in which celebrities will try to sell us stuff. In a Bud Light commercial, beer is rescued from sudden peril by Post Malone and an array of other celebrities — typical plot!

For Logitech, Lil Nas X does a pseudo spoken-word poem, celebrating a variety of real-life creators — in particular, visual artists, light artists, a graphic designer and illustrator, makeup artist, musician, and a streamer — doing their thing, and although we don’t learn their names while we listen to Lil Nas X’s latest hit, we do know that Logitech products help them all “defy logic,” whatever that means.

Sex sells, and apparently that means Michael B. Jordan must play the part of an Alexa who is seducing someone else’s wife.

Will Ferrell and Kenan Thompson star in an ad for General Motors, highlighting their latest push on electric vehicles. In the commercial, Ferrell is enraged to find out that Norway sells more electric cars per capita than the United States, which doesn’t sound like a very surprising fact, but okay! The advertisement is still odd, considering GM’s history of opposing climate action.

Sometimes, it’s more like almost-stars — a Michelob seltzer commercial featuring Don Cheadle and his brother Colin plays with the idea of real versus fake, featuring a run of fake celebs: Megan Fox, Lucy Liu, and Maluma.

And distressingly, Dolly Parton, who has enjoyed a fantastic pandemic press run (she helped fund the Moderna vaccine) recreated her classic hit “9 to 5” for Squarespace, flipping it to be “5 to 9” to celebrate second jobs and side hustles. “5 to 9 / you keep working working working / working 5 to 9 / till your dreams come true,” she croons. It feels a little bleak. Sure, a passion project can be liberating, but the sickly sweet tune of “working working working” reminding us to monetize any hobbies we might have is depressing.

Ad Age reported that although there probably won’t be as many car commercials this year, the financial sector is heating up — think mortgages, credit card companies, insurance, and the like. It makes sense. Americans have suffered in the past year from financial instability. People have lost their jobs and homes and have gone into serious debt during the pandemic. But most of the references we see are obscure.

In a commercial for Scotts’ Miracle-Gro, Martha Stewart and John Travolta promote backyard fun, since people’s yard space has had “quite a year,” but nobody ever says the words “coronavirus” or “pandemic.”

Bass Pro Shops took it a step further by reminding viewers that nature can make us feel better. They don’t say the word “pandemic” either, and instead go for “trying times.” According to Bass, we’re all “one family in the great outdoors.”

WeatherTech will run two ads celebrating American manufacturing. Both commercials include happy testimonials from its factory workers but fail to mention that the brand produces face shields and other Covid-19-related products.

Fiverr, the freelance service brand, will unveil its first-ever Super Bowl ad, angled to highlight how it served businesses during the pandemic and featuring a cameo from Four Seasons Total Landscaping, of Trump-era fame. Similar to the Dolly Parton ad, though, it’s just another promotion of side-hustle culture.

Indeed, the popular job search engine, will show the journey of job seekers across the country, reminding viewers that unemployment during the pandemic has skyrocketed, but fear not: with Indeed, maybe we can finally regain employment.

Coors, while not airing a commercial during the televised Super Bowl, will attempt a particularly dystopian feat this year by aiming to infiltrate your mind while you sleep with the Coors Dream Project. Frankly, this feels more like an invasion of privacy than a cutesy ad campaign tactic, but what do I know?

Anheuser-Busch, the official beer sponsor of the NFL, will be airing a Super Bowl ad this year that’s actually pretty heartwarming. The commercial details all the little interactions we had with people pre-pandemic: strangers mingle at an airport bar, newlyweds laugh at their rained-out wedding, coworkers enjoy in-person office camaraderie, pals catch up at a bowling alley. At a funeral, a woman catches the tired eyes of her mourning friend. The woman smiles while gesturing over her shoulder — the universal symbol for “hey, want to grab a beer after this?” The grateful nod yes is incredibly moving.

The commercial works because it acknowledges the unsaid. It reminds us of what we’ve lost in this pandemic, but also that there will be times when we can return to those beautiful little moments. Not to wax poetic on behalf of a beer brand, but the ad is a small piece of art. It’s a picture of the past and a fantasy all at once. In the ad, there is no pandemic, or in the future there is none.

Some brands — known in the past for their splashy ads — are making donations in lieu of spending millions on Super Bowl time slots. Planters, which last year killed Mr. Peanut and gave birth to Baby Nut, is donating $5 million to a variety of causes. Coca-Cola is sitting out to save money, and Pepsi is focusing their efforts on backing their halftime performer, The Weeknd.

Budweiser, of the perennial Clydesdales, is putting money toward vaccine education, and Kia said they will donate to “charitable initiatives in support of America’s youth,” although they weren’t too specific. Corporate donations can be a big deal when they make a statement. In January after the insurrection, many companies pulled PAC donations from lawmakers who were against election certification. When it comes to Super Bowl ads, it’s definitely a nice gesture, but it isn’t much of a real stance.

You might think that companies would have more to say this year, considering there’s a pandemic going on in which millions of people have died, Trump just left the White House, and there was an insurrection at the Capitol only a few weeks prior to the Super Bowl, but they aren’t sharing their thoughts on all that. Corporate America wants to distract us from the elephant in the room, with beer and gentle reminders that maybe we should update our life insurance. It doesn’t want to talk about the glaring why of it all, which is that we are very vulnerable right now, left out in the cold by a lethal combination of capitalism and misinformation. So, maybe we want to watch football in peace.

2021-02-07 19:33:00+00:00,41,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0

2021-02-07 11:01:01+00:00,6,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-07 00:39:38+00:00,17,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been bad for the United States economy, but not as bad as some experts and economists feared early on in the outbreak. The recovery, though, is uneven — and it’s slowing.

In January, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent, and the country added just 49,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate is lower than it was pre-pandemic, as many Americans left the workforce. America is also still millions of jobs short of where it was pre-pandemic.

“This morning’s employment report revealed a stall in the American job creation machine and underscores how precarious of a situation our economy is in,” Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein said in a White House briefing on Friday. “Lack of job growth is a result of our failure to act appropriately in response to this immense dual crisis, and our economy and our families can’t afford for us to fail to act once again.”

How the country is experiencing the economy varies widely, and how workers are experiencing the pandemic differs, too. Life is much better for the wealthier segment of workers than it is for those at the bottom, and the top-line figures camouflage the realities of what people are dealing with in their day-to-day lives.

But digging in deeper on the numbers is worthwhile. Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard has estimated that for workers in the top wage quartile, unemployment has fallen below 5 percent; meanwhile, for those in the bottom wage quartile, that number is likely more than 20 percent. Many of these workers have access to expanded unemployment insurance, but the system is difficult to navigate. It’s not clear when benefits will end as Congress continues to haggle over more stimulus.

Higher-income (and often white) workers are more often able to work from home. Not only are they less likely to lose money from pandemic job losses, they’re saving money because there are fewer opportunities to spend. Meanwhile, lower-income (and often Black and brown) workers have either been deemed “essential,” meaning they’re putting their health at risk to get paid, or they’re out of work. A restaurant job is hard to come by when so many restaurants aren’t open.

What we’re seeing is a K-shaped economic recovery, one where certain segments of the population are doing much better than everyone else. For those at the top of the K, life — at least as far as having a job — is decent. Those at the bottom, not so much. The Covid-19 pandemic has made the realities of the disparities among workers in America more evident than ever.

“All recessions hit low- and middle-income people harder, they disproportionately hit people of color,” said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the Department of Labor. “Recessions always exacerbate existing inequalities, but this one is just doing that more than we’ve ever seen before.”

Understanding what’s happening to workers during the pandemic entails understanding how uneven the situation is. Black and Latinx workers face a different horizon than white workers, women are experiencing a different scenario than men, and in some cases, the people who can work from home are directly affecting the workers who can’t. If a Manhattan coffee cart guy depends on office workers for business, what happens when those people are now working from their Brooklyn couches?

“The basic story of the K-shaped recovery has just been staring us in the face for a long time,” said Michael Stepner, an economist and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard research project Opportunity Insights. “It’s unrealistic to think that these jobs are going to be restored while the pandemic is raging.”

Vox took a look at seven sets of data that help tell the story of how unevenly American workers are experiencing the current economy. The following charts tell a stark story about inequality in the country — inequality that has been made worse by the pandemic in some of the most vulnerable populations.

The pandemic has slammed Black workers

The unemployment rate for Black workers consistently lags behind white workers, and during the pandemic, that reality has been exacerbated. When the overall unemployment rate spiked to 14.8 percent in April, it was at 14.1 percent for white workers, while Black workers saw rates of 16.7 percent, and Latinx workers hit 18.9 percent. (Asian workers were about even with white workers, at 14.5 percent.) The jobs recovery has been much swifter for white workers than workers of color. Unemployment for whites dipped back below 10 percent in July; for Black workers, that didn’t happen until December. And in January, the unemployment rate for Black workers was at 9.2 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for whites — a larger spread than pre-pandemic.

Congressional inaction on unemployment benefits has the potential to do outsized harm to Black workers and other workers of color, and if policymakers don’t look at those groups’ jobs situation specifically, they don’t shape policy accordingly. “The gains that Black workers have made since the Great Recession were basically wiped out in the first couple of months of Covid,” Janelle Jones, who the Biden administration has tapped as chief economist at the Department of Labor, told Vox in an interview last year. She noted that if the national unemployment rate was what it was for Black workers, “we would not be taking our foot off the gas.”

There’s a Covid-induced “she-cession”

Most recessions tend to have an outsized impact on male workers — the Great Recession, for example, hit male-dominated industries such as manufacturing and construction. The Covid-19 economy, however, has been quite different: It’s been devastating for women.

Women make up the majority of the workforce in some sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality, and child care, and often, these workers are women of color. And even where those jobs have come back, women aren’t being brought back at the same rates as their male counterparts, said Jasmine Tucker, the director of research at the National Women’s Law Center. “Employers are making choices about who needs the money and who they’re going to keep,” she said. “I think there are still some misconceptions about women not being breadwinners ... but the opposite is true.”

Many women have dropped out of the workforce altogether. With schools closed because of the pandemic, the burden of child care disproportionately falls on women in many families. “We can’t talk about getting back to work without talking about investing in child care,” Tucker said.

Bernstein, the Biden economic adviser, addressed the unique nature of how the pandemic has affected women in his reaction to the jobs report on Friday: “This larger decrease for women is unusual in a recession and likely reflects both the industries this pandemic has hit — tourism, services, face-to-face industries, leisure and hospitality, restaurants — and increased care responsibilities that have been pulling women out of the labor force.”

Shierholz warned that women risk being hit by a second round of layoffs if federal aid for states and cities doesn’t come through — an issue that’s been a major sticking point for Republicans in stimulus negotiations. “In a second wave, public sector workers get hit, and that disproportionately hits women,” she said. “So then you’ll see women’s recovery happening much more slowly because there’s this countervailing force dragging them down.”

Last month, 275,000 women ages 20 and over left the workforce, compared with a decline of 71,000 men. There were about 2.4 million fewer women in that age group in the labor force in January 2021 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, there were 1.8 million fewer men, meaning that women have left the workforce at a higher rate than men.

The higher the educational attainment, the more stable the job situation

Higher-educated workers continue to fare better during the Covid-19 outbreak than those with lower levels of educational attainment. In January, the unemployment rate for those with less than a high school diploma was at 9.1 percent; for high school graduates, it was at 7.1 percent. For those with some college, the unemployment rate was 6.2 percent, and for those with at least a bachelor’s degree, it was 4 percent.

This is similar to what happened during the Great Recession, though as the Pew Research Center notes, one different factor now is how important the ability to work from home is for people to be able to stay on the job. According to its research, people with college degrees are six times as likely to be able to work from home as those without a high school degree — and in a scenario where so many in-person jobs have been shed, that makes a difference.

Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs website Indeed, said in an interview that some high-wage sectors such as finance and tech did some layoffs early in the pandemic, though they were likelier to pause hiring. Jobs listings in those areas have started to pick up a bit now, in large part because of the vaccine rollout, which is the key to getting the economy back to normal. “They’re focused on the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

Working from home has been bad for people whose jobs depend on others going into the office

In metropolitan areas where a higher percentage of workers can work from home, the number of job postings is down 13 percent from where they were pre-pandemic, according to data from Indeed. That’s compared to metro areas overall where postings have mostly recovered.

“The biggest surprise has been the effect in big, rich cities — tech hubs, financial centers,” Kolko said. Part of that decline in jobs has to do with a concentration of arts and entertainment in those areas. But more of the decline in places like New York, Boston, DC, and the Bay Area has to do with so many people working from home and, by extension, not spending as much time and money on services near where they normally went into the office. For example, if people aren’t going into work, they’re also not spending money on lunch out or haircuts after work near their offices.

“Ironically, even though it is very fortunate to have a job where you can work from home, some of the people and businesses who have suffered most are those who work in businesses that depend on customers who are now working from home,” Kolko said. “New York and the Bay Area are among the areas with the biggest job losses, even though they are richer places, and richer people have generally done better in this pandemic.”

Tourism and hospitality industries have tanked while jobs related to online delivery have grown

Job postings are down the most in industries directly affected by the coronavirus, like hospitality and tourism (down 38 percent since the pandemic began), which stay-at-home orders have in large part crushed, according to data from Indeed.

Jobs in tech and finance have largely recovered to where they were. Jobs related to online ordering like loading and stocking (30 percent) and driving (17 percent), are higher than they had been. Similarly, job postings for pharmacies, which are considered essential businesses and which people go to because of the coronavirus, are up.

The trend even holds within some sectors. Stepner, the Harvard economist, pointed out that consumer retail spending has now recovered, but how that’s translating into jobs is uneven — high-wage retail workers have gotten their jobs back; low-wage retail workers haven’t. “There’s actually been a reorientation of the retail sector toward large online retailers like Amazon and toward big-box stores, and those are the types of companies that are designed around ruthless efficiency,” he said.

Higher-paying jobs have had a better recovery

Employment rates for jobs where people make $27,000 a year or less are down 22.5 percent from where they were pre-pandemic, according to data from Opportunity Insights, the nonprofit research group at Harvard. Employment in middle-wage jobs, defined as making $27,000 to $60,000 a year, is down about 5 percent. Meanwhile, employment rates for people who make more than $60,000 a year are actually up about 3 percent. As such, job losses from the coronavirus pandemic serve to exacerbate existing job inequality. People in higher-income jobs not only make more, they’re more likely to be employed.

A bigger portion of the workforce was unionized in 2020 — because more non-unionized people lost their jobs

Another effect of coronavirus job losses? The share of people in unions went up for the first time in more than a decade.

Even though the total number of jobs represented by a union went down by 444,000 in 2020, union jobs made up a larger share of total jobs, 12.1 percent, up half a percentage point from 2019.

Share All sharing options for: Covid-19 vaccines are great — here’s why you also still need to wear a mask for now

After months of exhausting isolation, widespread economic pain, and an extraordinary toll on human life and health, several Covid-19 vaccines are here.

Surely, this means we can stop wearing a face mask?

Eventually.

As with so much else in this pandemic, there isn’t an easy answer for exactly when we can start to relax. But, clearly, the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, like the ones developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, is our best path out of the crisis.

“We have every reason to believe that these are among some of the very best vaccines that we have ever tested,” said Aaron Richterman, a fellow researching infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania.

Though clinical trials give us confidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines block close to 95 percent of cases of the disease — thereby preventing the most severe outcomes of Covid-19 — there are still some uncertainties. Key among them is how well vaccines work to block transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Vaccines serve not only to protect individuals but also, after a certain threshold of vaccination, the population as a whole. That threshold is herd immunity — where even people who haven’t been vaccinated or infected before are protected because so many of the people around them are immune.

Transmission also has important practical consequences for the risks that arise as vaccinated individuals interact with everyone else, whether that’s in public parks, schools, households, or health care facilities. Early evidence points toward vaccines reducing transmission of Covid-19, but by exactly how much remains unclear.

A recent pre-print paper (not yet peer-reviewed) found that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine reduces viral loads, a key marker that shapes how readily the virus can spread, four-fold between 12 and 28 days after the first dose. It’s a promising result, but it’s based on less than 1,200 patients and needs more validation.

And that’s stirred up a fierce debate lately around how cautious we should be when talking about the power of the vaccines.

The question, given what scientists know and don’t know, is what message should people get about Covid-19 vaccines and how should they behave when they get them?

It’s a difficult needle to thread, to convey both optimism and caution, and there’s disagreement among scientists and experts over what should be the selling point of vaccines in the current moment. If you’re thinking about how your life might change after you get your shots, here’s what to consider.

What we know about Covid-19 vaccines and transmission

The main problem is that while the Covid-19 vaccines now available are amazingly effective at protecting recipients, it’s not clear how much they can prevent them from spreading the virus to other people. And because of that uncertainty, along with the current levels of spread of the disease, public health guidance still calls for the immunized to maintain social distance and wear face masks.

In the meantime, research is underway to figure out how much vaccinated people can transmit the virus. During phase 3 clinical trials, the main thing researchers are looking for is how well vaccines prevent disease — that is, people getting infected and showing detectable symptoms like fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and a loss of taste or smell.

However, asymptomatic transmission has emerged as a major driver of Covid-19. Getting a handle on how much asymptomatic transmission can occur even with a vaccine requires mass testing to detect the virus, since there are no other outward signs of infection. For clinical trials with thousands of participants, testing is a tedious, time-consuming endeavor, and there aren’t many robust findings yet.

That said, there is emerging evidence that Covid-19 vaccines do slow transmission.

Moderna, for example, screened its trial participants for SARS-CoV-2 between the first and second doses of its vaccine, finding that two-thirds fewer people in the vaccine group tested positive for the virus compared to the placebo, according to the company’s briefing to the Food and Drug Administration in December. It suggests that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose.

During the clinical trials for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which has not been approved in the US, researchers tested participants more frequently. An early analysis showed that the vaccine may be 59 percent effective at stopping asymptomatic infection.

There are other signs indicating the vaccines can reduce spread. Changes in immune system markers, like antibodies, in people who are vaccinated comport with what scientists expect in a situation that prevents the virus from setting up shop in people’s airways.

Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the focus on transmission in the context of Covid-19 vaccines can be misleading when comparing them to other vaccines. Part of what’s skewing the picture is that we have more information about Covid-19 transmission dynamics than other respiratory infections. “We never do mass testing for any respiratory virus unless you don’t feel well,” Gandhi said.

There are lessons we can draw from other vaccines, too. Researchers say it’s highly unlikely that a vaccine with a high efficacy against disease wouldn’t also make a significant dent in transmission. In fact, there are vaccines that are given mainly to prevent transmission more so than the disease, like the rubella vaccine, according to Paul Sax, clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School.

For the most part, the evidence is pointing toward Covid-19 vaccines reducing transmission of the virus

With Covid-19 vaccines, the fact that they prevent the most severe outcomes — even if they don’t prevent every instance of disease — can reduce transmission by itself. People with milder symptoms are less likely to cough and spread the virus through the air to others. “Even if it shifts it from symptomatic Covid to asymptomatic Covid, that still is a win for transmission, because asymptomatic people are less likely to transmit it because they don’t have as much virus for as long,” Sax said.

On the other hand, there are other vaccines that can prevent disease but have a much weaker effect on transmission, like the pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccine.

For the most part, the evidence is pointing toward Covid-19 vaccines reducing transmission of the virus. The critical question is by just how much, since that will shape the point where herd immunity occurs. “The exact amount that it reduces asymptomatic transmission is going to have consequences,” Richterman said. The answer will likely emerge in the coming months as researchers gather more data from clinical trials as well as among vaccine recipients in the general population.

What message do we send in the moment?

So scientists generally agree: The vaccines are essential for ending the pandemic, though they will take weeks or months to blunt the spread of Covid-19 across the population. Until that time, it’s necessary to keep up mask-wearing and social distancing in public.

But it’s not as though one day the country will cross a line going from unsafe to safe; rather, there will be a decline in risk over time. “I think the better way to frame it is, the vaccine is going to make every single activity the person does safer,” Richterman said. And while scientists can measure risk and come up with tactics to reduce it, they can’t determine how much risk is tolerable. That’s a value judgment people have to make as individuals.

Vaccines are certainly a major risk-reducer, arguably the largest when it comes to Covid-19. The risk of infection and transmission doesn’t drop to zero with a pair of shots, but when combined with other measures, like wearing face masks, they become a firewall against transmission. Right now, though, in the context of uncontrolled spread of Covid-19, even a reduced risk of transmission could still lead to problematic levels of new infection.

And there’s still a long way to go. Even though upward of one-third of the US population may have already been exposed to the virus, we don’t fully know who has had it because there are so many asymptomatic cases, and because of gaps in testing. It’s also not clear how long immunity lasts after infection and how well it will hold up against new SARS-CoV-2 variants, although early evidence shows immunity does last at least a few months and that prior infections offer some degree of shielding against newer versions of the virus. So the transmission aspect of the pandemic is going to remain a major issue for some time.

“My biggest concern right now in the short term is getting people to make sure they’re not easing up on the precautions they need to take, given the current situation and the lack of vaccine availability,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University.

One of the most delicate times in the pandemic will be the period between its worst throes and widespread immunity. That’s when there will be large groups of people who are vaccinated, as well as those who are not vaccinated, interacting in the same public spaces but with very different risk exposures.

Though some groups have broached the idea of using vaccine passports to identify the immune, there is no easy way to tell whether someone is protected just by looking at them, so across-the-board pandemic restrictions will likely have to remain in place. That may prove frustrating for people who survived the pandemic and went through the trouble of getting immunized but still can’t relax.

The message to those vaccinated people in this twilight period of the pandemic must be that they are duty-bound to keep up precautions like wearing masks in order to protect others, as an act of social solidarity.

But what’s the best way to frame this? Are we in the home stretch of the pandemic, or are we still mired in the worst phase? Should health officials emphasize how vaccines will return everyone to normal or highlight the unknowns and counsel caution? Should the vaccinated be scolded if they start to hang out with friends and travel?

Rasmussen noted that with the uncertainties around the Covid-19 vaccines, as impressive as they are, there is a fear of overpromising and underdelivering. The final results could reveal that vaccines may not block transmission as much as hoped, so if they’re overhyped, trust in public health officials could erode and lead to more vaccine hesitancy.

On the other hand, as groups of people get vaccinated, they might be able to relax around each other as their collective risk declines. Members of a household, neighbors, or people living in long-term care facilities may be able to share the company of others who are also immune.

But even vaccines, masks, and social distancing together won’t stop spread due to reckless behavior, just as airbags, seatbelts, and crumple zones don’t mean that it’s safe to drive inebriated over the speed limit. Vaccines are not a license to resume crowded indoor gatherings, since the overall vaccination rate is still low and the spread of the virus is still high.

“You can potentially get together with your parents that you haven’t seen in a long time if all of you have been vaccinated,” Rasmussen said. “What you should not do is get together with a bunch of your vaccinated friends and go hit the bars.”

Gandhi agreed that precautions will be necessary in many circumstances for people who receive vaccines.

“My risk tolerance is I will wear a mask around those who are unvaccinated,” Gandhi said. “I think many doctors will take off their mask around vaccinated people. And only vaccinated people.”

However, she argued that the messaging emphasis should be on how vaccines will speed up the return to a world outside the pandemic. Belaboring the blank spaces in our understanding of them when there is so much good news could also create hesitancy and undermine progress. Without a sense of progress and an achievable goal, it may get harder to keep up precautions until there is widespread immunity.

“It’s very helpful to tell the public that someday the masks will come off,” Gandhi said. “You can say it will be longer [to get to the end of the pandemic], and it will be, but please keep giving people hope.”

How can we tell we’ve crossed the finish line?

The main benchmark for ending the pandemic — and the goalposts of a vaccination campaign — should be to reduce fatality rates. “We should go all-in for mortality. The first thing we should see is a substantial, substantial reduction in mortality in the population,” said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “Even if we don’t find out that there is reduction in transmission, if enough people are protected and mortality goes down drastically ... even if it’s just individual effects, that’s a good way of returning to normal.”

Such a scenario would downgrade Covid-19 from a lethal public health threat to a moderate concern, and perhaps even a nuisance. Until there is a dramatic decline in fatality rates, however, face masks and social distancing will still be a part of everyone’s life, including those who are vaccinated.

After that, measures of transmission, such as the fraction of Covid-19 tests that yield positive results, could be used as an indicator of how much spread is still occurring.

The US may have to contend with sporadic outbreaks and even vaccine boosters, as immunity declines and new variants of the virus emerge. But widespread immunization creates a scenario where many of the most onerous burdens of the pandemic can be lifted.

Given the pace of progress in vaccinations, that could happen later this year.

“If there are no crazy variants, we can be in a situation where, in fall, things are more normal,” Omer said. “Maybe not fully normal, but better.”",voxdotcom,"['vaccinated', 'transmission', 'unclear', 'risk', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'disease', 'vaccines', 'infection', 'spread', 'viral', 'pandemic', 'effects']",0
2021-02-06 14:00:13+00:00,12,"As the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV, granting Tampa quarterback Tom Brady his seventh championship, all the players on the gridiron were being tracked closely as part of the NFL’s meticulous effort to contain Covid-19.

Beneath the shoulder pads of every player on the field in were small, white, rectangular gadgets. These devices are proximity sensors, measuring how close players come into contact with others and for how long.

Developed by Kinexon, the units on the field were just several of the more than 11,000 such devices attached to belts and wristbands, or dangling from lanyards of players and staffers at the National Football League over the past season. They’ve been providing league officials with terabytes of data, and are part of why the Super Bowl could be held at all.

Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, every professional sports league has had to come up with a way to cope with the widespread transmission of this deadly disease. They’ve used different approaches — like the NBA, which resumed its 2020 season in a bubble, with the final stretch of games and playoffs held at Disney World in Florida.

Surprisingly, many of the leagues found that the risk of transmission from player to player on the field, court, or ice is fairly low, which is why few players wear masks during games.

The NFL’s approach, nonetheless, is one for the highlight reel.

Near the end of the regular season, the league managed to contain the virus to fewer than 10 positive cases per week out of thousands of personnel. They accomplished this through a combination of mass testing, rigorous contact tracing, isolation of suspected cases, high-levels of mask-wearing, and social distancing.

“They had a comprehensive approach,” said Davidson Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health who was not involved with the league. “It seems like they did all of these things successfully.”

So successfully that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a case study last week looking at how the NFL managed to pull this off, examining the season between August and November 2020. During this period, the NFL found 329 confirmed cases of Covid-19, a positivity rate under 0.1 percent. The Covid-19 test positivity rate for the US as a whole is still around 7 percent.

The proximity trackers were certainly useful to league officials, and the NFL also brought its immense financial resources to bear on the problem. The results weren’t perfect; Brady was seen walking maskless into Raymond James Stadium before the game. And while the NFL did it’s best to control Covid-19 on the field, the organization faced criticism for how it handled the people around it.

This year’s Super Bowl saw its smallest in-person audience on record, but there were still 25,000 fans in attendance, with varying degrees of compliance with mask rules. Meanwhile thousands of revelers partied before, during, and after the game around Tampa, ignoring guidance to wear masks and maintain distance.

However, one of the most critical things the NFL was able to do was secure buy-in from their players, staffers, trainers, cooks, and coaches, all with the aim of hitting the gridiron every Sunday.

That commitment to a central goal may prove to be the biggest challenge for anyone else trying to copy the NFL’s playbook.

The NFL’s Covid-19 strategy, explained

At the start of the season, the NFL was still scrambling to figure out what actually worked to contain Covid-19. Rules were somewhat arbitrary and not always followed, and teams like the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans suffered large Covid-19 outbreaks. As the season progressed, teams started taking the pandemic more seriously, and the NFL shifted to a more aggressive set of rules to control the disease as officials gathered more information about just how the virus was being spread.

Here are some of the pivotal moves in the NFL’s playbook across its 32 teams.

Testing: The NFL conducted more than 1 million tests for Covid-19, testing players daily and using a combination of rapid point-of-care tests as well as laboratory tests that delivered results in 24 hours.

This disease surveillance allowed the league to find infections early and begin isolation protocols before the infected individual could spread the virus to more people.

Tracing: The data from the Kinexon devices helped league officials trace the footsteps of infected people and find out who else had a high likelihood of being infected based on how close their contacts were and for how long. Researchers found that there were several cases of transmission between people with less than 15 minutes of exposure.

Conversely, the league found no cases of transmission on the field during games, even though players weren’t wearing face masks. That’s likely due to their movement and ventilation available on the field. “We didn’t see the virus cross the line of scrimmage,” said Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, during the press conference on Thursday.

The league saw that after they implemented their intensive protocol, they found no high-risk contacts for 71 percent of cases that were traced, showing that the procedures made it far less likely infections would spread.

Such granular data collection was invasive, and analyzing it was labor-intensive, but it allowed the NFL to better target its approach.

Isolation: Infected individuals were told to isolate for five days and were tested during and after their isolation periods.

Mask-wearing: The NFL found very quickly that wearing masks was an important way to limit the spread of the virus. “In 100% of cases, poor mask compliance was part of the transmission,” said Christina Mack, the lead author of the CDC report and vice president for epidemiology and clinical evidence at IQVIA, a health data analysis firm, during the press conference.

However, getting just about everyone to wear masks at all times was a tall order, but players adjusted within weeks to wearing them at almost all times, even in the gym and during workouts. Players also had a little bit of peer pressure. “I think nobody wanted to be ‘that guy,’” said Anthony Casolaro, the team physician for the Washington Football Team, during the press conference.

Coupled with the data collection, the NFL was able to deduce when masks were most effective. While there was no on-field transmission, exposure risks grew the longer people were in contact. That’s why the NFL’s guidance allows players to be maskless during the game but makes them mask up as they shake hands afterward.

Reducing exposure: The league also took steps to limit opportunities for the virus to spread. Meetings were virtual. Players and staff were told not to carpool and were spread out across buses. Meals were provided in grab-and-go bags and no longer eaten together. Indoor spaces had sharp capacity limits.

Accountability: There was not only a comprehensive, centralized plan, but people were named responsible to execute it. “It was very clear how to get things done, when to get things done, and who was going to do them,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, during the press conference. “I’ve never seen anything that organized, that quickly able to take action.”

The NFL also took steps to punish individuals and organizations that failed to uphold the rules. Both the Ravens and the Titans received fines for breaching the league’s Covid-19 regulations.

The lessons we can and can’t take away from the NFL

Sills said that while the NFL invested a lot in daily testing and extensive tracing, such elements weren’t enough on their own to control Covid-19. “Those were not the things that prevented transmission because we had all those things in place and had transmission in some cases,” he said.

The things that did win the day for the league were tactics that anyone can use, like wearing masks and avoiding prolonged close contact. “These are lessons and strategies that can be applied in organizations, no matter what their resources are,” Sills said.

Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health who was not involved with the NFL, said the league’s experience does demonstrate that there are alternatives to endless isolation and boredom during the pandemic. “I think it shows us that really thoughtful approaches to Covid-19 can really allow us to do some things,” she said.

But even basic public health measures require personnel, time, effort, and money. These are resources that many parts of the country don’t have. People also have to be willing to follow the rules when no one is looking. “We can’t all have our own Covid babysitters,” Sell said. Without the shared mission and resources of an organization like the NFL, it’s much harder to build up a system to contain Covid-19.

NFL officials did not lay out how much money and personnel it took to contain outbreaks among its players and staff.

At the same time, there are hints at what might have happened if the NFL had not been so rigorous. The past college football season, which saw more than 100 canceled games and more than 6,000 infected players, might be an example. There are far more college football teams than NFL teams, and the pandemic was far more disruptive to college athletes, despite many schools’ best efforts to contain the spread. “They didn’t really have a unified approach,” Sell said.

Meanwhile, the US as a whole has been struggling with all of the most basic measures to control Covid-19, with spotty and delayed testing, resistance to mask-wearing, and often inadequate social distancing — not to mention the lack of granular data that could come from gadgets like proximity sensors or even tracking smartphones. There is also conflicting guidance about opening and closing schools and businesses, public officials are often at odds, and it’s hard to tell who is in charge.

So cities, states, companies, and schools are likely going to continue stumbling under the burden of new cases of the disease.

But as millions of Americans tuned in to watch the big game on Sunday, they saw a glimpse of what’s possible if they were to team up, follow the same plays, and launch a drive toward the end zone of the pandemic.

2021-02-06 12:02:15+00:00,19,"Editor’s note, January 10, 2022: This article was originally published in February 2021, and public health guidance around masking to prevent Covid-19 transmission may have shifted. For Vox’s latest coverage on the pandemic, see here.

My favorite face mask is a sleek black cloth number — it goes with everything, it doesn’t chafe my face, and it’s sold in a relatively affordable three-pack, so I always have a backup. I have a whole collection of cloth masks, like you probably do, cobbled together at random, in bright colors and patterns, generally homemade by an assortment of people in my life.

Yet, as we’ve slipped into allowing our face coverings to project our tastes while they protect us, there’s another element of style that’s often forgotten: fit. And fit is incredibly important when it comes to how effective our masks are.

Tons of celebrities have been seen out with their masks underneath their noses. Notably, members of Congress who promote masking up have been seen pulling up their sliding masks in public.

Cloth masks sometimes lend themselves to poor etiquette: Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) slipped his down to sneeze into his hand on C-SPAN, which is, to put it plainly, horrifying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is known to have masks that match her outfits but was once photographed in a conversation with George Floyd’s brother, mask hanging down below her mouth. And soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden’s mask slipped down his face in the midst of signing an executive action related to Covid-19. It happens to the best of us. Walk around anywhere in pandemic America, and you’ll surely encounter people fiddling with their masks.

But in order to truly protect you, cloth masks need to have a snug fit. And wearing a well-fitted mask might be more important than it’s ever been in the pandemic. As previously reported by Julia Belluz for Vox, a more contagious new variant of Covid-19, known as B.1.1.7, that’s now spreading around the world, should make us even more cautious about our risk of exposure to the virus, especially in indoor spaces.

Mask fit really matters

Proper mask-wearing remains a key factor in preventing the transmission of the coronavirus. A mask slip can leave the wearer extremely vulnerable, as the nasal passage is a common entryway for the virus to get into the body. According to a study in Nature Medicine, the virus attaches to certain proteins found in the nasal passage. There are actually more of these proteins in the nose than in the lungs, making an exposed nose a serious threat. You don’t want any viral particles getting to your nose, so it’s imperative that your mask has a tight fit.

Cloth masks are still fine for the general public to use, experts tell me, so don’t feel like you have to run out and buy a medical-grade mask like an N95. We think about what our masks look like every day, but we are largely ignoring the importance of the proper fit. There’s not enough emphasis on what makes a mask well-fitted and effective — we’ve gotten distracted with design, when really we need to be worrying about how comfortable our masks are and whether or not they are secure enough to rely on.

The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force, a research group based out of Cambridge University, investigates the efficacy and improvement of civilian face masks and fabrics. “What we found through our research is that the actual filtration material is not as important as fit. In order to get any benefit from a high filtration material, you have to have fit,” Eugenia O’Kelly, a PhD student who heads the group, said. O’Kelly emphasized that without highly specialized machinery, there is no way to be 100 percent sure your mask fits, but did have tips for improved fit and protection.

According to her team’s tests, double masking can be helpful. “Keep in mind, you do not end up numerically doubling your protection by layering masks. I have seen a lot of this type of ‘math’ online, but unfortunately, this is not how depth filtration works,” she said. But doubling up can ensure you get a better seal around the nose and mouth than one mask alone that might be a bit too loose. According to the new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released February 10, well-fitted surgical masks or a “cloth and surgical mask combination” can reduced virus transmission by up to 96.5 percent. The director of the CDC has also urged Americans to wear a mask with “two or more layers,” the New York Times reports.

O’Kelly says there are two methods scientists use to find out if a mask fits. “You can have quantitative fitting and qualitative fitting. In quantitative fitting, you are measuring the amount of particles inside and outside of the mask,” she said. Most surgical masks don’t fit tightly enough, or are made of material without sufficient filtration, so they won’t pass.

Quantitative fitting can be expensive because it requires specialized hospital equipment. “More common is qualitative mask fitting,” she said, for which her team is experimenting with using aroma diffusers as a test. If you are wearing a mask and can taste the particles through it, it’s a sign that your mask is ill-fitting.

In order to identify if your mask is good at protecting others, O’Kelly recommends avoiding masks with the following characteristics:

Thin material: If you can see any gaps between the fibers when you hold it to the light, that is a sign that viruses can get through. Single-layer: If your mask only has one (or even two) layers of fabric, the filtration is probably not high. The best masks have multiple layers or have a pocket to insert a filter, such as a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter. Poor fit: Fit is very important in a mask’s success, as you can read about in this recent study. You may not be able to get a mask that fits you perfectly, but the more and larger the gaps you see, the poorer the fit is. This may be more important when protecting the wearer than others. Discomfort: If the mask is very uncomfortable, you may be less likely to wear it correctly, and more likely to touch the outside of the mask or adjust it while out and about.

So how should a mask fit? “The mask should be a good fit over the nose and mouth, but not overly tight to impair breathing. It is not intended to filter out all the air one breathes, but intended to hold back droplets from our mouth from spreading in the air,” George Abraham, the chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine’s Infectious Disease Board, tells me.

There’s not a lot we can do to prevent a mask from falling down — except maybe try to find a mask that fits better.

O’Kelly also recommends doing a fit check, although there is no reliable way to currently assess the fit of fabric masks. “Move your hand around the edges of the mask where it makes contact with your skin and see if you can feel any air. If you feel the air, there is a gap,” she said. But just because a mask has a gap does not mean it’s totally ineffective. It just means it’s not providing the maximum level of protection possible. According to O’Kelly, a fabric mask with fit issues can protect the user from over 50 percent of particles, and well-constructed fabric masks with gaps still can filter over 75 percent of particles.

In a Consumer Reports article, William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, recommends tightening your mask if it slips off your nose. You can adjust the strings and make sure there isn’t any space for air on the sides. Our best bet is selecting a mask that fits properly: snug around the nose and mouth without gaps at the sides. A wire nose bridge can help your mask mold to your face. The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force’s studies have found that a metal nose band can improve fit. However, in less structured or elastic masks, that nose band can also harm performance, so the user has to make a judgment call.

But shouldn’t we just get N95s?

As comforting as it might be that experts say cloth masks are sufficient, the United States is far behind countries like Austria, where the government provides FFP2 masks to citizens, and Taiwan, where the government has been providing citizens with high-quality masks that are probably going to fit better than some of the cloth masks in circulation. Why can’t the same happen here in the United States?

The argument for the government to supply masks is not new. It might do Americans well to have better PPE, but there are a lot of caveats that come with the use of heavy-duty masks like the N95. In an email, Abraham told me that it would be difficult for the government to make sure that everyone had an effective N95. “The wearer needs to be ‘fit-tested’ so that the mask being used is not leaking but forms a good seal on the face, or else the ability of the mask to filter is lost,” he wrote. “As a practical reality, that is not consistently possible with the general public.”

There are ways to test the N95 — “you could place both hands around the rim of the mask, once on the face, and blow hard into it. If you feel air on your hands, you know the mask is not a tight fit,” Abraham explains. But according to experts, it is also not 100 percent accurate.

The N95 masks are a must for health care workers because they’re great for long exposure situations, but they might be excessive for short-term use, according to Abraham. An N95 mask might be more appropriate for a long plane ride, for example, instead of a quick run to the grocery store. “The use of the mask would be inconsistent, without doing a fit check every time,” Abraham said, and it would be “cost-prohibitive and accomplish little.” The government couldn’t regulate the N95 use of every civilian, and the respirators would be rendered useless if not properly fitting.

While the research O’Kelly’s group has done on mask materials is still being peer-reviewed, she says that even a mask with poor fit is better than not wearing one at all. “If you can see a gap at all, your mask is probably not functioning at 100 percent. However, that certainly does not mean the mask is useless if there are gaps.” Any kind of gap can compromise the effectiveness of a mask, so it is important to try to make sure there are no spaces if possible.

So next time you find yourself tugging at your face mask all day, consider finding another style or model that may work better. For extra protection, spend a little more money to get a mask with a pocket to add a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter, and shop around to get multiple masks that you can fit check at home. Mask slipping plagues us, but if we work at it, we can ward off the actual plague. It might take some trial and error, but this is worth getting right.",voxdotcom,"['nose', 'fits', 'important', 'masks', 'mask', 'fit', 'filter', 'better', 'face', 'air', 'cloth', 'vs', 'n95', 'answer']",0
2021-02-05 22:44:44+00:00,29,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been bad for the United States economy, but not as bad as some experts and economists feared early on in the outbreak. The recovery, though, is uneven — and it’s slowing.

In January, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent, and the country added just 49,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate is lower than it was pre-pandemic, as many Americans left the workforce. America is also still millions of jobs short of where it was pre-pandemic.

“This morning’s employment report revealed a stall in the American job creation machine and underscores how precarious of a situation our economy is in,” Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein said in a White House briefing on Friday. “Lack of job growth is a result of our failure to act appropriately in response to this immense dual crisis, and our economy and our families can’t afford for us to fail to act once again.”

How the country is experiencing the economy varies widely, and how workers are experiencing the pandemic differs, too. Life is much better for the wealthier segment of workers than it is for those at the bottom, and the top-line figures camouflage the realities of what people are dealing with in their day-to-day lives.

But digging in deeper on the numbers is worthwhile. Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard has estimated that for workers in the top wage quartile, unemployment has fallen below 5 percent; meanwhile, for those in the bottom wage quartile, that number is likely more than 20 percent. Many of these workers have access to expanded unemployment insurance, but the system is difficult to navigate. It’s not clear when benefits will end as Congress continues to haggle over more stimulus.

Higher-income (and often white) workers are more often able to work from home. Not only are they less likely to lose money from pandemic job losses, they’re saving money because there are fewer opportunities to spend. Meanwhile, lower-income (and often Black and brown) workers have either been deemed “essential,” meaning they’re putting their health at risk to get paid, or they’re out of work. A restaurant job is hard to come by when so many restaurants aren’t open.

What we’re seeing is a K-shaped economic recovery, one where certain segments of the population are doing much better than everyone else. For those at the top of the K, life — at least as far as having a job — is decent. Those at the bottom, not so much. The Covid-19 pandemic has made the realities of the disparities among workers in America more evident than ever.

“All recessions hit low- and middle-income people harder, they disproportionately hit people of color,” said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the Department of Labor. “Recessions always exacerbate existing inequalities, but this one is just doing that more than we’ve ever seen before.”

Understanding what’s happening to workers during the pandemic entails understanding how uneven the situation is. Black and Latinx workers face a different horizon than white workers, women are experiencing a different scenario than men, and in some cases, the people who can work from home are directly affecting the workers who can’t. If a Manhattan coffee cart guy depends on office workers for business, what happens when those people are now working from their Brooklyn couches?

“The basic story of the K-shaped recovery has just been staring us in the face for a long time,” said Michael Stepner, an economist and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard research project Opportunity Insights. “It’s unrealistic to think that these jobs are going to be restored while the pandemic is raging.”

Vox took a look at seven sets of data that help tell the story of how unevenly American workers are experiencing the current economy. The following charts tell a stark story about inequality in the country — inequality that has been made worse by the pandemic in some of the most vulnerable populations.

The pandemic has slammed Black workers

The unemployment rate for Black workers consistently lags behind white workers, and during the pandemic, that reality has been exacerbated. When the overall unemployment rate spiked to 14.8 percent in April, it was at 14.1 percent for white workers, while Black workers saw rates of 16.7 percent, and Latinx workers hit 18.9 percent. (Asian workers were about even with white workers, at 14.5 percent.) The jobs recovery has been much swifter for white workers than workers of color. Unemployment for whites dipped back below 10 percent in July; for Black workers, that didn’t happen until December. And in January, the unemployment rate for Black workers was at 9.2 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for whites — a larger spread than pre-pandemic.

Congressional inaction on unemployment benefits has the potential to do outsized harm to Black workers and other workers of color, and if policymakers don’t look at those groups’ jobs situation specifically, they don’t shape policy accordingly. “The gains that Black workers have made since the Great Recession were basically wiped out in the first couple of months of Covid,” Janelle Jones, who the Biden administration has tapped as chief economist at the Department of Labor, told Vox in an interview last year. She noted that if the national unemployment rate was what it was for Black workers, “we would not be taking our foot off the gas.”

There’s a Covid-induced “she-cession”

Most recessions tend to have an outsized impact on male workers — the Great Recession, for example, hit male-dominated industries such as manufacturing and construction. The Covid-19 economy, however, has been quite different: It’s been devastating for women.

Women make up the majority of the workforce in some sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality, and child care, and often, these workers are women of color. And even where those jobs have come back, women aren’t being brought back at the same rates as their male counterparts, said Jasmine Tucker, the director of research at the National Women’s Law Center. “Employers are making choices about who needs the money and who they’re going to keep,” she said. “I think there are still some misconceptions about women not being breadwinners ... but the opposite is true.”

Many women have dropped out of the workforce altogether. With schools closed because of the pandemic, the burden of child care disproportionately falls on women in many families. “We can’t talk about getting back to work without talking about investing in child care,” Tucker said.

Bernstein, the Biden economic adviser, addressed the unique nature of how the pandemic has affected women in his reaction to the jobs report on Friday: “This larger decrease for women is unusual in a recession and likely reflects both the industries this pandemic has hit — tourism, services, face-to-face industries, leisure and hospitality, restaurants — and increased care responsibilities that have been pulling women out of the labor force.”

Shierholz warned that women risk being hit by a second round of layoffs if federal aid for states and cities doesn’t come through — an issue that’s been a major sticking point for Republicans in stimulus negotiations. “In a second wave, public sector workers get hit, and that disproportionately hits women,” she said. “So then you’ll see women’s recovery happening much more slowly because there’s this countervailing force dragging them down.”

Last month, 275,000 women ages 20 and over left the workforce, compared with a decline of 71,000 men. There were about 2.4 million fewer women in that age group in the labor force in January 2021 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, there were 1.8 million fewer men, meaning that women have left the workforce at a higher rate than men.

The higher the educational attainment, the more stable the job situation

Higher-educated workers continue to fare better during the Covid-19 outbreak than those with lower levels of educational attainment. In January, the unemployment rate for those with less than a high school diploma was at 9.1 percent; for high school graduates, it was at 7.1 percent. For those with some college, the unemployment rate was 6.2 percent, and for those with at least a bachelor’s degree, it was 4 percent.

This is similar to what happened during the Great Recession, though as the Pew Research Center notes, one different factor now is how important the ability to work from home is for people to be able to stay on the job. According to its research, people with college degrees are six times as likely to be able to work from home as those without a high school degree — and in a scenario where so many in-person jobs have been shed, that makes a difference.

Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs website Indeed, said in an interview that some high-wage sectors such as finance and tech did some layoffs early in the pandemic, though they were likelier to pause hiring. Jobs listings in those areas have started to pick up a bit now, in large part because of the vaccine rollout, which is the key to getting the economy back to normal. “They’re focused on the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

Working from home has been bad for people whose jobs depend on others going into the office

In metropolitan areas where a higher percentage of workers can work from home, the number of job postings is down 13 percent from where they were pre-pandemic, according to data from Indeed. That’s compared to metro areas overall where postings have mostly recovered.

“The biggest surprise has been the effect in big, rich cities — tech hubs, financial centers,” Kolko said. Part of that decline in jobs has to do with a concentration of arts and entertainment in those areas. But more of the decline in places like New York, Boston, DC, and the Bay Area has to do with so many people working from home and, by extension, not spending as much time and money on services near where they normally went into the office. For example, if people aren’t going into work, they’re also not spending money on lunch out or haircuts after work near their offices.

“Ironically, even though it is very fortunate to have a job where you can work from home, some of the people and businesses who have suffered most are those who work in businesses that depend on customers who are now working from home,” Kolko said. “New York and the Bay Area are among the areas with the biggest job losses, even though they are richer places, and richer people have generally done better in this pandemic.”

Tourism and hospitality industries have tanked while jobs related to online delivery have grown

Job postings are down the most in industries directly affected by the coronavirus, like hospitality and tourism (down 38 percent since the pandemic began), which stay-at-home orders have in large part crushed, according to data from Indeed.

Jobs in tech and finance have largely recovered to where they were. Jobs related to online ordering like loading and stocking (30 percent) and driving (17 percent), are higher than they had been. Similarly, job postings for pharmacies, which are considered essential businesses and which people go to because of the coronavirus, are up.

The trend even holds within some sectors. Stepner, the Harvard economist, pointed out that consumer retail spending has now recovered, but how that’s translating into jobs is uneven — high-wage retail workers have gotten their jobs back; low-wage retail workers haven’t. “There’s actually been a reorientation of the retail sector toward large online retailers like Amazon and toward big-box stores, and those are the types of companies that are designed around ruthless efficiency,” he said.

Higher-paying jobs have had a better recovery

Employment rates for jobs where people make $27,000 a year or less are down 22.5 percent from where they were pre-pandemic, according to data from Opportunity Insights, the nonprofit research group at Harvard. Employment in middle-wage jobs, defined as making $27,000 to $60,000 a year, is down about 5 percent. Meanwhile, employment rates for people who make more than $60,000 a year are actually up about 3 percent. As such, job losses from the coronavirus pandemic serve to exacerbate existing job inequality. People in higher-income jobs not only make more, they’re more likely to be employed.

A bigger portion of the workforce was unionized in 2020 — because more non-unionized people lost their jobs

Another effect of coronavirus job losses? The share of people in unions went up for the first time in more than a decade.

Even though the total number of jobs represented by a union went down by 444,000 in 2020, union jobs made up a larger share of total jobs, 12.1 percent, up half a percentage point from 2019. That’s because, thanks to union protections, people with union jobs were more likely than non-union workers to keep their jobs. A similar thing happened in the last recession.

2021-02-05 18:33:02+00:00,32,"America’s Covid-19 epidemic is still a disaster. The country is averaging more than 130,000 new cases a day, and deaths are still above 3,000 daily. The vaccine rollout isn’t going as smoothly as anyone would like, and most people still don’t know when they’ll be able to get a vaccine.

But for the first time while covering the pandemic, I’m feeling just a little more optimistic this week — for two big reasons.

First, the number of daily new Covid-19 cases in the US has plummeted dramatically in the past month by an astonishing 45 percent since early January.

Second, the pace of vaccinations has continued to climb steadily over the past few weeks, quadrupling the number of shots a day in a month’s time. The current pace is still not great or even good, but it’s a big step in the right direction.

There are caveats everywhere. The number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the US is still way too high; when controlling for population, the rates of both are still higher than that in most developed countries. The vaccine rollout is still going too slowly for the pandemic to end in the summer, as many of us want; the current pace puts us on track for reaching sufficient population protection as late as 2022. New virus variants from the UK, South Africa, and Brazil could lead to a spike in infections in the US, and offer a warning for possible future mutations.

“The post-holiday drop is good and so is the increasing vaccination rate,” Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, told me. “The concerning piece, though, is that we’re still seeing significant community transmission and a bit in the dark about how truly prevalent the new variants are.”

So things aren’t going great, but they’re getting better. In times filled with so much despair, it’s worth highlighting some of that progress.

1) Daily new Covid-19 cases have plummeted in the US

Here’s the first bit of good news: The surge of Covid-19 cases from the holiday season appears to be — finally — subsiding. According to Our World in Data, the US peaked at nearly 250,000 cases a day, based on a weekly rolling average, on January 8. Less than a month later, daily new cases are below 140,000 a day.

That amounts to a roughly 45 percent drop in just a few weeks.

This is likely a result of the country collectively responding to the holiday season surge, whether it’s new restrictions imposed by state and local governments over the past few months or the general public boosting adherence to precautions like masking and social distancing (especially now that Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve are over). Growing immunity to the virus, whether through getting sick or vaccinated, may be playing a role too.

By no stretch of the imagination should the drop in cases be taken to mean that the surge is completely over and the US can now relax. America’s reported caseload is still above what it was at any point in the pandemic before the fall. The death toll hasn’t come down much yet, likely because there’s a lag period between infection, serious illness, and death.

Any relaxation now, whether in government restrictions or public adherence, would likely result in another surge. There is still a lot of virus out there, ready to jump from person to person if given the opportunity. That’s especially true now as new, more infectious coronavirus variants await — putting us at risk of an even bigger surge than the one we saw during the holiday season if we ease up.

So maybe don’t host that big Super Bowl party this year.

2) The vaccine campaign is improving

The other bit of good news is America’s vaccine campaign has picked up pace and seems likely to continue doing so in the next few weeks and months.

At the start of January, the US was delivering around 300,000 shots a day. The country has since more than quadrupled that — with the US now above 1.3 million shots a day.

There’s good reason to think this will speed up in the coming weeks. President Joe Biden’s administration, state and local governments, and various parts of the medical system are working to ramp up production and distribution of vaccines. Upcoming vaccine candidates could also make the delivery and administration of vaccines easier and faster; for example, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which data suggests is effective, requires just one shot to administer, while the currently approved vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer each require two shots given weeks apart.

Still, there are some reasons to temper the optimism.

Perhaps most importantly, the current pace of vaccination means the country won’t reach sufficient population protection or herd immunity — estimated at 70 to 80 percent — until the fall, winter, or even 2022. And even that’s dependent on a vaccine getting approved for kids, which isn’t a sure thing yet. If vaccinations don’t pick up to 2 million or 3 million shots a day, the US won’t get that summer end to Covid-19 that many public officials have promised.

There’s also the question of whether vaccines stop transmission. Right now, the evidence shows vaccines prevent serious illness and death, but whether that translates to preventing the spread of the coronavirus is unknown. That doesn’t mean the vaccines don’t protect against transmission, it means it’s unclear whether they do or not. This could dictate just how good of a job the vaccines do at protecting the broader community above and beyond the person who gets the vaccine.

And we still don’t know how long the vaccines’ protection lasts. It could be months, years, or permanent. The situation is complicated by the rise of variants, which might eventually evolve to overcome a vaccine (though that doesn’t seem true for the current variants). Depending on the answer, the US may require regular vaccine campaigns against the coronavirus in the future, similar to the flu.

All of that is to say that there is still a lot of work to be done, both in administering shots and learning how effective the vaccines are, before the country can truly return to normal.

To put it another way: The fact we can now see some sort of finish line, between the drop in cases and vaccinations, makes it all the more important that the country sticks to masking, social distancing, and all the other recommended precautions against Covid-19 — to make sure more people can make it through that finish line alive and well.

But, if nothing else, at least the finish line seems a bit nearer now.

2021-02-05 18:00:37+00:00,37,"In a 50-49 party-line vote on Tuesday, Senate Democrats took a key step in setting up a contingency plan for Covid-19 relief, voting to begin work on a stimulus package passable without any buy-in from Republicans.

While it’s still possible there could be a bipartisan deal on a Covid-19 package, disagreement between the two parties on just how big a relief package should be has prompted Democrats to keep their options open. During the Tuesday vote, Democrats voted unanimously to begin debate on a budget resolution, the first step in kicking off the reconciliation process, which allows standard Senate procedure for most bills to be circumvented.

While Democrats would ordinarily need 60 votes to pass legislation, reconciliation would enable them to pass Covid-19 relief with a simple majority, or 51 votes. Even Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), long viewed as a key moderate swing vote and as someone hesitant to exclude Republicans from stimulus negotiations, was on board — an important sign that Democrats could have all the votes they need to approve more aid unilaterally.

“I will vote to move forward with the budget process because we must address the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis,” Manchin said in a statement explaining his decision, while noting that he favors a response narrowly targeted to the public health crisis. “I will only support proposals that will get us through and end the pain of this pandemic.”

The Tuesday vote has since triggered 50 hours of debate over the budget resolution, which will effectively serve as a blueprint for the final stimulus package. The resolution instructs Senate committees to write a budget bill that includes provisions of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief plan, including $1,400 direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment support, and expansions in food aid.

Since reconciliation is meant to be used only for tax- and spending-related measures, the ultimate budget bill is somewhat limited to Biden’s priorities that address these areas: There have been questions about whether an increase to the minimum wage could pass in this way, for example. And by taking this route, Democrats are signaling that they’re ready to go it alone if Republicans don’t back expansive relief.

“The work must move forward, preferably with our Republican colleagues, but without them, if we must,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has previously said.

What happens next

After the Senate wraps up 50 hours of debate on the budget resolution, lawmakers will finish considering amendments, and then get to work writing the reconciliation bill:

Every senator is able to file amendments, some of which will get voted on during a “vote-a-rama”: Senators are able to introduce budget-related amendments to the resolution, each of which will require 51 votes to pass. These amendments are voted on during a process known as a “vote-a-rama,” which will include back-to-back floor votes until lawmakers have considered all the amendments. This can take a while: Previous vote-a-ramas have gone until the early hours of the morning because of how many amendments there are.

Since Democrats have House and Senate control, the lower chamber is poised to approve the final version that the Senate passes.

Both chambers of Congress must approve the budget resolution for the process to move forward and for lawmakers to start crafting a budget reconciliation bill.

The resolution directs 11 Senate committees to write the bill, and to ensure that it includes the provisions of Biden’s Covid-19 package. The Senate then votes on the final bill: This final budget bill can pass with just 51 votes as well, giving Democrats the opportunity to pass it unilaterally.

Budget reconciliation enables Democrats to advance relief on their own

A group of Senate Republicans has offered a counterproposal for Covid-19 relief, but it includes less than a third of the aid that Biden’s $1.9 trillion proposal contains. Democrats have argued that the GOP proposal is too small; after meeting with Biden on Wednesday, Schumer said, “There’s agreement, universal agreement, we must go big and bold.”

Although it’s possible GOP lawmakers could be willing to make some concessions, the distance between the two plans suggests that Democrats may have to move forward without any Republican support should they want to “go big.”

Budget reconciliation would allow them to pass legislation without needing to make a lot of compromises on Biden’s proposal — so long as their caucus remains unified. With just 51 votes needed to pass reconciliation instead of the standard 60 votes needed for most bills, the 50-member Democratic caucus will need to stay united, allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to serve as a tiebreaker and the 51st vote in the event that all Republicans vote against the final bill.

Both parties have used budget reconciliation to advance their own priorities in the past, with Senate Republicans capitalizing on the process to pass massive tax cuts in 2017. As Schumer has noted, the process has also been used with bipartisan support 17 times since 1980, including to advance the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

With debate now underway — and the need for more aid remaining pressing, given the housing and unemployment crises — Democrats appear ready to move forward on coronavirus relief even if Republicans don’t sign on.",voxdotcom,"['resolution', 'bill', 'amendments', 'senate', 'votes', 'pass', 'covid19', 'process', 'begun', 'vote', 'democrats', 'budget', 'relief', 'reconciliation']",0
2021-02-05 16:00:12+00:00,17,"More than a million Americans have died of Covid-19, and the World Health Organization estimated this Thursday that the global death toll is around 15 million — a horrifying, and largely unnecessary, tragedy.

But for all that the world has lost in the last few years, the history of infectious disease has a grim message: It could have been even worse. That appalling death toll resulted even though the coronavirus kills only about 0.7 percent of the people it infects. Imagine instead that it killed 30 percent — and that it would take centuries, instead of months, to develop a vaccine against it. And imagine that instead of being deadliest in the elderly, it was deadliest for young children.

That’s smallpox.

This image contains sensitive or violent content Tap to display

The horrors of the past year have given us a brief glimpse into what it’s like to live in a world ravaged by infectious disease. It’s easy to take for granted now that very few babies in rich countries die of disease in infancy, that most infectious diseases are treatable, and that there are vaccines available when we need them. But humanity only made the transition into that new world fairly recently.

Smallpox eradication was a major part of that. Over the course of the 20th century, country after country fought it back. The World Health Assembly declared on May 8th, 1980 that it was gone for good. Its gradual eradication meant ending the needless suffering and death of millions and millions of people every year.

It’s not minimizing the suffering wrought by the coronavirus pandemic — or forgiving the negligence that made the Covid-19 death toll so much higher than it needed to be — to take a step back and realize that diseases can be much more contagious, and much deadlier, than this one. And there’s something reassuring about the fact that, at least in the case of smallpox, humanity eventually rose to the challenge.

With luck, aggressive vaccination, and ambitious international coordination, we made the toll of infectious disease lower than at any point in history, and though it won’t be easy, we can do it again. As we learn how to address current and future pandemics, it is worth understanding what we learned from the great infectious disease fights of the past.

Smallpox, explained

Smallpox has been around for a very long time. It’s believed that pharaohs died of it in ancient Egypt. It devastated the Americas in the early 1500s after being introduced through contact with Europe. It altered the course of the Revolutionary War, with outbreaks in New England that cost the Continental Army the Battle of Quebec.

Its toll throughout history is hard to measure, but in the 20th century alone it is estimated to have killed between 300 million and 500 million people. “In the contest of Smallpox versus War, War lost,” D.A. Henderson, former director of disease surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote in his 2009 book Smallpox: The Death of a Disease, noting that even the most devastating wars of the 20th century — World War I and World War II — had a combined death toll much smaller than that of smallpox.

Smallpox was spread by a virus (technically, two viruses: Variola major and the significantly less common Variola minor). It caused fever, then a rash, which over the course of a few days developed into the skin-covering lumps that are the disease’s trademark. The more serious strain, Variola major, killed about 30 percent of people infected with it, with even higher death rates in infants. Death usually occurred within eight to 16 days.

Variola minor had similar symptoms but was much less deadly, with death rates around 1 percent. No effective treatments were discovered by the time the disease was eradicated.

A year ago, most people were unaware of epidemiological statistics like a disease’s R0 (the number of people that an infected person will infect in a population without immunity), and a disease’s “case fatality rate” (the percentage of sick people who die). But the Covid-19 pandemic prompted an epidemiological crash course for many of us, which ought to give us a new perspective on the horror of smallpox.

The disease, like Covid-19, was primarily transmitted through close contact, especially in indoor spaces. Our best estimate, though, is that it had an infectiousness between 5 and 7, putting it between that of Covid’s delta (4) and omicron variants (8). Due to smallpox’s high R0 and the devastating mortality rate, it was not uncommon for an outbreak of smallpox in an area without preexisting immunity to kill 30 percent of everyone in the community. In some contexts, such as when it spread through the Americas after being introduced by Europeans, the death rate is believed to have been even higher.

How we eradicated smallpox

Before modern vaccine development, humans had to get creative in slowing the spread of infectious disease. It was known that people who’d survived smallpox didn’t get sick again. In China, as early as the 15th century, healthy people deliberately breathed smallpox scabs through their noses and contracted a milder version of the disease. Between 0.5 percent and 2 percent died from such self-inoculation, but this represented a significant improvement on the 30 percent mortality rate of the disease itself.

In England, in 1796, doctor Edward Jenner demonstrated that contracting cowpox — a related but much milder virus — conferred immunity against smallpox, and shortly after that, immunization efforts began in earnest across Europe. By 1813, the US Congress passed legislation to ensure the availability of a smallpox vaccine that reduced smallpox outbreaks in the country throughout the 1800s.

In the rest of the world, similar efforts were undertaken, with varying levels of commitment and success. In 1807, Bavaria declared vaccination for smallpox mandatory. In 1810, Denmark followed. Cases fell across Europe. Efforts by the British Empire to conduct a smallpox vaccination program in India made less progress, due in large part to mistrust by the locals of the colonial government.

By 1900, smallpox was no longer quite as much of a scourge in the world’s richest countries. In the 1800s, about 1 in 13 deaths in London were caused by smallpox; by 1900, smallpox caused only about 1 percent of deaths. Several countries in Northern Europe had also declared the disease eradicated. Over the next few decades, more of Europe, and then the US and Canada, joined them.

But as long as smallpox ravaged other parts of the globe, continual vaccination was necessary to make sure it wasn’t reintroduced, and millions of people continued to die of it. Data is spotty — this is before there was any international authority on infectious disease statistics worldwide — but it is estimated that 10 to 15 million people caught smallpox annually, with 5 million dying of it, during the first half of the 20th century.

It was not until the 1950s that a truly global eradication effort began to appear within reach, thanks to new postwar international institutions. The World Health Organization (WHO), founded in 1948, led the charge and provided a framework for countries that were not always on friendly terms to collaborate on global health efforts.

Even then, there were skeptics. “One hurdle the Eradicators faced was skepticism within the scientific community,” Henderson writes, “about the feasibility and practicality of eradicating an infectious disease.”

After all, no disease had ever been eradicated before. There were billions of people in the world, under myriad governments, many of them in regions actively at war. Global coordination on the scale eradication would demand was unprecedented. Plus, there had already been a failed attempt to eradicate malaria. The goal of eliminating every smallpox case in the world, rather than just suppressing the virus, sounded implausibly lofty.

“There was no shortage of people telling [the people involved in the eradication effort] that their effort was futile and they were hurting their career chances,” former CDC director William Foege wrote in his 2011 book House on Fire about the smallpox eradication effort.

But other advances had brought it within reach. Needle technology had improved, with new bifurcated needles making it possible to use less vaccine. Overseas travel improved, which made it easier to ship vaccines and get public health workers where they were most needed, and provided impetus for worldwide eradication as it made it more likely that a smallpox outbreak anywhere in the world could spread.

A 1947 outbreak in New York City, traced back to a traveler from Mexico, resulted in a frantic effort to vaccinate 6 million people in four weeks. Europe, Henderson says, repeatedly saw the virus reintroduced by travelers from Asia, with 23 distinct importations (different occasions of someone bringing smallpox into the country) in five years.

As we face down Covid-19, with effective vaccinations finally in hand, we’re encountering the same challenge that the world faced with smallpox in the 1950s: It doesn’t matter if a vaccine exists unless there also exists the international will and creativity to get it to all the people who need it, many of whom will be reluctant and skeptical.

As Henderson and Foege detail in their books, there were extraordinary challenges that often looked utterly insurmountable in the quest to eradicate smallpox. In poor corners of the world, there were no roads or hospitals and no infrastructure to notify the WHO of a smallpox outbreak. Civil wars, famines, and refugee crises made disease surveillance and vaccination very difficult.

But other features of smallpox made it easier to eradicate than many other diseases. For one thing, it didn’t have animal reservoirs; that is, unlike diseases like Ebola, smallpox doesn’t live in animal populations that can reintroduce the disease in humans. That meant that once it was destroyed in humans, it would be gone forever. And, once a person has survived it, they are immune for life. Only one vaccine is needed for immunity in almost all cases.

Additionally, it largely doesn’t have asymptomatic transmission and has a fairly long incubation period of about a week. That made it possible for public health officials to stay on top of the disease with a strategy of “ring vaccination” — whenever a case was reported, vaccinating every single person who may have come into contact with the affected person, and ideally everyone in the community could keep the disease at bay.

Henderson calls the switch to ring vaccination a pivotal strategic change for the fight against smallpox. Instead of fighting for 100 percent vaccination, which was proving unachievable in low-income countries, it let public health teams focus their resources where they were needed most.

Related Be thankful you were born after the smallpox vaccine

As large parts of the world were declared smallpox-free, resources could be more intensively focused in the areas where outbreaks were still happening. While in 1950 a smallpox outbreak in a developing country might attract little international interest, by 1970 it attracted the world’s best disease surveillance and response resources. Contact tracers tried to identify everyone exposed and figure out where the virus might have come from. Communities were swiftly vaccinated. Case numbers kept declining.

In 1975, the world marked the last wild Variola major case, in Bangladesh. In 1977, it marked the last wild Variola minor case, in Somalia. Doctors tracked down and vaccinated every potential contact of the case; none of them contracted the disease. Surveillance around the world found no more cases anywhere.

Two years later, on May 8th, 1980, the World Health Assembly declared victory over smallpox.

Lessons for the present, and the future

Humanity’s triumph over smallpox should stand out as one of our proudest moments. It called on scientists and researchers from around the world, including collaborations between rival countries in the middle of the Cold War.

Unfortunately, we’ve never replicated that success against another virus that affects humans. With some, such as polio, we’re drawing close. Wild polio has been eradicated in Africa and remains only in conflict-torn regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. “Ring vaccination,” as practiced in the smallpox battle, has been successfully used in public health efforts against other diseases, most recently with the new Ebola vaccine, used against outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

But in other cases, like HIV and Covid-19, we’ve let new diseases grow to pandemic proportions. And while those diseases have had devastating effects, it’s worth keeping in mind that they could have been even worse. Some viruses with the potential to escape laboratories or make the jump from animals to humans are as deadly and transmissible as smallpox, and Covid-19 has made it clear that we’re not prepared to handle them.

Why has it been so hard to build on our success with smallpox? One part of it is that many diseases present all the challenges that smallpox did — plus some additional ones. Some, like malaria or Ebola, have animal reservoirs, which means that ensuring no humans are sick isn’t sufficient to stamp them out. Some, like HIV or Covid-19, have asymptomatic transmission, which makes disease surveillance trickier. (An important public health clarification: HIV can be transmitted by people who don’t feel sick, which is “asymptomatic transmission,” but it cannot be transmitted by people whose virus levels are undetectable through medication management.)

But as far as things that we can control, there are some takeaways. The first is that the smallpox eradication program took both heroic efforts and a well-funded, well-supported public health system. People trying to do disease surveillance and vaccination in war-torn, dangerous, remote parts of the world are risking their lives in our current fight. They can only succeed if their efforts are matched by a commitment by governments of rich countries not to leave poor countries behind, to meet the funding needs of an eradication project, and not to undermine one with CIA spy operations that imitate vaccine campaigns.

“The coronavirus we are grappling with today is not smallpox,” Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, said in December 2020, but “those old enough to remember the story of smallpox eradication” will recognize many of the lessons we’re rapidly learning now, from the importance of vaccine distribution and infrastructure to the essential role of international coordination and leadership at the World Health Organization.

A global Covid-19 suppression effort — and a better response to future pandemics —requires a CDC and WHO that is well-funded, attracts top scientific talent, and isn’t subject to political manipulation that gets in the way of accurate disease surveillance.

Another critical takeaway is that once the work has succeeded, we have to make sure never to undermine it. After telling the history of the eradication of smallpox, Henderson’s account switches to a different theme: the vials remaining in the hands of governments. He wants them destroyed lest some accident or malicious act unleash smallpox on the world again. There have already been a few close calls. A year after smallpox was declared eradicated, bad lab safety procedures led to another outbreak in Birmingham in the UK. Just a few years ago, improperly stored smallpox vials were found in a lab in the US. We need to take biosecurity and pathogen research much more seriously.

In the broader context of humanity’s fight against infectious disease, it’s fair to think of the coronavirus as a close call. As bad as it has been, it could have been much worse. It could have been more transmissible; it could have been deadlier. Diseases far worse than Covid-19 have appeared throughout human history, and there’s every reason to believe we may someday face one again.

The devastation of Covid-19 has hopefully made us aware of the work public health experts and epidemiologists do, the crucial role of worldwide coordination and disease surveillance programs (which are still underfunded), and the horrors that diseases can wreak when we can’t control them.

We have to do better. The history of the fight against smallpox proves that we’re capable of it.",voxdotcom,"['smallpox', 'kill', 'health', 'eradication', 'covid19', 'millions', 'death', 'vaccination', 'disease', 'vaccine', 'beat', 'heres', 'world', 'humans', 'used', 'diseases']",0
2021-02-05 14:01:03+00:00,11,"Covid-19 plunged the United States into a recession, leaving millions of Americans out of work and hungry. In the middle of this crisis, the housing market boomed.

Between September 2019 and September 2020, homeowners accumulated a collective $1 trillion in additional home equity. The exploding demand of the past year, in conjunction with a historically low supply of housing, has led buyers to desperately bid up the prices of available properties, sending home prices soaring.

The boom has been welcome news for homeowners (about 65 percent of American households are owner-occupied), but it’s troubling for the growing number of Americans who are being shut out of the housing market altogether.

In a new Urban Institute report, researchers found that if the country continues down the same road, over the next two decades the US homeownership rate is set to decline to 62.1 percent. The losses will be concentrated among younger people and Black Americans. When you break down the findings by age cohort, things look grim: Younger millennials will have a homeownership rate of 64 percent as opposed to the 72 percent of boomers who owned homes at their age. Further, the racial homeownership gap between Black and white Americans is set to increase among 55- to 64-year-olds from 28.9 percentage points to 33.3 percentage points.

These trends are part of a long-running failure to build enough homes for the people who need them, post-Great Recession credit-tightening, which has reduced the pool of potential homebuyers, and the effects of Covid-19 which have exacerbated all of these trends.

So by all accounts the housing market is booming, but inequality is, too.

How Covid-19 affected the demand for housing

Across the country, housing prices are rising — quickly.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price NSA Index, which tracks price changes of single-family homes, indicates that in November 2020, housing prices had risen 9.5 percent from the previous November. At the end of 2019, the average home was worth around $245,000. It’s now worth more than $266,000, according to Zillow.

This is a huge increase, and there are a few factors behind it.

The price of a house is tied to the supply and demand for housing: If there are fewer houses available, prospective buyers bid up the price in order to get one; if fewer people are looking for a home, the price will drop because buyers have fewer competitors. Covid-19 has affected both supply and demand.

Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, told me that she believes the increase in home values is mostly a demand story: People are scrambling to take advantage of plummeting mortgage rates that make the cost of buying a home much cheaper.

Due to falling mortgage rates, the cost of borrowing money to buy a house is dropping. Mortgage rates have been falling steadily for a while, but they fell dramatically in 2020 — reaching a record low of 2.65 percent in January 2021.

This is a big deal. Let’s say you bought a $300,000 house a year ago, before Covid-19 hit the US. If you locked in a 3.73 percent mortgage rate, you’d end up paying $498,940 over 30 years. If you bought it in 2020 at the low of 2.67 percent, you’d pay $436,337, a savings of more than $60,000.

So this is inducing a lot of the demand right as America’s biggest generation ever, millennials, have aged into their prime homebuying years. Data suggests that people who can take advantage of the rates are doing so. The Mortgage Bankers Association data shows that “mortgage applications for new home purchases increased 33 percent compared to a year ago” in August and 27.1 percent in November compared to a year ago. In September, the typical home sold in only 16 days, down from 28 days a year earlier. And roughly two-thirds of people who bought a home in 2020 made an offer on a house that they had never seen in person.

People who were on the edge about buying a home have jumped into the market; some of these people are first-time homebuyers or buying second homes, both of whom add considerable pressure to the market since they’re not putting up a home for sale as they take one off the market. Moreover, many people are choosing to just refinance their mortgage at the new, lower rate rather than deal with trying to find a new home in such a competitive environment.

A June National Bureau of Economic Research paper by researchers from the University of Chicago estimated that 37 percent of jobs, a share concentrated among high-paying jobs, can be performed entirely remotely. During the pandemic, many of them have been remote for the first time.

Long-running preferences for more space intensified as Covid-19 forced people to spend more time at home. It also reduced the value of urban amenities when restaurants, indoor gatherings with friends who live nearby, cultural exhibits, and more are unavailable. These simultaneous pressures have seen people moving to suburban environments, opting for yards and extra space to accommodate simultaneous work and school.

“We’re calling this the Great Reshuffling,” Zillow economist Matthew Speakman told Vox. “It’s changed the way people think about where they need to live, and it’s changed their definition of home.”

Still, reports of the death of cities have been greatly exaggerated. Property prices in cities are still rising with some exceptions like San Francisco, New York City, and Boston. Whether they continue to rise depends on how much remote work sticks around, and how much people actually value the amenities living in a city provides, when they can actually access them.

There aren’t enough homes

The other factor driving housing values is supply: how many homes there are available to buy — both newly built and those being sold by their existing owners.

It’s not a new problem — but it’s yet another issue Covid-19 has made worse.

“Even going into the pandemic, there was a shortage of homes for sale,” Fairweather told Vox. “From 2010-2019 [we] had the lowest amount of homes built than in any decade since the 1960s.”

Covid-19 made this worse in a few ways. First, during any financial downturn, some people are reluctant to make big changes due to the uncertainty in their lives. That means people who might have listed their homes chose not to this year; others took their homes off the market as Covid-19 spread across the country. Covid-19 also made people nervous to show their homes: You likely don’t want strangers traipsing through your living room as a little-understood but highly contagious disease runs rampant through your community.

Michael Neal, senior research associate at the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center (HFPC), believes that low supply is “probably the biggest contributor” to the rapid rise in prices.

By the end of 2020, there were only 2.5 months of supply left of housing, according to the Urban Institute. Simply put, “at the current sales pace, the inventory of homes nationwide will be exhausted” in just a few months, limiting the supply even more.

Even with technological improvements to the home-selling process, like 3D home tours, there are still many fewer homes on the market this year than last.

Long-running supply issues are in large part due to onerous regulations at the local level that artificially restrict the amount of housing that can be built, from single-family zoning that makes it illegal to build townhouses or apartments or condos on any land zoned for a single unit to parking minimums that require developers to use valuable land for parking spaces even where it’s unnecessary.

Additionally, the structure of local government allows small groups of (typically unrepresentative) people to block new development for a variety of concerns, from “neighborhood character” to the belief that low-income housing will drag down property values and even worries about the environmental impact of new development (although sprawl should be the bigger environmental concern).

In 2017, Yale Law professor David Schleicher wrote a paper called “Stuck! The Law and Economics of Residential Stagnation.” In it, he documents local restrictions on housing development, arguing they have become so overbearing that the increase in the cost of housing and rents has made moving to a better place impossible for millions of Americans. Local zoning regulations are strangling opportunity.

Experts and activists across the political spectrum disagree about how best to solve these problems — from a market-based vision of simply allowing as much market-rate housing as possible to left-leaning dreams of a public housing utopia.

But if we don’t figure out a way to build more housing where people need it, inequality will continue to skyrocket.

Homeownership is becoming an increasingly exclusive club

The soaring demand and constrained supply have been great news for homeowners who have seen their home values increase. And for those who have been able to take advantage of historically low mortgage rates, navigating the market may have been stressful, but they came out of it with a great deal.

But a growing share of Americans is shut out of the housing market together. Homeownership is becoming something akin to an exclusive club that forces patrons to pay an enormous cover charge to enter, while tens of millions are left out in the cold.

“Homeownership is the single best way to build wealth,” said Laurie Goodman, vice president at the Urban Institute and co-author of the new report on the future of homeownership. According to the US Census Bureau, the median net worth for a homeowner is 80 times that of a renter.

But the share of Americans who own homes has been falling. If it continues on the same path, over the next two decades, the US homeownership rate will decline from 64.7 percent to 62.1 percent, Goodman and her co-author found in their report, and those losses will be concentrated among Black Americans and young Americans. It will exacerbate current inequalities where “72 percent of non-Hispanic white households owned homes in 2018, compared with 57 percent of Asian households, 48 percent of Hispanic households, and 42 percent of Black households. Notably, the current homeownership rate for Black households is even lower than it was when fair housing laws were passed in 1968,” the researchers write.

Homeownership can confer great benefits — primarily wealth-building but also the stability in knowing your shelter isn’t at the whim of a landlord. Homeowners’ median wealth is nearly 90 times that of renters, in large part due to home equity. It can also allow you to borrow against the value of your house in tough times or to help your kids attend college or start a family.

Since the Great Recession, it’s become harder for lower-income people to purchase a home. The median FICO score for purchasing a home is now 45 points higher than it was before the housing crash. The 10th percentile, deemed the “lower bound of creditworthiness to qualify for a mortgage” is now 657; before the recession, it was below 600.

“Credit-worthiness” is also defined in ways that disproportionately harm low-income people: Right now, most credit bureaus count payments on existing debt, but not on-time rental and utility payments. And income is frequently not assessed properly for people without traditional employment, such as gig workers. Income and wealth inequality, which will be exacerbated by the past year where those at the higher end of the income ladder recovered quickly from the financial shock (and by some measures are even doing better) and those at the bottom end are facing permanent job losses, long-term housing insecurity, and food insecurity.

“It’s the two worlds right now,” Alanna McCargo, vice president of the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center, said during a panel discussion on the future of housing affordability. “There’s a whole lot of people that this pandemic is annoying or just a nuisance and then just a huge part of the population in this whole other place of distress and despair.”

The financial impact of Covid-19 has been concentrated among the least well-off. And even if lower- and middle-income people and people of color have remained financially stable over the past year, there are other structural barriers to homeownership, such as the fact that Black Americans and those who come from low-income backgrounds are less likely to get help with down payments or advice on navigating a complex process.

Some homeowners and recent buyers who have seen values soar during the pandemic might feel safe now. But in the end, everyone is hurt by skyrocketing housing prices and increasing levels of housing insecurity. As rents rise for people down the income ladder, inequality can have destabilizing effects for communities, as health and educational outcomes are closely tied to stable housing.

The last year was the clearest example yet of what can happen when we allow stable housing options to become scarce. The spread of Covid-19 among housing-insecure and homeless populations didn’t stay there — it affected entire communities through increased transmission rates and strained hospital resources.

There are several options we can explore to increase the homeownership rate and reduce racial and generational inequality, from loosening credit standards to enacting zoning reform and expanding financial education. It’s a crisis in many ways of our own making. So it’s up to us to unmake it.",voxdotcom,"['caused', 'urban', 'rate', 'housing', 'mortgage', 'americans', 'covid19', 'boom', 'homes', 'homeownership', 'market', 'recession', 'supply']",0
2021-02-05 13:01:35+00:00,12,"People who are pregnant are now eligible to get the coronavirus vaccine in more than 40 states — typically ahead of their lower-risk peers. And more than 60,000 of them have already rolled up their sleeves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Although the Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the US were not studied in pregnancy, early data is now starting to emerge suggesting — as researchers expected — that the vaccines are likely safe during pregnancy and confer protection not only to the recipient but also, potentially, the baby.

“It’s all very positive,” says Stephanie Gaw, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, of the findings so far.

There have been many reasons to suspect the vaccines should be safe in pregnancy, including the lack of major adverse events reported so far, solid studies in animals, and a good understanding of how the vaccines work in the body (they don’t contain live virus, and they are quickly broken down). “The data that we’re collecting on it so far has no red flags,” Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease doctor, said in February.

Second, in the USA more than 44,000 pregnant people have so far received an mRNA vaccine. Passive surveillance of these people has revealed no safety signal, and the same is true for active surveillance of 1,815 pregnant people through V-safe. 4/https://t.co/LrItWY3VOC pic.twitter.com/2YqHLUtKm8 — Viki Male (@VikiLovesFACS) March 15, 2021

Meanwhile, new research, published March 25 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that the vaccines offer strong immune protection for people who are pregnant, just like their non-pregnant peers.

Preliminary research also suggests vaccines might provide some protection to newborns, who are unlikely to have their own approved Covid-19 vaccine anytime soon (and are also vulnerable to more severe illness). The new AJOG paper joins other early findings that antibodies to Covid-19 generated by pregnant mothers after receiving their vaccines were passed through the placenta to the fetus.

But Covid-19 vaccine rollout to the pregnant population has been inconsistent around the globe.

For months, the US and many national medical groups — including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine — say the vaccine should be offered to this group, in large part because there’s strong evidence that pregnancy elevates the risk for severe Covid-19 and death. (Given this data, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine goes so far as to say the vaccine is “recommended” for those who are pregnant or considering pregnancy.)

“If a pregnant patient gets infected during pregnancy, her risk of intensive care admission is around 5 percent,” says David Baud, chief of obstetrics at Le Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois in Switzerland, where he studies infections during pregnancy. “I do not know of any disease that put a 30-year-old woman at such high risk to be admitted to the ICU.” Furthermore, if the infection happens late in pregnancy, it increases the risk of preterm birth and the baby needing intensive care.

Israel went as far as adding pregnant women to its vaccine priority list in January. But other countries, such as the UK and Germany, and the World Health Organization are still saying most people who are pregnant should wait.

Why the disagreement? The clinical trials of the new Covid-19 vaccines explicitly excluded pregnant people, and we don’t yet have enough follow-up data from individuals who have opted to get the shots to say for sure they are safe for everyone during pregnancy.

Add to this muddled landscape the persistent misinformation swirling around the Covid-19 vaccines and pregnancy and fertility, and it is little wonder some people are still confused or worried. And most organizations still stop short of advising all pregnant people to definitely get the vaccine.

Thankfully, these information gaps are starting to fill in. Numerous studies are underway following the outcomes of pregnant and breastfeeding people and their offspring after immunization. And a handful of them are now starting to report early, reassuring results.

In the meantime, however, a growing number of people have had to come to their own decision, with the optional help of their care provider, with some uncertainty. And no one needs an extra thing to stress about during a pandemic pregnancy.

So more information about the coronavirus vaccines in pregnancy can’t come soon enough.

4 reasons the coronavirus vaccine should be okay to get while pregnant — but why not everyone is recommending it yet

One of the big reasons why, despite Covid-19’s known risks in pregnancy, not everyone has unequivocally recommended the vaccines that currently have emergency approval in the US for pregnant people is that the way they work is fairly new. But we do have some key pieces of information already:

1) These vaccines don’t contain live coronavirus. The only types of vaccines that are contraindicated in pregnancy contain live virus that has been weakened, such as the chickenpox vaccine. (Even fewer immunizations, such as the smallpox vaccine, are not recommended during lactation.) While these vaccines don’t pose a risk to most people, there is a small, theoretical chance they could cross the placenta and infect the fetus.

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, on the other hand, contain just a fragment of genetic material, called messenger RNA, that can tell human cells to build a tiny part of the virus’s outer shell, which the immune system learns to recognize and fight off. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different method, known as a viral vector (the same platform as the already-used Zika and Ebola vaccines), to get the body to build part of the virus’s shell.

In either case, there is no way the vaccine can cause a Covid-19 infection.

2) The main coronavirus vaccines are very fragile. Once the mRNA enters the body, it likely only reaches local arm muscle cells before the body breaks it down. This means it is unlikely to enter the bloodstream, and even less likely to make it as far as the placenta. Even if it does get that far, “one of the placenta’s main functions is to be an immune barrier to the fetus,” which adds another layer of protection, says Gaw. And although it contains genetic material, it doesn’t enter our cells’ nuclei, meaning that it can’t cause any mutations to our cells — or those of a developing fetus. This mRNA is so fragile, vaccine developers had to wrap it in nanolipids (which are also presumed to be safe for pregnancy) just to keep it intact long enough to reach muscle cells in the arm.

Experts also expect it is unlikely for the mRNA to make its way intact into breast milk. Preliminary research from Gaw and her team, which is in the process of being peer-reviewed, found no trace of the vaccine itself in breast milk samples from hours and days post-vaccination. And even if a small amount of it were to be transferred to a feeding baby, researchers say it (and any lipid nanoparticles) would get broken down by the baby’s stomach acids.

3) Animal studies look promising. Before any shots were given to pregnant humans, vaccine companies gathered safety data in other pregnant mammals. None of these developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson suggest any safety concerns for use during pregnancy.

Rats, of course, are not humans, and DART study results do not always translate identically into humans. “Some results are similar to humans, and some are very different,“ Gaw says. Nevertheless, they are a good starting point — when combined with strong safety data in the clinical trials and public vaccinations so far.

4) We haven’t seen adverse events in pregnant people who have gotten it so far. For the Covid-19 vaccine trials, those of “childbearing potential” were screened for pregnancy before each shot, and those with positive tests were removed from the studies. However, a handful of people (12 who got the vaccine in Pfizer/BioNTech’s study and six who got the vaccine in Moderna’s study) ended up having been pregnant at the time of vaccination — and companies haven’t reported any negative outcomes from these individuals.

A newer and much larger data set is emerging from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is following pregnant people who sign up for its tracking platform V-safe after being vaccinated — and allowing them to sign up for a more targeted pregnancy-specific vaccine registry.

At the beginning of March, the CDC reported data from more than 1,800 pregnant people in the registry who had received Covid-19 vaccines. Among these individuals, there was not a statistically significant increase in adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Nor have they found any significant differences in side effects from the vaccine (such as fatigue or fever).

“From a scientific perspective, there’s no specific reason to think that pregnant individuals would have more adverse reactions to the vaccine or that there would be a risk to the fetus with the vaccine, while we know that there is risk with the Covid infection,” says Alisa Kachikis, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington.

A January study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, for example, analyzed the outcomes of more than 406,000 people who gave birth in hospitals between April and November 2020 and found that a significantly higher rate of those with Covid-19 had major complications. “The higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, thrombotic [blood clotting] events, and death in women giving birth with Covid-19 highlight the need for strategies to minimize risk,” noted the authors.

So why are some, such as the WHO and the UK, still saying most pregnant people should not get the coronavirus vaccine yet? They are waiting for more data.

There are also, of course, other types of coronavirus vaccines in the works, such as protein-based vaccines (which is the basis for Novavax’s shots). This model of shot has been used for years — including for pertussis and hepatitis B — “and we are very comfortable with [their] safety profile,” Gaw says. Viral vector vaccines (which is how the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford shots work) have also been used safely in pregnancy, such as for the Ebola and Zika vaccines, although there is less historical data on these.

So, says Kachikis, if what’s hanging people up about getting a Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy is mostly the novelty of the mRNA vaccines, having other types to choose from — as long as they’re just as effective — could be a good option.

What studies are happening, and what will they help us learn about the Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy?

The CDC continues to monitor for any adverse outcomes and side effects through its V-safe program — and related pregnancy registry (which will check in with participants in each trimester, after delivery, and when the baby is 3 months old).

Pfizer/BioNTech started giving vaccine doses in their pregnancy-focused, placebo-controlled clinical trial this February. They are first running a smaller safety study of just 350 healthy pregnant participants before scaling up to give the vaccine to a total of about 4,000 people who are at between 24 and 34 weeks gestation. (This study design, however, will still leave some questions about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, especially earlier in pregnancy.)

Moderna has created a registry that people can sign up for after receiving their vaccine while pregnant. For its part, Johnson & Johnson plans to conduct trials of its vaccine in pregnant participants later (likely after it studies the vaccine in children).

In the meantime, other researchers are racing to collect and study data from the natural experiment that started in December, when many pregnant people began electing to get vaccines as they became eligible because of their high-risk work in hospitals or long-term care centers.

At the University of Washington, Kachikis is leading a study to also follow vaccination in people who are pregnant. Thousands of people from around the US and the world who have received the vaccine while pregnant have already signed up for the registry, she says. (People who are pregnant or lactating but have not yet gotten vaccinated can also sign up, as can people who are considering becoming pregnant within the next two years.) This research will help them track any adverse outcomes, as well as gather additional data, such as whether any vaccinated individuals (or their newborns) later get Covid-19.

An additional large-scale clinical trial, which has not started enrolling participants, aims to track 5,000 women and their offspring over the course of 21 months. Other smaller studies are in the works as well, such as one at Duke University.

At UCSF, Gaw and her team are in the midst of separate observational studies. They will more closely follow a smaller group of participants — 100 or so of whom are pregnant and roughly 50 of whom are lactating — “to determine whether the Covid vaccines are equally effective in pregnant and lactating women, how long antibody responses last, and whether immunity is transferred to the baby,” Gaw explains.

Other vaccines are routinely given in pregnancy, such as pertussis, in large part to provide protective antibodies to the fetus and protect the newborn until they are old enough to get the vaccine themselves.

Covid-19 antibodies have been shown to transfer across the placenta in women who were positive for the virus at delivery. The new AJOG study found that even higher levels of antibodies were present in the umbilical cord after Covid-19 vaccination than after natural infection. “The research shows really promising results,” Kachikis says.

If these antibodies prove to be protective, it could be especially helpful, as newborns and infants will likely be among the last to have an authorized vaccine — and have the highest rates for complications and death from the virus among children. “There is still a lot of data that needs to be assessed, but for individuals who are thinking of ways that the vaccine may benefit their newborn, this is really encouraging,” Kachikis says.

More nuanced research might also eventually help advise on optimal timing for the Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy. For example, Gaw notes, “there needs to be sufficient time for the mom to develop a robust antibody response, and then pass [this] to the baby.” After extensive research, the Tdap vaccine is recommended around 27 weeks of gestation so as to provide the best protection for the infant after birth. Without such information for the Covid-19 vaccine, many experts are recommending that those who decide to get the shot treat it like the flu shot — getting it as soon as it’s available to them, regardless of where they are in their pregnancy.

People who are lactating were also excluded from the vaccine trials. So researchers at a number of institutions are now working to study how the vaccine might impact breast milk contents and a nursing child. A study from October 2020 showed that most people who had recovered from Covid-19, as well as those suspected of being infected, passed on antibodies to the virus in their breast milk.

The recently released AJOG paper found a high level of antibodies in breast milk from women who had received the Covid-19 vaccine. Gaw’s team also has new findings, which are currently in peer review, that show a solid dose of Covid-19 antibodies in breast milk samples after vaccination. This, they hope, will provide some protection from the virus for babies.

“It’s all reassuring,” Gaw says. But “all the studies have been small...[so] we can’t 100 percent determine safety until a lot more people have been vaccinated and it’s been reported on.”

Wait, why weren’t pregnant people included in the early research to begin with?

Pregnancy has, for decades, been considered a “vulnerable” condition when it comes to researching new medical treatments and preventions, meaning people who are pregnant have been excluded from general trials in much the same way as have those who are unable to give informed consent, like children and those with severe mental disabilities.

Part of the reason for this might be due to the damaging legacy of thalidomide. This drug was given to pregnant women around the world starting in the 1950s as a way to ease nausea (although it was never approved specifically for use in pregnancy in the US). Soon, thousands of these babies were being born with devastating birth defects. This hammered home for scientists and the public that, when it comes to pregnant women and their fetuses, much more care ought to be taken in giving medications or vaccines.

But this conclusion, many are now saying, has it backward, as the oft-repeated phrase indicates: Protect pregnant people “through research, not from research.” If thalidomide had been carefully and systematically studied for pregnancy, it likely never would have been approved for use (or used unofficially) in this population, preventing the majority of these tragic outcomes.

“It can’t be emphasized enough that pregnant women should be included in vaccine trials from the get-go,” Kachikis says.

Gaw agrees: “We actually cause harm by not including [pregnant people] in early research, as they have to wait longer for good data to be published.”

So when will we have more data about the coronavirus vaccine in pregnancy and lactation?

One big challenge with researching anything to do with pregnancy is that it takes a long time: nine months, plus follow-up time to monitor infant outcomes. And subsequent study during lactation while you’re at it, and maybe preconception research, too.

Consider that it took vaccine makers just 10 months to develop the Covid-19 vaccines and ensure they were safe and effective in adults. But with formal studies in pregnant people just getting underway (and with many having not yet started, and others, like Pfizer’s, currently limited to late pregnancy), it could be late 2021 or beyond until we have comprehensive, robust safety data for all stages of pregnancy. And even later to assess long-term outcomes for babies.

Follow-up to the early work Gaw and colleagues are doing at UCSF will take “at least six to nine months, as we have to wait for a sufficient number of babies to deliver,” Gaw says.

Kachikis and her team at the University of Washington plan to follow the outcomes of people who sign up for their list for about a year, with hopes to continue more long-term follow-up. For example, they plan to test babies months after birth to see how long antibodies from vaccines given during gestation persist — and if these antibodies are equally as effective at fighting off the coronavirus as those found in the vaccinated adults.

But they aren’t waiting that long to start sharing what they learn. “The focus is on getting any data out,” Kachikis says. And “if multiple groups can get some data out, that will be better than having absolutely nothing,” which has been the situation, she notes.

For now, much of the official guidance in the US stresses the need for people to conduct their own analysis of the known increased risks of Covid-19 in pregnancy with the remaining unknowns of the vaccine. And this calculus is not the same for everyone.

“As more evidence is coming out, it’s tilting to more benefit of getting the vaccine,” Gaw says. “But every individual has a different level of risk they’re willing to take” — as well as the amount of risk they might have of contracting the virus or getting extremely sick from it. The bottom line, based on the latest Covid-19 vaccine research in pregnancy, she says, is that “it’s looking more and more like it does work, it does pass antibodies to the baby (although we don’t know yet how protective they are), and there doesn’t look like there’s any harm at this moment.”

Additionally, even those who are reluctant to advocate the vaccine for all pregnant people just yet, such as the WHO, do suggest it should be available to those at high risk of exposure to the virus or underlying health conditions that increase their risk of severe Covid-19.

And some might elect to wait until there is more solid data. So to help move along the plodding process, people who are pregnant and have gotten the vaccine — or are considering it — can contribute to getting more and better guidance sooner by opting in to registries and studies.

2021-02-05 13:00:15+00:00,12,"America’s Covid-19 epidemic is still a disaster. The country is averaging more than 130,000 new cases a day, and deaths are still above 3,000 daily. The vaccine rollout isn’t going as smoothly as anyone would like, and most people still don’t know when they’ll be able to get a vaccine.

But for the first time while covering the pandemic, I’m feeling just a little more optimistic this week — for two big reasons.

First, the number of daily new Covid-19 cases in the US has plummeted dramatically in the past month by an astonishing 45 percent since early January.

Second, the pace of vaccinations has continued to climb steadily over the past few weeks, quadrupling the number of shots a day in a month’s time. The current pace is still not great or even good, but it’s a big step in the right direction.

There are caveats everywhere. The number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the US is still way too high; when controlling for population, the rates of both are still higher than that in most developed countries. The vaccine rollout is still going too slowly for the pandemic to end in the summer, as many of us want; the current pace puts us on track for reaching sufficient population protection as late as 2022. New virus variants from the UK, South Africa, and Brazil could lead to a spike in infections in the US, and offer a warning for possible future mutations.

“The post-holiday drop is good and so is the increasing vaccination rate,” Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, told me. “The concerning piece, though, is that we’re still seeing significant community transmission and a bit in the dark about how truly prevalent the new variants are.”

So things aren’t going great, but they’re getting better. In times filled with so much despair, it’s worth highlighting some of that progress.

1) Daily new Covid-19 cases have plummeted in the US

Here’s the first bit of good news: The surge of Covid-19 cases from the holiday season appears to be — finally — subsiding. According to Our World in Data, the US peaked at nearly 250,000 cases a day, based on a weekly rolling average, on January 8. Less than a month later, daily new cases are below 140,000 a day.

That amounts to a roughly 45 percent drop in just a few weeks.

This is likely a result of the country collectively responding to the holiday season surge, whether it’s new restrictions imposed by state and local governments over the past few months or the general public boosting adherence to precautions like masking and social distancing (especially now that Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve are over). Growing immunity to the virus, whether through getting sick or vaccinated, may be playing a role too.

By no stretch of the imagination should the drop in cases be taken to mean that the surge is completely over and the US can now relax. America’s reported caseload is still above what it was at any point in the pandemic before the fall. The death toll hasn’t come down much yet, likely because there’s a lag period between infection, serious illness, and death.

Any relaxation now, whether in government restrictions or public adherence, would likely result in another surge. There is still a lot of virus out there, ready to jump from person to person if given the opportunity. That’s especially true now as new, more infectious coronavirus variants await — putting us at risk of an even bigger surge than the one we saw during the holiday season if we ease up.

So maybe don’t host that big Super Bowl party this year.

2) The vaccine campaign is improving

The other bit of good news is America’s vaccine campaign has picked up pace and seems likely to continue doing so in the next few weeks and months.

At the start of January, the US was delivering around 300,000 shots a day. The country has since more than quadrupled that — with the US now above 1.3 million shots a day.

There’s good reason to think this will speed up in the coming weeks. President Joe Biden’s administration, state and local governments, and various parts of the medical system are working to ramp up production and distribution of vaccines. Upcoming vaccine candidates could also make the delivery and administration of vaccines easier and faster; for example, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which data suggests is effective, requires just one shot to administer, while the currently approved vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer each require two shots given weeks apart.

Still, there are some reasons to temper the optimism.

Perhaps most importantly, the current pace of vaccination means the country won’t reach sufficient population protection or herd immunity — estimated at 70 to 80 percent — until the fall, winter, or even 2022. And even that’s dependent on a vaccine getting approved for kids, which isn’t a sure thing yet. If vaccinations don’t pick up to 2 million or 3 million shots a day, the US won’t get that summer end to Covid-19 that many public officials have promised.

There’s also the question of whether vaccines stop transmission. Right now, the evidence shows vaccines prevent serious illness and death, but whether that translates to preventing the spread of the coronavirus is unknown. That doesn’t mean the vaccines don’t protect against transmission, it means it’s unclear whether they do or not. This could dictate just how good of a job the vaccines do at protecting the broader community above and beyond the person who gets the vaccine.

And we still don’t know how long the vaccines’ protection lasts. It could be months, years, or permanent. The situation is complicated by the rise of variants, which might eventually evolve to overcome a vaccine (though that doesn’t seem true for the current variants). Depending on the answer, the US may require regular vaccine campaigns against the coronavirus in the future, similar to the flu.

All of that is to say that there is still a lot of work to be done, both in administering shots and learning how effective the vaccines are, before the country can truly return to normal.

To put it another way: The fact we can now see some sort of finish line, between the drop in cases and vaccinations, makes it all the more important that the country sticks to masking, social distancing, and all the other recommended precautions against Covid-19 — to make sure more people can make it through that finish line alive and well.

But, if nothing else, at least the finish line seems a bit nearer now.

2021-02-05 12:01:29+00:00,47,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0
2021-02-04 18:39:56+00:00,3,"People who are pregnant are now eligible to get the coronavirus vaccine in more than 40 states — typically ahead of their lower-risk peers. And more than 60,000 of them have already rolled up their sleeves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Although the Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the US were not studied in pregnancy, early data is now starting to emerge suggesting — as researchers expected — that the vaccines are likely safe during pregnancy and confer protection not only to the recipient but also, potentially, the baby.

“It’s all very positive,” says Stephanie Gaw, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, of the findings so far.

There have been many reasons to suspect the vaccines should be safe in pregnancy, including the lack of major adverse events reported so far, solid studies in animals, and a good understanding of how the vaccines work in the body (they don’t contain live virus, and they are quickly broken down). “The data that we’re collecting on it so far has no red flags,” Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease doctor, said in February.

Second, in the USA more than 44,000 pregnant people have so far received an mRNA vaccine. Passive surveillance of these people has revealed no safety signal, and the same is true for active surveillance of 1,815 pregnant people through V-safe. 4/https://t.co/LrItWY3VOC pic.twitter.com/2YqHLUtKm8 — Viki Male (@VikiLovesFACS) March 15, 2021

Meanwhile, new research, published March 25 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that the vaccines offer strong immune protection for people who are pregnant, just like their non-pregnant peers.

Preliminary research also suggests vaccines might provide some protection to newborns, who are unlikely to have their own approved Covid-19 vaccine anytime soon (and are also vulnerable to more severe illness). The new AJOG paper joins other early findings that antibodies to Covid-19 generated by pregnant mothers after receiving their vaccines were passed through the placenta to the fetus.

But Covid-19 vaccine rollout to the pregnant population has been inconsistent around the globe.

For months, the US and many national medical groups — including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine — say the vaccine should be offered to this group, in large part because there’s strong evidence that pregnancy elevates the risk for severe Covid-19 and death. (Given this data, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine goes so far as to say the vaccine is “recommended” for those who are pregnant or considering pregnancy.)

“If a pregnant patient gets infected during pregnancy, her risk of intensive care admission is around 5 percent,” says David Baud, chief of obstetrics at Le Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois in Switzerland, where he studies infections during pregnancy. “I do not know of any disease that put a 30-year-old woman at such high risk to be admitted to the ICU.” Furthermore, if the infection happens late in pregnancy, it increases the risk of preterm birth and the baby needing intensive care.

Israel went as far as adding pregnant women to its vaccine priority list in January. But other countries, such as the UK and Germany, and the World Health Organization are still saying most people who are pregnant should wait.

Why the disagreement? The clinical trials of the new Covid-19 vaccines explicitly excluded pregnant people, and we don’t yet have enough follow-up data from individuals who have opted to get the shots to say for sure they are safe for everyone during pregnancy.

Add to this muddled landscape the persistent misinformation swirling around the Covid-19 vaccines and pregnancy and fertility, and it is little wonder some people are still confused or worried. And most organizations still stop short of advising all pregnant people to definitely get the vaccine.

Thankfully, these information gaps are starting to fill in. Numerous studies are underway following the outcomes of pregnant and breastfeeding people and their offspring after immunization. And a handful of them are now starting to report early, reassuring results.

In the meantime, however, a growing number of people have had to come to their own decision, with the optional help of their care provider, with some uncertainty. And no one needs an extra thing to stress about during a pandemic pregnancy.

So more information about the coronavirus vaccines in pregnancy can’t come soon enough.

4 reasons the coronavirus vaccine should be okay to get while pregnant — but why not everyone is recommending it yet

One of the big reasons why, despite Covid-19’s known risks in pregnancy, not everyone has unequivocally recommended the vaccines that currently have emergency approval in the US for pregnant people is that the way they work is fairly new. But we do have some key pieces of information already:

1) These vaccines don’t contain live coronavirus. The only types of vaccines that are contraindicated in pregnancy contain live virus that has been weakened, such as the chickenpox vaccine. (Even fewer immunizations, such as the smallpox vaccine, are not recommended during lactation.) While these vaccines don’t pose a risk to most people, there is a small, theoretical chance they could cross the placenta and infect the fetus.

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, on the other hand, contain just a fragment of genetic material, called messenger RNA, that can tell human cells to build a tiny part of the virus’s outer shell, which the immune system learns to recognize and fight off. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different method, known as a viral vector (the same platform as the already-used Zika and Ebola vaccines), to get the body to build part of the virus’s shell.

In either case, there is no way the vaccine can cause a Covid-19 infection.

2) The main coronavirus vaccines are very fragile. Once the mRNA enters the body, it likely only reaches local arm muscle cells before the body breaks it down. This means it is unlikely to enter the bloodstream, and even less likely to make it as far as the placenta. Even if it does get that far, “one of the placenta’s main functions is to be an immune barrier to the fetus,” which adds another layer of protection, says Gaw. And although it contains genetic material, it doesn’t enter our cells’ nuclei, meaning that it can’t cause any mutations to our cells — or those of a developing fetus. This mRNA is so fragile, vaccine developers had to wrap it in nanolipids (which are also presumed to be safe for pregnancy) just to keep it intact long enough to reach muscle cells in the arm.

Experts also expect it is unlikely for the mRNA to make its way intact into breast milk. Preliminary research from Gaw and her team, which is in the process of being peer-reviewed, found no trace of the vaccine itself in breast milk samples from hours and days post-vaccination. And even if a small amount of it were to be transferred to a feeding baby, researchers say it (and any lipid nanoparticles) would get broken down by the baby’s stomach acids.

3) Animal studies look promising. Before any shots were given to pregnant humans, vaccine companies gathered safety data in other pregnant mammals. None of these developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson suggest any safety concerns for use during pregnancy.

Rats, of course, are not humans, and DART study results do not always translate identically into humans. “Some results are similar to humans, and some are very different,“ Gaw says. Nevertheless, they are a good starting point — when combined with strong safety data in the clinical trials and public vaccinations so far.

4) We haven’t seen adverse events in pregnant people who have gotten it so far. For the Covid-19 vaccine trials, those of “childbearing potential” were screened for pregnancy before each shot, and those with positive tests were removed from the studies. However, a handful of people (12 who got the vaccine in Pfizer/BioNTech’s study and six who got the vaccine in Moderna’s study) ended up having been pregnant at the time of vaccination — and companies haven’t reported any negative outcomes from these individuals.

A newer and much larger data set is emerging from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is following pregnant people who sign up for its tracking platform V-safe after being vaccinated — and allowing them to sign up for a more targeted pregnancy-specific vaccine registry.

At the beginning of March, the CDC reported data from more than 1,800 pregnant people in the registry who had received Covid-19 vaccines. Among these individuals, there was not a statistically significant increase in adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Nor have they found any significant differences in side effects from the vaccine (such as fatigue or fever).

“From a scientific perspective, there’s no specific reason to think that pregnant individuals would have more adverse reactions to the vaccine or that there would be a risk to the fetus with the vaccine, while we know that there is risk with the Covid infection,” says Alisa Kachikis, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington.

A January study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, for example, analyzed the outcomes of more than 406,000 people who gave birth in hospitals between April and November 2020 and found that a significantly higher rate of those with Covid-19 had major complications. “The higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, thrombotic [blood clotting] events, and death in women giving birth with Covid-19 highlight the need for strategies to minimize risk,” noted the authors.

So why are some, such as the WHO and the UK, still saying most pregnant people should not get the coronavirus vaccine yet? They are waiting for more data.

There are also, of course, other types of coronavirus vaccines in the works, such as protein-based vaccines (which is the basis for Novavax’s shots). This model of shot has been used for years — including for pertussis and hepatitis B — “and we are very comfortable with [their] safety profile,” Gaw says. Viral vector vaccines (which is how the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford shots work) have also been used safely in pregnancy, such as for the Ebola and Zika vaccines, although there is less historical data on these.

So, says Kachikis, if what’s hanging people up about getting a Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy is mostly the novelty of the mRNA vaccines, having other types to choose from — as long as they’re just as effective — could be a good option.

What studies are happening, and what will they help us learn about the Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy?

The CDC continues to monitor for any adverse outcomes and side effects through its V-safe program — and related pregnancy registry (which will check in with participants in each trimester, after delivery, and when the baby is 3 months old).

Pfizer/BioNTech started giving vaccine doses in their pregnancy-focused, placebo-controlled clinical trial this February. They are first running a smaller safety study of just 350 healthy pregnant participants before scaling up to give the vaccine to a total of about 4,000 people who are at between 24 and 34 weeks gestation. (This study design, however, will still leave some questions about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, especially earlier in pregnancy.)

Moderna has created a registry that people can sign up for after receiving their vaccine while pregnant. For its part, Johnson & Johnson plans to conduct trials of its vaccine in pregnant participants later (likely after it studies the vaccine in children).

In the meantime, other researchers are racing to collect and study data from the natural experiment that started in December, when many pregnant people began electing to get vaccines as they became eligible because of their high-risk work in hospitals or long-term care centers.

At the University of Washington, Kachikis is leading a study to also follow vaccination in people who are pregnant. Thousands of people from around the US and the world who have received the vaccine while pregnant have already signed up for the registry, she says. (People who are pregnant or lactating but have not yet gotten vaccinated can also sign up, as can people who are considering becoming pregnant within the next two years.) This research will help them track any adverse outcomes, as well as gather additional data, such as whether any vaccinated individuals (or their newborns) later get Covid-19.

An additional large-scale clinical trial, which has not started enrolling participants, aims to track 5,000 women and their offspring over the course of 21 months. Other smaller studies are in the works as well, such as one at Duke University.

At UCSF, Gaw and her team are in the midst of separate observational studies. They will more closely follow a smaller group of participants — 100 or so of whom are pregnant and roughly 50 of whom are lactating — “to determine whether the Covid vaccines are equally effective in pregnant and lactating women, how long antibody responses last, and whether immunity is transferred to the baby,” Gaw explains.

Other vaccines are routinely given in pregnancy, such as pertussis, in large part to provide protective antibodies to the fetus and protect the newborn until they are old enough to get the vaccine themselves.

Covid-19 antibodies have been shown to transfer across the placenta in women who were positive for the virus at delivery. The new AJOG study found that even higher levels of antibodies were present in the umbilical cord after Covid-19 vaccination than after natural infection. “The research shows really promising results,” Kachikis says.

If these antibodies prove to be protective, it could be especially helpful, as newborns and infants will likely be among the last to have an authorized vaccine — and have the highest rates for complications and death from the virus among children. “There is still a lot of data that needs to be assessed, but for individuals who are thinking of ways that the vaccine may benefit their newborn, this is really encouraging,” Kachikis says.

More nuanced research might also eventually help advise on optimal timing for the Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy. For example, Gaw notes, “there needs to be sufficient time for the mom to develop a robust antibody response, and then pass [this] to the baby.” After extensive research, the Tdap vaccine is recommended around 27 weeks of gestation so as to provide the best protection for the infant after birth. Without such information for the Covid-19 vaccine, many experts are recommending that those who decide to get the shot treat it like the flu shot — getting it as soon as it’s available to them, regardless of where they are in their pregnancy.

People who are lactating were also excluded from the vaccine trials. So researchers at a number of institutions are now working to study how the vaccine might impact breast milk contents and a nursing child. A study from October 2020 showed that most people who had recovered from Covid-19, as well as those suspected of being infected, passed on antibodies to the virus in their breast milk.

The recently released AJOG paper found a high level of antibodies in breast milk from women who had received the Covid-19 vaccine. Gaw’s team also has new findings, which are currently in peer review, that show a solid dose of Covid-19 antibodies in breast milk samples after vaccination. This, they hope, will provide some protection from the virus for babies.

“It’s all reassuring,” Gaw says. But “all the studies have been small...[so] we can’t 100 percent determine safety until a lot more people have been vaccinated and it’s been reported on.”

Wait, why weren’t pregnant people included in the early research to begin with?

Pregnancy has, for decades, been considered a “vulnerable” condition when it comes to researching new medical treatments and preventions, meaning people who are pregnant have been excluded from general trials in much the same way as have those who are unable to give informed consent, like children and those with severe mental disabilities.

Part of the reason for this might be due to the damaging legacy of thalidomide. This drug was given to pregnant women around the world starting in the 1950s as a way to ease nausea (although it was never approved specifically for use in pregnancy in the US). Soon, thousands of these babies were being born with devastating birth defects. This hammered home for scientists and the public that, when it comes to pregnant women and their fetuses, much more care ought to be taken in giving medications or vaccines.

But this conclusion, many are now saying, has it backward, as the oft-repeated phrase indicates: Protect pregnant people “through research, not from research.” If thalidomide had been carefully and systematically studied for pregnancy, it likely never would have been approved for use (or used unofficially) in this population, preventing the majority of these tragic outcomes.

“It can’t be emphasized enough that pregnant women should be included in vaccine trials from the get-go,” Kachikis says.

Gaw agrees: “We actually cause harm by not including [pregnant people] in early research, as they have to wait longer for good data to be published.”

So when will we have more data about the coronavirus vaccine in pregnancy and lactation?

One big challenge with researching anything to do with pregnancy is that it takes a long time: nine months, plus follow-up time to monitor infant outcomes. And subsequent study during lactation while you’re at it, and maybe preconception research, too.

Consider that it took vaccine makers just 10 months to develop the Covid-19 vaccines and ensure they were safe and effective in adults. But with formal studies in pregnant people just getting underway (and with many having not yet started, and others, like Pfizer’s, currently limited to late pregnancy), it could be late 2021 or beyond until we have comprehensive, robust safety data for all stages of pregnancy. And even later to assess long-term outcomes for babies.

Follow-up to the early work Gaw and colleagues are doing at UCSF will take “at least six to nine months, as we have to wait for a sufficient number of babies to deliver,” Gaw says.

Kachikis and her team at the University of Washington plan to follow the outcomes of people who sign up for their list for about a year, with hopes to continue more long-term follow-up. For example, they plan to test babies months after birth to see how long antibodies from vaccines given during gestation persist — and if these antibodies are equally as effective at fighting off the coronavirus as those found in the vaccinated adults.

But they aren’t waiting that long to start sharing what they learn. “The focus is on getting any data out,” Kachikis says. And “if multiple groups can get some data out, that will be better than having absolutely nothing,” which has been the situation, she notes.

For now, much of the official guidance in the US stresses the need for people to conduct their own analysis of the known increased risks of Covid-19 in pregnancy with the remaining unknowns of the vaccine. And this calculus is not the same for everyone.

I got my first shot of COVID-19 vaccine 2 days ago! I wanted to share my story in case another pregnant woman stumbles across this and can benefit from it. (oh yeah, for those who know me, we're expecting!) pic.twitter.com/x6zrSZtxkz — Mieko Kikuchi-Conbere (@miekocakes) March 22, 2021

“As more evidence is coming out, it’s tilting to more benefit of getting the vaccine,” Gaw says. “But every individual has a different level of risk they’re willing to take” — as well as the amount of risk they might have of contracting the virus or getting extremely sick from it. The bottom line, based on the latest Covid-19 vaccine research in pregnancy, she says, is that “it’s looking more and more like it does work, it does pass antibodies to the baby (although we don’t know yet how protective they are), and there doesn’t look like there’s any harm at this moment.”

Additionally, even those who are reluctant to advocate the vaccine for all pregnant people just yet, such as the WHO, do suggest it should be available to those at high risk of exposure to the virus or underlying health conditions that increase their risk of severe Covid-19.

And some might elect to wait until there is more solid data. So to help move along the plodding process, people who are pregnant and have gotten the vaccine — or are considering it — can contribute to getting more and better guidance sooner by opting in to registries and studies.

2021-02-04 15:10:06+00:00,17,"Last year, presidential candidate Joe Biden campaigned on a bold climate plan that included cleaning up America’s electricity system by 2035 with a federal Clean Electricity Standard (CES). A national CES, which would require utilities increase their share of renewable and carbon pollution-free electricity, is an old idea. But the ambition — 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 — was new.

By the end of the campaign, whenever he brought up climate change, which he did constantly, Biden had one year on his mind: 2035.

The new deadline reflects the scientific facts and the economic opportunity. The US must cut emissions by about half this decade to give the world a shot at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Doing this will create millions of good-paying jobs in the American clean energy economy. But to make progress at the pace and scale that’s necessary, it’s Congress who must focus on building a 100 percent clean electricity system.

That’s why we released a major report Thursday, with Evergreen Action and Data for Progress, which shows how Congress can get this done. As two policy experts and advocates who have focused on cleaning up the electricity sector, we think we have the best shot yet to get this policy passed this year.

Clean electricity is the backbone of the energy transition — the critical piece that all the other sectors will slot into. Not only will getting to 100 percent clean electricity directly cut more than a quarter of US carbon pollution, it will also enable large parts of our transportation, building, and industrial sectors to run on clean power. Powering as much of these sectors as we can with carbon-free electricity would allow us to cut US emissions 70 to 80 percent. It would, in short, solve a huge chunk of our climate challenge.

The climate demands it. The president campaigned on it. And 81 million Americans voted for it. It’s now time for Congress and the administration to deliver. Here’s how they can do it.

A proven, practical, and popular approach

Over the past three decades, 30 states — red and blue alike — have passed laws requiring electric utilities to use more clean energy. Since 2015, 10 states have adopted 100 percent clean electricity standards, requiring the transition to fully 100 percent carbon-free power. And six more have committed to that goal. State laws are popping up so fast, it’s hard to keep track. Across the country, 170 cities have policies to get to 100 percent clean. As a result, more than one in three Americans already live in a place that’s committed to reaching 100 percent clean power.

We know this approach is technologically possible. Wind, solar, batteries, transmission lines, and other technologies can replace dirty fossil fuels. Google, one of the largest electricity consumers in the country, is aiming for 100 percent clean power, real-time at all its facilities by 2030.

With all this state and local leadership, it’s not surprising that this approach is popular with the public. In independent polls from both Data for Progress and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, run over the past few months, more than two-thirds of voters support the federal government moving the country to 100 percent clean power by 2035.

And once we implement this policy nationally, it should stay popular because clean energy saves customers money.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, GridLab, and Energy Innovation have shown that we could dramatically clean up our electricity system by 2035 and lower electricity bills. Why? Many utilities continue to operate old, uneconomic coal plants. In just three years, these plants cost customers an additional $3.5 billion to keep open — and that’s before we add in all the extra hospital bills for folks breathing in their pollution day after day. Or the cost of destabilizing our climate. Replacing these dirty plants with clean power is not only good for our health; it’s also good for our wallets.

Clean electricity standards are proven, practical, and popular. What’s missing is federal policy, to ensure that every state and utility is switching from dirty energy to clean sources at the accelerated pace that’s necessary. Without a national CES, we know that utilities will not move fast enough — their own plans show that they won’t. This policy must be at the top of Congress’s to-do list this year.

How Congress can pass a CES through the budget reconciliation process

With the election last month in Georgia, Democrats took control of the Senate. However, their majority is slim. The Democrats and Republicans each have 50 seats, and Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tiebreaking votes in Democrats’ favor.

To pass meaningful legislation, Democrats have two options. They can get rid of the filibuster, an arcane Senate rule that prevents consideration of a bill without 60 votes. Or they must rely on a unique parliamentary process known as budget reconciliation, which allows some bills to pass with a simple majority.

Most voters think Congress should ditch the filibuster, and we certainly agree with them. But so far, some moderate Senate Democrats have expressed reluctance to do that. That means, at least for the time being, we’re talking a lot about option B.

Reconciliation is complicated. Essentially, it’s a legislative process that allows Congress to expedite bills that relate to federal government revenues (like taxes), outlays (spending), or the debt limit. This process allows legislation to pass with a simple majority in the Senate — just 51 votes. However, there are limits to what types of legislation can be included in this process. The criteria are written in the “Byrd Rule.” And this can’t be done all the time; historically, Congress has only used budget reconciliation once each fiscal year.

In our research for our report, we spent months talking with congressional offices, parliamentary experts, think tanks, climate advocates, and others, and have concluded that it is possible to pass a CES through the budget reconciliation process. In our report, we identify several ways a CES can fit with the Byrd Rule.

Most state clean energy laws create a system of credits that utilities and other power producers can get by producing clean power. These “zero-emissions electricity credits” — or ZECs — allow us to measure progress. Through reconciliation, the federal government could create a system of ZECs that live “on the books,” inside the federal budget. Utilities would earn ZECs by continuously increasing the amount of carbon-free electricity they deliver to customers, or else purchase the credits from the federal program.

Another approach would involve the federal government regularly buying a quantity of ZECs from power companies, through auctions. Essentially, companies would submit bids for how much they would like to be paid for the clean power they are producing. The federal government would set the quantity needed that year — for example, 80 percent clean power by 2030 — and purchase ZECs until that target was fulfilled. This approach would keep the costs of the policy low. Auctions have been used successfully in New York state.

A third approach could involve a twist on either of the first two, but with utilities earning clean energy credits for every ton of carbon pollution that they reduce, rather than for every megawatt-hour of clean electricity that they deliver. This is similar to policy recently adopted in Arizona’s new 100 percent clean electricity standard.

There are other alternatives that come close to approximating a federal CES and could also fit within the Byrd Rule. The federal government could provide funding to states with strings attached to ensure they are adopting carbon-free electricity requirements with the ambitious timelines necessary. Another option is a carbon-intensity standard that penalizes power utilities for failing to reduce their emissions. We could also continue to use the tax code to penalize and incentivize utilities, pushing them toward 100 percent clean electricity by 2035.

Each of these approaches can put us on a path to 100 percent clean electricity, even under the constraints of the Byrd Rule. We are confident there are other CES designs that could fit within reconciliation.

On the road to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, we need to hit 80 percent clean in 2030. This is a critical target for several reasons. It places the emphasis where it should be: on urgent and immediate progress. And it’s doable with the technology we have now.

Some utilities are already aiming for 80 percent clean by 2030, including practically all the ones in Colorado. These utilities, and others, recognize that it’s time to move off of fossil fuels. NIPSCO, in Indiana, has committed to retiring all its coal by 2028 and will not build new gas.

Focusing on 80 percent clean will ensure that we are not distracted by how to squeeze the last, and most difficult, 10 to 20 percent of pollution out of the electricity system. This target is also important because of congressional rules — the budget reconciliation process typically limits a law’s budgetary impact to 10 years. For all these reasons, a federal CES must include this 2030 target.

Congress and the Biden administration must pass other policies alongside a CES, to drive environmental justice and equitable economic opportunity, and promote good union jobs. We outline a number of them in our report, including long-term federal clean energy investments through tax incentives, grants, and public financing; energy transition support through debt retirement for coal plants and financial resources for fossil fuel communities; speeding up electrification of other sectors, including vehicles and buildings; streamlining clean energy siting and permitting; promoting electricity market competition; intervenor compensation to ensure transition costs remain as low as possible; and policies to address the technology innovation gap.

Realistically, Congress will first tackle Covid-19 relief using budget reconciliation, and only turn to Biden’s clean infrastructure agenda in the months to come, during a second budget reconciliation process. Because Congress didn’t pass a budget resolution last year, there are two opportunities to use reconciliation this year.

The Biden administration cannot wait for Congress to act. In the meantime, it must use existing laws to begin making progress toward 100 percent clean electricity right away. Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency already has a clear legal requirement to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, because these pollutants endanger Americans’ health and well-being. It must also act on other dangerous pollution from fossil fuel power plants, advancing regulations that the Trump administration sat on, and reversing rollbacks made over the past four years.

Clean electricity is the way forward

President Biden and Vice President Harris ran and won on a bold plan for climate action.

As the country faces a terrible economic crisis, and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, a clean energy recovery is our best opportunity for economic recovery. A CES can create millions of good jobs and drive environmental justice. With a big push on clean power, we could see a net increase of 500,000 to 1 million more good-paying jobs in the energy sector this decade, reaching 2.2 million in the 2030s. If we worked on energy efficiency at the same time, we could get twice as many jobs.

Imagine what it will feel like in 2035, looking back on this moment 15 years from now. If we act now, all of us — everyday people, utility executives, and senators alike — can reflect on this moment and know that when we were called to act, we answered. Solving the climate crisis is possible, if only we are brave enough to see it, if only we are brave enough to do it.

2021-02-04 01:40:22+00:00,9,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-02-03 21:30:24+00:00,12,"In a 50-49 party-line vote on Tuesday, Senate Democrats took a key step in setting up a contingency plan for Covid-19 relief, voting to begin work on a stimulus package passable without any buy-in from Republicans.

While it’s still possible there could be a bipartisan deal on a Covid-19 package, disagreement between the two parties on just how big a relief package should be has prompted Democrats to keep their options open. During the Tuesday vote, Democrats voted unanimously to begin debate on a budget resolution, the first step in kicking off the reconciliation process, which allows standard Senate procedure for most bills to be circumvented.

While Democrats would ordinarily need 60 votes to pass legislation, reconciliation would enable them to pass Covid-19 relief with a simple majority, or 51 votes. Even Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), long viewed as a key moderate swing vote and as someone hesitant to exclude Republicans from stimulus negotiations, was on board — an important sign that Democrats could have all the votes they need to approve more aid unilaterally.

“I will vote to move forward with the budget process because we must address the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis,” Manchin said in a statement explaining his decision, while noting that he favors a response narrowly targeted to the public health crisis. “I will only support proposals that will get us through and end the pain of this pandemic.”

The Tuesday vote has since triggered 50 hours of debate over the budget resolution, which will effectively serve as a blueprint for the final stimulus package. The resolution instructs Senate committees to write a budget bill that includes provisions of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief plan, including $1,400 direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment support, and expansions in food aid.

Since reconciliation is meant to be used only for tax- and spending-related measures, the ultimate budget bill is somewhat limited to Biden’s priorities that address these areas: There have been questions about whether an increase to the minimum wage could pass in this way, for example. And by taking this route, Democrats are signaling that they’re ready to go it alone if Republicans don’t back expansive relief.

“The work must move forward, preferably with our Republican colleagues, but without them, if we must,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has previously said.

What happens next

After the Senate wraps up 50 hours of debate on the budget resolution, lawmakers will finish considering amendments, and then get to work writing the reconciliation bill:

Every senator is able to file amendments, some of which will get voted on during a “vote-a-rama”: Senators are able to introduce budget-related amendments to the resolution, each of which will require 51 votes to pass. These amendments are voted on during a process known as a “vote-a-rama,” which will include back-to-back floor votes until lawmakers have considered all the amendments. This can take a while: Previous vote-a-ramas have gone until the early hours of the morning because of how many amendments there are.

Since Democrats have House and Senate control, the lower chamber is poised to approve the final version that the Senate passes.

The resolution directs 11 Senate committees to write the bill, and to ensure that it includes the provisions of Biden’s Covid-19 package. The Senate then votes on the final bill: This final budget bill can pass with just 51 votes as well, giving Democrats the opportunity to pass it unilaterally.

Budget reconciliation enables Democrats to advance relief on their own

A group of Senate Republicans has offered a counterproposal for Covid-19 relief, but it includes less than a third of the aid that Biden’s $1.9 trillion proposal contains. Democrats have argued that the GOP proposal is too small; after meeting with Biden on Wednesday, Schumer said, “There’s agreement, universal agreement, we must go big and bold.”

Although it’s possible GOP lawmakers could be willing to make some concessions, the distance between the two plans suggests that Democrats may have to move forward without any Republican support should they want to “go big.”

Budget reconciliation would allow them to pass legislation without needing to make a lot of compromises on Biden’s proposal — so long as their caucus remains unified. With just 51 votes needed to pass reconciliation instead of the standard 60 votes needed for most bills, the 50-member Democratic caucus will need to stay united, allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to serve as a tiebreaker and the 51st vote in the event that all Republicans vote against the final bill.

Both parties have used budget reconciliation to advance their own priorities in the past, with Senate Republicans capitalizing on the process to pass massive tax cuts in 2017. As Schumer has noted, the process has also been used with bipartisan support 17 times since 1980, including to advance the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

With debate now underway — and the need for more aid remaining pressing, given the housing and unemployment crises — Democrats appear ready to move forward on coronavirus relief even if Republicans don’t sign on.",voxdotcom,"['resolution', 'bill', 'amendments', 'senate', 'votes', 'pass', 'covid19', 'process', 'begun', 'vote', 'democrats', 'budget', 'relief', 'reconciliation']",0
2021-02-03 20:00:12+00:00,7,"The Biden White House and Democrats are considering whether the direct cash payments expected to be part of their Covid-19 relief legislation should be more narrowly targeted to the people most in need.

They should ask the same question about the relief bill’s plan to expand health coverage.

No legislative text has been written yet. But the Biden team did release a fairly detailed outline of what their $1.9 trillion Covid-19 package would look like, which Democrats in Congress are treating as the model for their bill. It included a proposal to expand the federal subsidies that people get to purchase private coverage on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces.

Currently, under the ACA, anybody can purchase insurance on the exchanges, but those with an income below 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $51,520 for an individual or $106,000 for a family of four) get additional federal help. Assistance isn’t available for households earning more. The Biden plan specifies that the president wants to extend eligibility for that assistance to all Americans — although it leaves some key details unaddressed — to ensure that nobody would pay more than 8.5 percent of their income for health coverage. That change would most help people in the middle class who make a little too much money to qualify for assistance under current law.

Under current law, a person or family whose income is barely above 400 percent of the poverty level will pay about 15 percent of their annual earnings on health insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). So the Biden proposal would cut their premiums significantly, making health insurance more affordable and likely leading to millions of people gaining coverage.

But while the middle class gets more government support, people in poverty are left out. The problem is Medicaid expansion.

The ACA was written to cover people in or near poverty in every state through Medicaid, with the federal government providing most of the funding to cover the cost. But Republican-led states sued in 2012 to challenge that provision, arguing that the federal government could not force states to expand their Medicaid eligibility. The Supreme Court agreed and, while most states have since accepted the expansion, 12 have not.

Those states have left about 2.2 million people living in poverty uninsured, according to estimates from KFF. People with incomes below the federal poverty level ($12,900 for one person, $26,500 for a family of four) are ineligible for subsidies to buy private insurance under the ACA because they were supposed to be getting Medicaid. Without the Medicaid expansion, they have no realistic option to afford a health plan.

“The most vulnerable group among the uninsured are people who have incomes below poverty but have no health coverage options whatsoever because their states have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me.

In other words, the wonky structure of the ACA combined with the Supreme Court’s decision have locked millions of Americans in poverty out of health coverage. And to make matters worse, there isn’t necessarily an easy solution.

Biden proposed creating a new government health insurance plan, a public option, that would automatically enroll people in the so-called Medicaid expansion gap. But Biden didn’t include a public option in his Covid-19 relief proposal, and it may be difficult to create one under the “budget reconciliation” process that will allow the Senate to advance the relief legislation with only Democratic votes.

There are other possibilities, according to Levitt. Congress could guarantee the federal government would permanently cover 100 percent of the expansion’s costs, as a way to encourage holdout states to come around. Or they could make people in poverty eligible for the ACA’s assistance to buy private insurance.

But in either case, Democrats would run into the problem of how to keep things equitable for states that have already expanded Medicaid.

In the first scenario, the expansion states might want additional federal funding, too, because they are currently covering 10 percent of the expansion’s costs. In the second scenario, the risk is that states would have a strong incentive to roll back their Medicaid expansion now that the people in poverty would be eligible for subsidies to purchase a private plan. A requirement that states must maintain their Medicaid expansion might not hold up in court if a state were to challenge it.

“The tricky part is getting coverage to poor people in the Medicaid coverage gap without creating incentives for states that have already expanded Medicaid to drop the expansion,” Levitt said.

This is a problem Democrats working on the Covid-19 relief plan are aware of — and they recognize it will be difficult to solve. Narrowly appropriating money to cover Covid-19 care for those people and increasing federal Medicaid funding to make sure states don’t cut benefits during a public health emergency may be more feasible options in the short term. Democrats could still try to tackle the Medicaid expansion gap in later legislation, too.

But it remains to be seen whether the Biden White House and the Democratic majorities, given the opportunity to patch up this hole in the ACA, can actually deliver health coverage to the Americans most in need.",voxdotcom,"['plan', 'federal', 'biden', 'covid19', 'medicaid', 'health', 'coverage', 'problem', 'bidens', 'aca', 'states', 'poverty', 'relief', 'expansion']",0
2021-02-03 19:30:04+00:00,8,"People who are pregnant are now eligible to get the coronavirus vaccine in more than 40 states — typically ahead of their lower-risk peers. And more than 60,000 of them have already rolled up their sleeves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Although the Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the US were not studied in pregnancy, early data is now starting to emerge suggesting — as researchers expected — that the vaccines are likely safe during pregnancy and confer protection not only to the recipient but also, potentially, the baby.

“It’s all very positive,” says Stephanie Gaw, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, of the findings so far.

There have been many reasons to suspect the vaccines should be safe in pregnancy, including the lack of major adverse events reported so far, solid studies in animals, and a good understanding of how the vaccines work in the body (they don’t contain live virus, and they are quickly broken down). “The data that we’re collecting on it so far has no red flags,” Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease doctor, said in February.

Second, in the USA more than 44,000 pregnant people have so far received an mRNA vaccine. Passive surveillance of these people has revealed no safety signal, and the same is true for active surveillance of 1,815 pregnant people through V-safe. 4/https://t.co/LrItWY3VOC pic.twitter.com/2YqHLUtKm8 — Viki Male (@VikiLovesFACS) March 15, 2021

Meanwhile, new research, published March 25 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that the vaccines offer strong immune protection for people who are pregnant, just like their non-pregnant peers.

Preliminary research also suggests vaccines might provide some protection to newborns, who are unlikely to have their own approved Covid-19 vaccine anytime soon (and are also vulnerable to more severe illness). The new AJOG paper joins other early findings that antibodies to Covid-19 generated by pregnant mothers after receiving their vaccines were passed through the placenta to the fetus.

But Covid-19 vaccine rollout to the pregnant population has been inconsistent around the globe.

For months, the US and many national medical groups — including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine — say the vaccine should be offered to this group, in large part because there’s strong evidence that pregnancy elevates the risk for severe Covid-19 and death. (Given this data, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine goes so far as to say the vaccine is “recommended” for those who are pregnant or considering pregnancy.)

“If a pregnant patient gets infected during pregnancy, her risk of intensive care admission is around 5 percent,” says David Baud, chief of obstetrics at Le Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois in Switzerland, where he studies infections during pregnancy. “I do not know of any disease that put a 30-year-old woman at such high risk to be admitted to the ICU.” Furthermore, if the infection happens late in pregnancy, it increases the risk of preterm birth and the baby needing intensive care.

Israel went as far as adding pregnant women to its vaccine priority list in January. But other countries, such as the UK and Germany, and the World Health Organization are still saying most people who are pregnant should wait.

Why the disagreement? The clinical trials of the new Covid-19 vaccines explicitly excluded pregnant people, and we don’t yet have enough follow-up data from individuals who have opted to get the shots to say for sure they are safe for everyone during pregnancy.

Add to this muddled landscape the persistent misinformation swirling around the Covid-19 vaccines and pregnancy and fertility, and it is little wonder some people are still confused or worried. And most organizations still stop short of advising all pregnant people to definitely get the vaccine.

Thankfully, these information gaps are starting to fill in. Numerous studies are underway following the outcomes of pregnant and breastfeeding people and their offspring after immunization. And a handful of them are now starting to report early, reassuring results.

In the meantime, however, a growing number of people have had to come to their own decision, with the optional help of their care provider, with some uncertainty. And no one needs an extra thing to stress about during a pandemic pregnancy.

So more information about the coronavirus vaccines in pregnancy can’t come soon enough.

4 reasons the coronavirus vaccine should be okay to get while pregnant — but why not everyone is recommending it yet

One of the big reasons why, despite Covid-19’s known risks in pregnancy, not everyone has unequivocally recommended the vaccines that currently have emergency approval in the US for pregnant people is that the way they work is fairly new. But we do have some key pieces of information already:

1) These vaccines don’t contain live coronavirus. The only types of vaccines that are contraindicated in pregnancy contain live virus that has been weakened, such as the chickenpox vaccine. (Even fewer immunizations, such as the smallpox vaccine, are not recommended during lactation.) While these vaccines don’t pose a risk to most people, there is a small, theoretical chance they could cross the placenta and infect the fetus.

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, on the other hand, contain just a fragment of genetic material, called messenger RNA, that can tell human cells to build a tiny part of the virus’s outer shell, which the immune system learns to recognize and fight off. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different method, known as a viral vector (the same platform as the already-used Zika and Ebola vaccines), to get the body to build part of the virus’s shell.

In either case, there is no way the vaccine can cause a Covid-19 infection.

2) The main coronavirus vaccines are very fragile. Once the mRNA enters the body, it likely only reaches local arm muscle cells before the body breaks it down. This means it is unlikely to enter the bloodstream, and even less likely to make it as far as the placenta. Even if it does get that far, “one of the placenta’s main functions is to be an immune barrier to the fetus,” which adds another layer of protection, says Gaw. And although it contains genetic material, it doesn’t enter our cells’ nuclei, meaning that it can’t cause any mutations to our cells — or those of a developing fetus. This mRNA is so fragile, vaccine developers had to wrap it in nanolipids (which are also presumed to be safe for pregnancy) just to keep it intact long enough to reach muscle cells in the arm.

Experts also expect it is unlikely for the mRNA to make its way intact into breast milk. Preliminary research from Gaw and her team, which is in the process of being peer-reviewed, found no trace of the vaccine itself in breast milk samples from hours and days post-vaccination. And even if a small amount of it were to be transferred to a feeding baby, researchers say it (and any lipid nanoparticles) would get broken down by the baby’s stomach acids.

3) Animal studies look promising. Before any shots were given to pregnant humans, vaccine companies gathered safety data in other pregnant mammals. None of these developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson suggest any safety concerns for use during pregnancy.

Rats, of course, are not humans, and DART study results do not always translate identically into humans. “Some results are similar to humans, and some are very different,“ Gaw says. Nevertheless, they are a good starting point — when combined with strong safety data in the clinical trials and public vaccinations so far.

4) We haven’t seen adverse events in pregnant people who have gotten it so far. For the Covid-19 vaccine trials, those of “childbearing potential” were screened for pregnancy before each shot, and those with positive tests were removed from the studies. However, a handful of people (12 who got the vaccine in Pfizer/BioNTech’s study and six who got the vaccine in Moderna’s study) ended up having been pregnant at the time of vaccination — and companies haven’t reported any negative outcomes from these individuals.

A newer and much larger data set is emerging from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is following pregnant people who sign up for its tracking platform V-safe after being vaccinated — and allowing them to sign up for a more targeted pregnancy-specific vaccine registry.

At the beginning of March, the CDC reported data from more than 1,800 pregnant people in the registry who had received Covid-19 vaccines. Among these individuals, there was not a statistically significant increase in adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Nor have they found any significant differences in side effects from the vaccine (such as fatigue or fever).

“From a scientific perspective, there’s no specific reason to think that pregnant individuals would have more adverse reactions to the vaccine or that there would be a risk to the fetus with the vaccine, while we know that there is risk with the Covid infection,” says Alisa Kachikis, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington.

A January study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, for example, analyzed the outcomes of more than 406,000 people who gave birth in hospitals between April and November 2020 and found that a significantly higher rate of those with Covid-19 had major complications. “The higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, thrombotic [blood clotting] events, and death in women giving birth with Covid-19 highlight the need for strategies to minimize risk,” noted the authors.

So why are some, such as the WHO and the UK, still saying most pregnant people should not get the coronavirus vaccine yet? They are waiting for more data.

There are also, of course, other types of coronavirus vaccines in the works, such as protein-based vaccines (which is the basis for Novavax’s shots). This model of shot has been used for years — including for pertussis and hepatitis B — “and we are very comfortable with [their] safety profile,” Gaw says. Viral vector vaccines (which is how the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford shots work) have also been used safely in pregnancy, such as for the Ebola and Zika vaccines, although there is less historical data on these.

So, says Kachikis, if what’s hanging people up about getting a Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy is mostly the novelty of the mRNA vaccines, having other types to choose from — as long as they’re just as effective — could be a good option.

What studies are happening, and what will they help us learn about the Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy?

The CDC continues to monitor for any adverse outcomes and side effects through its V-safe program — and related pregnancy registry (which will check in with participants in each trimester, after delivery, and when the baby is 3 months old).

Pfizer/BioNTech started giving vaccine doses in their pregnancy-focused, placebo-controlled clinical trial this February. They are first running a smaller safety study of just 350 healthy pregnant participants before scaling up to give the vaccine to a total of about 4,000 people who are at between 24 and 34 weeks gestation. (This study design, however, will still leave some questions about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, especially earlier in pregnancy.)

Moderna has created a registry that people can sign up for after receiving their vaccine while pregnant. For its part, Johnson & Johnson plans to conduct trials of its vaccine in pregnant participants later (likely after it studies the vaccine in children).

In the meantime, other researchers are racing to collect and study data from the natural experiment that started in December, when many pregnant people began electing to get vaccines as they became eligible because of their high-risk work in hospitals or long-term care centers.

At the University of Washington, Kachikis is leading a study to also follow vaccination in people who are pregnant. Thousands of people from around the US and the world who have received the vaccine while pregnant have already signed up for the registry, she says. (People who are pregnant or lactating but have not yet gotten vaccinated can also sign up, as can people who are considering becoming pregnant within the next two years.) This research will help them track any adverse outcomes, as well as gather additional data, such as whether any vaccinated individuals (or their newborns) later get Covid-19.

An additional large-scale clinical trial, which has not started enrolling participants, aims to track 5,000 women and their offspring over the course of 21 months. Other smaller studies are in the works as well, such as one at Duke University.

At UCSF, Gaw and her team are in the midst of separate observational studies. They will more closely follow a smaller group of participants — 100 or so of whom are pregnant and roughly 50 of whom are lactating — “to determine whether the Covid vaccines are equally effective in pregnant and lactating women, how long antibody responses last, and whether immunity is transferred to the baby,” Gaw explains.

Other vaccines are routinely given in pregnancy, such as pertussis, in large part to provide protective antibodies to the fetus and protect the newborn until they are old enough to get the vaccine themselves.

Covid-19 antibodies have been shown to transfer across the placenta in women who were positive for the virus at delivery. The new AJOG study found that even higher levels of antibodies were present in the umbilical cord after Covid-19 vaccination than after natural infection. “The research shows really promising results,” Kachikis says.

If these antibodies prove to be protective, it could be especially helpful, as newborns and infants will likely be among the last to have an authorized vaccine — and have the highest rates for complications and death from the virus among children. “There is still a lot of data that needs to be assessed, but for individuals who are thinking of ways that the vaccine may benefit their newborn, this is really encouraging,” Kachikis says.

More nuanced research might also eventually help advise on optimal timing for the Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy. For example, Gaw notes, “there needs to be sufficient time for the mom to develop a robust antibody response, and then pass [this] to the baby.” After extensive research, the Tdap vaccine is recommended around 27 weeks of gestation so as to provide the best protection for the infant after birth. Without such information for the Covid-19 vaccine, many experts are recommending that those who decide to get the shot treat it like the flu shot — getting it as soon as it’s available to them, regardless of where they are in their pregnancy.

People who are lactating were also excluded from the vaccine trials. So researchers at a number of institutions are now working to study how the vaccine might impact breast milk contents and a nursing child. A study from October 2020 showed that most people who had recovered from Covid-19, as well as those suspected of being infected, passed on antibodies to the virus in their breast milk.

The recently released AJOG paper found a high level of antibodies in breast milk from women who had received the Covid-19 vaccine. Gaw’s team also has new findings, which are currently in peer review, that show a solid dose of Covid-19 antibodies in breast milk samples after vaccination. This, they hope, will provide some protection from the virus for babies.

“It’s all reassuring,” Gaw says. But “all the studies have been small...[so] we can’t 100 percent determine safety until a lot more people have been vaccinated and it’s been reported on.”

Wait, why weren’t pregnant people included in the early research to begin with?

Pregnancy has, for decades, been considered a “vulnerable” condition when it comes to researching new medical treatments and preventions, meaning people who are pregnant have been excluded from general trials in much the same way as have those who are unable to give informed consent, like children and those with severe mental disabilities.

Part of the reason for this might be due to the damaging legacy of thalidomide. This drug was given to pregnant women around the world starting in the 1950s as a way to ease nausea (although it was never approved specifically for use in pregnancy in the US). Soon, thousands of these babies were being born with devastating birth defects. This hammered home for scientists and the public that, when it comes to pregnant women and their fetuses, much more care ought to be taken in giving medications or vaccines.

But this conclusion, many are now saying, has it backward, as the oft-repeated phrase indicates: Protect pregnant people “through research, not from research.” If thalidomide had been carefully and systematically studied for pregnancy, it likely never would have been approved for use (or used unofficially) in this population, preventing the majority of these tragic outcomes.

“It can’t be emphasized enough that pregnant women should be included in vaccine trials from the get-go,” Kachikis says.

Gaw agrees: “We actually cause harm by not including [pregnant people] in early research, as they have to wait longer for good data to be published.”

So when will we have more data about the coronavirus vaccine in pregnancy and lactation?

One big challenge with researching anything to do with pregnancy is that it takes a long time: nine months, plus follow-up time to monitor infant outcomes. And subsequent study during lactation while you’re at it, and maybe preconception research, too.

Consider that it took vaccine makers just 10 months to develop the Covid-19 vaccines and ensure they were safe and effective in adults. But with formal studies in pregnant people just getting underway (and with many having not yet started, and others, like Pfizer’s, currently limited to late pregnancy), it could be late 2021 or beyond until we have comprehensive, robust safety data for all stages of pregnancy. And even later to assess long-term outcomes for babies.

Follow-up to the early work Gaw and colleagues are doing at UCSF will take “at least six to nine months, as we have to wait for a sufficient number of babies to deliver,” Gaw says.

Kachikis and her team at the University of Washington plan to follow the outcomes of people who sign up for their list for about a year, with hopes to continue more long-term follow-up. For example, they plan to test babies months after birth to see how long antibodies from vaccines given during gestation persist — and if these antibodies are equally as effective at fighting off the coronavirus as those found in the vaccinated adults.

But they aren’t waiting that long to start sharing what they learn. “The focus is on getting any data out,” Kachikis says. And “if multiple groups can get some data out, that will be better than having absolutely nothing,” which has been the situation, she notes.

For now, much of the official guidance in the US stresses the need for people to conduct their own analysis of the known increased risks of Covid-19 in pregnancy with the remaining unknowns of the vaccine. And this calculus is not the same for everyone.

I got my first shot of COVID-19 vaccine 2 days ago! I wanted to share my story in case another pregnant woman stumbles across this and can benefit from it. (oh yeah, for those who know me, we're expecting!) pic.twitter.com/x6zrSZtxkz — Mieko Kikuchi-Conbere (@miekocakes) March 22, 2021

“As more evidence is coming out, it’s tilting to more benefit of getting the vaccine,” Gaw says. “But every individual has a different level of risk they’re willing to take” — as well as the amount of risk they might have of contracting the virus or getting extremely sick from it. The bottom line, based on the latest Covid-19 vaccine research in pregnancy, she says, is that “it’s looking more and more like it does work, it does pass antibodies to the baby (although we don’t know yet how protective they are), and there doesn’t look like there’s any harm at this moment.”

Additionally, even those who are reluctant to advocate the vaccine for all pregnant people just yet, such as the WHO, do suggest it should be available to those at high risk of exposure to the virus or underlying health conditions that increase their risk of severe Covid-19.

And some might elect to wait until there is more solid data. So to help move along the plodding process, people who are pregnant and have gotten the vaccine — or are considering it — can contribute to getting more and better guidance sooner by opting in to registries and studies.

Share All sharing options for: Covid-19 vaccines are great — here’s why you also still need to wear a mask for now

After months of exhausting isolation, widespread economic pain, and an extraordinary toll on human life and health, several Covid-19 vaccines are here.

Surely, this means we can stop wearing a face mask?

Eventually.

As with so much else in this pandemic, there isn’t an easy answer for exactly when we can start to relax. But, clearly, the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, like the ones developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, is our best path out of the crisis.

“We have every reason to believe that these are among some of the very best vaccines that we have ever tested,” said Aaron Richterman, a fellow researching infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania.

Though clinical trials give us confidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines block close to 95 percent of cases of the disease — thereby preventing the most severe outcomes of Covid-19 — there are still some uncertainties. Key among them is how well vaccines work to block transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Vaccines serve not only to protect individuals but also, after a certain threshold of vaccination, the population as a whole. That threshold is herd immunity — where even people who haven’t been vaccinated or infected before are protected because so many of the people around them are immune.

Transmission also has important practical consequences for the risks that arise as vaccinated individuals interact with everyone else, whether that’s in public parks, schools, households, or health care facilities. Early evidence points toward vaccines reducing transmission of Covid-19, but by exactly how much remains unclear.

A recent pre-print paper (not yet peer-reviewed) found that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine reduces viral loads, a key marker that shapes how readily the virus can spread, four-fold between 12 and 28 days after the first dose. It’s a promising result, but it’s based on less than 1,200 patients and needs more validation.

And that’s stirred up a fierce debate lately around how cautious we should be when talking about the power of the vaccines.

The question, given what scientists know and don’t know, is what message should people get about Covid-19 vaccines and how should they behave when they get them?

It’s a difficult needle to thread, to convey both optimism and caution, and there’s disagreement among scientists and experts over what should be the selling point of vaccines in the current moment. If you’re thinking about how your life might change after you get your shots, here’s what to consider.

What we know about Covid-19 vaccines and transmission

The main problem is that while the Covid-19 vaccines now available are amazingly effective at protecting recipients, it’s not clear how much they can prevent them from spreading the virus to other people. And because of that uncertainty, along with the current levels of spread of the disease, public health guidance still calls for the immunized to maintain social distance and wear face masks.

In the meantime, research is underway to figure out how much vaccinated people can transmit the virus. During phase 3 clinical trials, the main thing researchers are looking for is how well vaccines prevent disease — that is, people getting infected and showing detectable symptoms like fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and a loss of taste or smell.

However, asymptomatic transmission has emerged as a major driver of Covid-19. Getting a handle on how much asymptomatic transmission can occur even with a vaccine requires mass testing to detect the virus, since there are no other outward signs of infection. For clinical trials with thousands of participants, testing is a tedious, time-consuming endeavor, and there aren’t many robust findings yet.

That said, there is emerging evidence that Covid-19 vaccines do slow transmission.

Moderna, for example, screened its trial participants for SARS-CoV-2 between the first and second doses of its vaccine, finding that two-thirds fewer people in the vaccine group tested positive for the virus compared to the placebo, according to the company’s briefing to the Food and Drug Administration in December. It suggests that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose.

During the clinical trials for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which has not been approved in the US, researchers tested participants more frequently. An early analysis showed that the vaccine may be 59 percent effective at stopping asymptomatic infection.

There are other signs indicating the vaccines can reduce spread. Changes in immune system markers, like antibodies, in people who are vaccinated comport with what scientists expect in a situation that prevents the virus from setting up shop in people’s airways.

Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the focus on transmission in the context of Covid-19 vaccines can be misleading when comparing them to other vaccines. Part of what’s skewing the picture is that we have more information about Covid-19 transmission dynamics than other respiratory infections. “We never do mass testing for any respiratory virus unless you don’t feel well,” Gandhi said.

There are lessons we can draw from other vaccines, too. Researchers say it’s highly unlikely that a vaccine with a high efficacy against disease wouldn’t also make a significant dent in transmission. In fact, there are vaccines that are given mainly to prevent transmission more so than the disease, like the rubella vaccine, according to Paul Sax, clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School.

For the most part, the evidence is pointing toward Covid-19 vaccines reducing transmission of the virus

With Covid-19 vaccines, the fact that they prevent the most severe outcomes — even if they don’t prevent every instance of disease — can reduce transmission by itself. People with milder symptoms are less likely to cough and spread the virus through the air to others. “Even if it shifts it from symptomatic Covid to asymptomatic Covid, that still is a win for transmission, because asymptomatic people are less likely to transmit it because they don’t have as much virus for as long,” Sax said.

On the other hand, there are other vaccines that can prevent disease but have a much weaker effect on transmission, like the pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccine.

For the most part, the evidence is pointing toward Covid-19 vaccines reducing transmission of the virus. The critical question is by just how much, since that will shape the point where herd immunity occurs. “The exact amount that it reduces asymptomatic transmission is going to have consequences,” Richterman said. The answer will likely emerge in the coming months as researchers gather more data from clinical trials as well as among vaccine recipients in the general population.

What message do we send in the moment?

So scientists generally agree: The vaccines are essential for ending the pandemic, though they will take weeks or months to blunt the spread of Covid-19 across the population. Until that time, it’s necessary to keep up mask-wearing and social distancing in public.

But it’s not as though one day the country will cross a line going from unsafe to safe; rather, there will be a decline in risk over time. “I think the better way to frame it is, the vaccine is going to make every single activity the person does safer,” Richterman said. And while scientists can measure risk and come up with tactics to reduce it, they can’t determine how much risk is tolerable. That’s a value judgment people have to make as individuals.

Vaccines are certainly a major risk-reducer, arguably the largest when it comes to Covid-19. The risk of infection and transmission doesn’t drop to zero with a pair of shots, but when combined with other measures, like wearing face masks, they become a firewall against transmission. Right now, though, in the context of uncontrolled spread of Covid-19, even a reduced risk of transmission could still lead to problematic levels of new infection.

And there’s still a long way to go. Even though upward of one-third of the US population may have already been exposed to the virus, we don’t fully know who has had it because there are so many asymptomatic cases, and because of gaps in testing. It’s also not clear how long immunity lasts after infection and how well it will hold up against new SARS-CoV-2 variants, although early evidence shows immunity does last at least a few months and that prior infections offer some degree of shielding against newer versions of the virus. So the transmission aspect of the pandemic is going to remain a major issue for some time.

“My biggest concern right now in the short term is getting people to make sure they’re not easing up on the precautions they need to take, given the current situation and the lack of vaccine availability,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University.

One of the most delicate times in the pandemic will be the period between its worst throes and widespread immunity. That’s when there will be large groups of people who are vaccinated, as well as those who are not vaccinated, interacting in the same public spaces but with very different risk exposures.

Though some groups have broached the idea of using vaccine passports to identify the immune, there is no easy way to tell whether someone is protected just by looking at them, so across-the-board pandemic restrictions will likely have to remain in place. That may prove frustrating for people who survived the pandemic and went through the trouble of getting immunized but still can’t relax.

The message to those vaccinated people in this twilight period of the pandemic must be that they are duty-bound to keep up precautions like wearing masks in order to protect others, as an act of social solidarity.

But what’s the best way to frame this? Are we in the home stretch of the pandemic, or are we still mired in the worst phase? Should health officials emphasize how vaccines will return everyone to normal or highlight the unknowns and counsel caution? Should the vaccinated be scolded if they start to hang out with friends and travel?

Rasmussen noted that with the uncertainties around the Covid-19 vaccines, as impressive as they are, there is a fear of overpromising and underdelivering. The final results could reveal that vaccines may not block transmission as much as hoped, so if they’re overhyped, trust in public health officials could erode and lead to more vaccine hesitancy.

On the other hand, as groups of people get vaccinated, they might be able to relax around each other as their collective risk declines. Members of a household, neighbors, or people living in long-term care facilities may be able to share the company of others who are also immune.

But even vaccines, masks, and social distancing together won’t stop spread due to reckless behavior, just as airbags, seatbelts, and crumple zones don’t mean that it’s safe to drive inebriated over the speed limit. Vaccines are not a license to resume crowded indoor gatherings, since the overall vaccination rate is still low and the spread of the virus is still high.

“You can potentially get together with your parents that you haven’t seen in a long time if all of you have been vaccinated,” Rasmussen said. “What you should not do is get together with a bunch of your vaccinated friends and go hit the bars.”

Gandhi agreed that precautions will be necessary in many circumstances for people who receive vaccines.

“My risk tolerance is I will wear a mask around those who are unvaccinated,” Gandhi said. “I think many doctors will take off their mask around vaccinated people. And only vaccinated people.”

However, she argued that the messaging emphasis should be on how vaccines will speed up the return to a world outside the pandemic. Belaboring the blank spaces in our understanding of them when there is so much good news could also create hesitancy and undermine progress. Without a sense of progress and an achievable goal, it may get harder to keep up precautions until there is widespread immunity.

“It’s very helpful to tell the public that someday the masks will come off,” Gandhi said. “You can say it will be longer [to get to the end of the pandemic], and it will be, but please keep giving people hope.”

How can we tell we’ve crossed the finish line?

The main benchmark for ending the pandemic — and the goalposts of a vaccination campaign — should be to reduce fatality rates. “We should go all-in for mortality. The first thing we should see is a substantial, substantial reduction in mortality in the population,” said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “Even if we don’t find out that there is reduction in transmission, if enough people are protected and mortality goes down drastically ... even if it’s just individual effects, that’s a good way of returning to normal.”

Such a scenario would downgrade Covid-19 from a lethal public health threat to a moderate concern, and perhaps even a nuisance. Until there is a dramatic decline in fatality rates, however, face masks and social distancing will still be a part of everyone’s life, including those who are vaccinated.

After that, measures of transmission, such as the fraction of Covid-19 tests that yield positive results, could be used as an indicator of how much spread is still occurring.

The US may have to contend with sporadic outbreaks and even vaccine boosters, as immunity declines and new variants of the virus emerge. But widespread immunization creates a scenario where many of the most onerous burdens of the pandemic can be lifted.

Given the pace of progress in vaccinations, that could happen later this year.

“If there are no crazy variants, we can be in a situation where, in fall, things are more normal,” Omer said. “Maybe not fully normal, but better.”",voxdotcom,"['vaccinated', 'transmission', 'unclear', 'risk', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'disease', 'vaccines', 'infection', 'spread', 'viral', 'pandemic', 'effects']",0

Share All sharing options for: Covid-19 vaccines are great — here’s why you also still need to wear a mask for now

After months of exhausting isolation, widespread economic pain, and an extraordinary toll on human life and health, several Covid-19 vaccines are here.

Surely, this means we can stop wearing a face mask?

Eventually.

As with so much else in this pandemic, there isn’t an easy answer for exactly when we can start to relax. But, clearly, the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, like the ones developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, is our best path out of the crisis.

“We have every reason to believe that these are among some of the very best vaccines that we have ever tested,” said Aaron Richterman, a fellow researching infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania.

Though clinical trials give us confidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines block close to 95 percent of cases of the disease — thereby preventing the most severe outcomes of Covid-19 — there are still some uncertainties. Key among them is how well vaccines work to block transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Vaccines serve not only to protect individuals but also, after a certain threshold of vaccination, the population as a whole. That threshold is herd immunity — where even people who haven’t been vaccinated or infected before are protected because so many of the people around them are immune.

Transmission also has important practical consequences for the risks that arise as vaccinated individuals interact with everyone else, whether that’s in public parks, schools, households, or health care facilities. Early evidence points toward vaccines reducing transmission of Covid-19, but by exactly how much remains unclear.

A recent pre-print paper (not yet peer-reviewed) found that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine reduces viral loads, a key marker that shapes how readily the virus can spread, four-fold between 12 and 28 days after the first dose.

It’s easy to look around at the absolute disaster of the past year — the coronavirus upending society, millions unemployed, a looming climate catastrophe, the continued success of The Masked Singer — and decide that no additional people should have to suffer through existence.

So it made intuitive sense when researchers at the Brookings Institution published a study predicting a “COVID baby bust,” arguing that the instability the virus has inflicted on our lives would dramatically lower the birth rate. Extrapolating from data around the 1918 influenza pandemic and the more recent Great Recession that began in 2007, the authors concluded the US would see 300,000 to 500,000 fewer births in 2021. The prediction immediately made headlines.

Even before the pandemic, the US birthrate was already at the lowest point in American history, with just 59.1 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For many years, millennials’ strangled careers and high student debt helped them drive this decline, though the CDC report shows some signs that they’re belatedly coming around to parenthood. In 2018, the birthrate among women ages 30 to 34 was higher than the rate for women ages 25 to 29 for only the third time in almost 80 years. However, the pandemic, with its increased risks to pregnant women, seems poised to derail these trends.

But even if these baby bust predictions are accurate (for example, left unmentioned in the Brookings study are the millions of Americans who were off fighting in World War I for the first nine months of the 1918 flu pandemic, which surely had its own impact on the birthrate), a decline of half a million births would still mean, using 2019’s numbers as an estimate, more than 3 million babies would be born in the US in 2021. Plenty of soon-to-be and would-be parents are pregnant or trying to get pregnant despite these stressful circumstances.

So we decided to speak to several of them, some of whom sheepishly admitted their good fortune in a time of widespread loss, managing to keep their jobs and stay with their partners. Others felt as though the window of their lives wherein they’re able to have a child was rapidly closing, and there wasn’t a lot of reason to wait. Over and over again, we heard a sense of optimism for the future — even if these expectant parents admitted it was, quite possibly, irrational.

But having a child always involves an element of irrational optimism. “We’re generally optimistic people!” one of the parents, Elisa, told us. Universally, the parents we spoke to were looking past the pandemic and imagining the world on the other side, seeing themselves there with their new children. For them, the pandemic was no match for this prenatal magical thinking, much to the relief of the future of humanity.

Scott (47), baby born in December 2020

We found out we were pregnant right at the strike of the lockdown in California. Coronavirus wasn’t a really huge worry just yet. It was like something far off — we heard rumors it was coming. But the idea of things being locked down, that danger felt immediate, and all of a sudden we were very worried about everything. We were like, “What does this mean? What does this mean about doctors?” We heard rumors that maybe dads were not going to be able to be in delivery rooms. We heard all these things about extra dangers. Just layers and layers of new stresses on top of what was there already. Plus, this is our first baby. We had no idea about all this stuff.

Throughout the entire pregnancy, we would go to see her OB, and I would wait in the parking lot and they would FaceTime me. I saw the ultrasound on FaceTime. I tried to hear the heartbeats and stuff, but … that was one thing I couldn’t share with her. But also, we had nothing to compare it to, you know?

In the beginning, we were scared. But it did kind of help having to stay at home, especially for Meaghan, not having to go into work. She couldn’t believe how people do it, how women are able to go in and just function at a job, especially when they’re having to keep it a secret, probably, for the first three months. She couldn’t imagine the hassle of riding the subway while she was pregnant, and if we were in New York, that’s what she would have had to be doing. That’s just the normal thing.

We had the advantage of having to stay at home. Lockdown was perfectly designed for the nesting that we were getting ready to do, you know? To be forced to be here was actually a very wonderful thing.

Having a baby is the most welcome, wonderful distraction throughout this entire lockdown. Having that to look forward to and that to focus on, it’s like more so than anything else, more than any other time we are nesting, forced to nest together in this little house. We’re not seeing people, so why not have this baby join us? We’re able to truly focus on a baby in a way that maybe we wouldn’t have been able to if we weren’t in lockdown.

And it’s not going to last forever, the Covid thing. We’ll come out of it, and it will be great and back to a new normal of some sort. But growing with [our daughter] like this and experiencing her in the beginning like this is actually a pretty pleasant way to experience lockdown.

Emily (33), 33 weeks pregnant (also has an 18-month-old son)

It was unexpected. We didn’t really consider terminating it, per se, because I’m not in my 20s anymore. And the timing is not so bad — I mean, the fact that there is a pandemic was not enough of a deterrent for me. This is not a Walking Dead situation. Though even then, they still had the baby in that show.

Finding out I was pregnant was pretty much a total shock. I mean, honestly, I thought that maybe there was some other medical reason for getting a positive pregnancy test, because we were just so not expecting it. But then I had my appointments, and it was confirmed.

It was a very strange time. At that point, people were still adjusting to lockdown. We were taking a lot of precautions. I wear the mask and the face shield sometimes, when I’m feeling more nervous. I’m that person. But also, we did the food delivery. We were wiping everything down. And, of course, wearing the masks, not really seeing anyone.

I remember reading some comments on different postings for pregnant women that were like, “It’s selfish to have a baby right now. It’s wrong to bring a baby into this kind of environment.” I didn’t really see it as wrong, I guess.

I’m still under 35, so it’s not like I’m at a point where there were major red flags for me to be able to get pregnant again. But at the same time, I do still see it as something that’s a real gift. And I didn’t feel like it was something I could let the environment of the pandemic control. I felt like it’s within my hands to try to make this baby that I’m pregnant with — and then, of course, my son — as safe as possible. So I didn’t feel like there was no hope, sort of. There was never a point where I felt like this is going to just totally be the end of New York or anything. It just felt like we would be able to overcome this.

I am a little nervous about [giving birth] because, I mean, wearing a mask and pushing could be really hard, or just being in the hospital as the infection rate’s going up is pretty scary to me. So I’ve definitely had moments when I really think about that, and that just really does scare me. Hopefully, it will be fine.

Meghann (36), 31 weeks pregnant

For me, even though everything is crazy, this is the best time. I run a business that’s going well, and my husband’s home. We just extended our lease. So I’m like, “Everything’s balanced for me, so I feel ready to have a child.” I’m lucky. I feel really blessed that I feel stable now, when a lot of my friends and family are not, so there just didn’t seem to be a reason to wait.

I’m a born-and-raised New Yorker and still live here. I have felt really grateful for that this year. I don’t live in a small town. I’m half-black, so my kid’s going to be biracial. I think about raising a biracial child in America, and I don’t have to worry about that as much, I feel like, here in New York. But I know that would definitely have been a factor if I lived out in the middle of nowhere, or in Trump country.

One of the hardest parts is that [my husband] is not allowed at any of my regular doctor’s appointments because of Covid restrictions. [At one appointment], they found an abnormality, and it was horrible because I was by myself. I had to hear that. That has been difficult, but he just comes and waits outside, and then I show him the pictures.

At first, I was really mad because I was, like, “How come all these people get to go to brunch and you can’t come in and look at the baby?” I found that really frustrating. It has made me very angry at people that I know, how they’re treating it. It seems very selfish. Then I started to think about people who just, in general, need assistance at medical facilities, who can’t have anybody with them helping them, ever. I think that aspect of it is really upsetting. That’s been the worst part of it, I think.

I haven’t been feeling really well, and I don’t feel like myself. I feel like I can’t do normal things. I don’t have the energy. I don’t feel well all the time. Then there’s this added thing of, when I do have energy, I can’t go out and run my errands. I can’t go out and just get a bunch of stuff done. So I think sometimes that does get to me, and I do get very upset. I’m usually very energetic. I don’t ask my husband to help me with anything, and now I’m asking him to get stuff down for me; I can’t get on the stepladder. It’s just a lot of relying on someone else that I usually don’t do.

Still, I feel optimistic about having a baby now, because no matter what is happening in the world, I know he will be loved and cared for by my husband and I, as well as his extended family. The last year has brought lots into perspective. Everything is fragile and can change at any time. Knowing that on another level now will make my son even more loved, somehow. I am optimistic that I am in the best possible headspace to care for my baby and make him my number one priority.

Elisa (33), 34 weeks pregnant (also has a 3-year-old son)

We knew we wanted to have another kid, and with my son it took longer than we expected. [At the beginning of the pandemic], we were like, “I’m sure it’ll take a while, so we might as well start trying. By the time we actually get pregnant, the pandemic will probably be over.” I think we were optimistic.

I really, honestly didn’t think I would get pregnant so fast. Last time around, we’d had some help from a fertility clinic. Both of us were cognizant that it could work without any additional help; we knew it was a possibility. But there was some element that, if it happens, it’s such an awesome thing that it happens with zero outside help. It would be almost like a sign, and we’d be so happy for it that it’d be fine. And it did; it just happened very quickly.

Maybe it’s like a psychological trick to make yourself feel better, but I don’t regret it. But it’s definitely been a challenge to be pregnant and — soon — to be delivering in a pandemic.

I would say we were always very careful about Covid, but relative to people around us we were maybe on the less neurotically careful side. We always wore our masks, and we washed our hands, and we didn’t hang out with people, but I don’t feel like myself or my husband were, like, super-anxious about getting sick and, like, sanitizing the Amazon packages. We knew people who were that extreme. And to each their comfort levels!

I think the scariest part was when New York was really bad in the early spring. That felt very scary. Just like the vibe was very sad, and it was just overwhelming to think about how many people were impacted. Honestly, even then, we knew we were lucky enough to be working from home in our little bubble. We kept our jobs; we just didn’t feel as exposed as I think a lot of communities did. And maybe that made us more grateful and less worried.

For the first pregnancy, it’s just so many doctor’s appointments. This time, I basically didn’t have a doctor’s appointment between month four and week, like, 30. Two months where all I had was a televisit — they make you take your own blood pressure at home. I had to buy this, like, blood-pressure cuff. I feel like, for kid one, that would have freaked me out, but for kid two I was like, cool, I know what feels normal, and I love avoiding doctor’s appointments.

If I take a deep breath and I’m in a good place, I have zero regrets. And if anything, I feel such excitement about getting to bring this little human into the world and having this positive thing to look forward to. I mean, we’re in a bubble anyway — when you have a newborn, you’re not really doing much.

But then we definitely have these moments where we’re like, oh, my god. It feels a little bit like we’re making some compromises we wouldn’t have had to make if we’d waited. In those moments, I think, I hope we did the right thing. Even when they told me I had low amniotic fluid, and I hadn’t been to the doctor in two and a half months, I thought, how long has this been the case and I didn’t know? Would they have caught it earlier? You get in your head about how this could have played out differently if I’d waited. In those moments, there’s some doubt and angst. But at the same time, you never know how long this is going to last, and there’s never a good time.

We’re generally optimistic people! Maybe that is a determining factor in having a child in a pandemic. In some ways it’s scary, but in other ways it’s like, it will get better. In the grand scheme of my child’s life, this is a blip.

2021-02-01 22:40:06+00:00,3,"On Monday, President Joe Biden is getting his first crack at bipartisan negotiations, and met with a group of 10 Senate Republicans on Monday night to see if there is a compromise to be made on the president’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan.

Biden’s White House has repeatedly said that getting a bipartisan deal done is a top priority. But prolonged negotiations with Republicans, and trying to get to an acceptable middle ground, could complicate both the speed and the boldness of Biden’s first big legislative proposal.

There’s a lot of daylight between Biden’s plan and the $618 billion proposal from the Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). The GOP proposal is less than half of Biden’s proposed price tag, and pares down or doesn’t include many Democratic priorities.

“I am hopeful that we can once again pass a sixth bipartisan Covid relief package,” Collins told reporters following a two-hour meeting at the White House on Monday night. Collins added that while “I wouldn’t say that we came together on a package tonight,” Republicans planned to continue talking with Biden’s team going forward in hopes of reaching an agreement.

The fact that there are 10 Republicans behind the plan is significant; with Democrats controlling a Senate split 50-50, these 10 Republican votes could get the proposal past the 60-vote threshold needed to skirt the Senate filibuster in the unlikely situation that the entire Democratic caucus also gets behind it.

There are two big questions here. One is whether this group of Republican senators sees their $618 billion figure as the starting point for negotiations with Biden and are willing to go higher, or if it’s where they plan to draw a red line. The other question is whether Biden will bite on what they’re proposing. So far, the White House is indicating the president’s not terribly interested.

“There’s obviously a big gap between $600 billion and $1.9 trillion,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday. “Clearly, he thinks the package size needs to be closer to what he proposed than smaller.”

Biden and Democrats don’t actually need any Republican support to pass his package. They technically can get it through the Senate alone via a process called budget reconciliation. While Biden prepared to meet with the Republicans, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday they had filed a joint budget resolution — essentially the first step in the reconciliation process.

Biden made bipartisanship one of the hallmarks of his campaign and emphasized it again in his inauguration speech. Republicans argue working with them on a stimulus package would be a good way to prove Biden’s focus on bipartisanship was more than rhetoric.

“If they want to get it moving fast, work with us on a bipartisan solution,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), one of the 10 Republicans, told Vox in a recent interview. “And then use your political muscle with reconciliation later on, but at least show evidence of the value of working together.”

The White House, however, had repeatedly emphasized that their proposal has broad public support and argued for fast passage of a bold relief bill — which could be delayed by prolonged negotiations.

Congressional Democrats believe Republicans are vastly underestimating the amount of money needed to ensure a strong economic recovery — and they point out the GOP has used the reconciliation process before to quickly advance its priorities, including attempting to unravel the Affordable Care Act.

Who are the Republicans negotiating with Biden?

The group of 10 Republicans who came up with the $618 billion Covid-19 proposal are led by a few moderates who have seemed eager to negotiate with Biden. But the entire group of senators runs the ideological gamut from moderate to conservative, and includes:

Susan Collins (R-ME)

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)

Bill Cassidy (R-LA)

Mitt Romney (R-UT)

Rob Portman (R-OH)

Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV)

Todd Young (R-IN)

Jerry Moran (R-KS)

Mike Rounds (R-SD)

Thom Tillis (R-NC)

It’s important to distinguish this group of Republicans from the bipartisan group of Senate Republicans and Democrats who worked together to propose the framework for a $900 billion Covid-19 relief bill passed back in December. There’s even a newer iteration of that bipartisan group, featuring 16 senators, who have been meeting together to talk about more Covid-19 relief. It’s this 16-senator bipartisan group that has had numerous phone calls with top White House officials, but no face-to-face meetings with Biden himself.

Now, some of the Republican members of that group — namely, Collins, Murkowski, Romney, and Cassidy — are forging their own path. And while this new $618 billion Republican counteroffer doesn’t necessarily spell the end of the bipartisan working group in the Senate, it was entirely a GOP-led effort, a Senate Democratic aide told Vox.

Psaki told reporters Biden was pleased that there was a Republican group eager to meet with him, but reiterated Biden wouldn’t be making any final decisions about their proposal on Monday.

“It’s an exchange of ideas,” Psaki said. “This group sent a letter with some outlines and toplines with their concerns and priorities. What this meeting is not is a forum for the president to make or accept an offer.”

What type of coronavirus stimulus do the 10 GOP senators want?

The GOP proposal is focused largely on speeding up vaccine distribution, allocating $160 billion to that effort. This largely mirrors Biden’s plan, although the president’s overall vaccine plan is closer to $400 billion, including much more money for school reopenings and building up a health care workforce.

Things diverge even more from there.

The Republican plan would fund $300 weekly supplemental unemployment insurance through June (Biden’s plan includes $400 weekly unemployment payments through September). The Republican plan has $1,000 stimulus checks, but only for people making a maximum of $50,000 per year as a single person and $100,000 per year as a couple. (Biden’s plan would send $1,400 stimulus checks to everyone making less than $75,000 at an individual level, and $150,000 as a couple — Democrats, who campaigned on this amount, have been adamant it be included in any final bill).

A lot of Democrats are wondering whether these Republicans see their $618 billion number as the floor or the ceiling for talks with Biden. Vox reached out to five Republican offices asking whether senators viewed the number as a starting point in negotiations, or if they were going to hold firm to the number. As of press time, no office had responded; in a Friday interview with Vox, however, Murkowski appeared to suggest an openness to going higher.

“I want to find a way to be helpful there,” Murkowski told Vox on Friday. “You’ve got a lot of folks that say it’s $1.9 trillion or nothing. Can we agree 80 percent is better than 100 percent? For some, it’s not, and I think that’s some of what we’re seeing right now.”

It’s not yet clear how willing Democrats are to take 80 percent in the name of bipartisanship when they could have 100 percent if they push forward alone. But Democratic leaders will still have a chance to weigh in on the matter, the White House said.

Biden is meeting with this group of Republican senators at the White House before he has a face-to-face meeting with senior Democratic members of congressional leadership like Pelosi and Schumer, though Psaki noted Biden is in regular communication with those two.

“They have been in very close touch with the president directly and members of the senior team,” Psaki told reporters. “There will definitely be Democrats who will be part of conversations here at the White House.”

The GOP is testing whether Biden wants bipartisanship more than a bold bill

President Biden will either be able to have his $1.9 trillion relief bill passed on a party-line vote, or have bipartisanship. He probably can’t have both.

Biden’s White House has repeatedly said he’s open to having a “conversation” about his proposal and is willing to hear “tweaks” and recommendations to improve the bill. What’s less clear is whether the president is willing to lower the scope and ambition of his proposal — especially the $1.9 trillion price tag.

“I’m sure they’d be very happy to work with us if we agreed with everything they proposed,” Sen. Mitt Romney told Vox last week. “How willing they are to work with us if we have ideas about taking this apart and having perhaps two pieces of legislation, or perhaps adjusting certain elements, that’s something they would have to respond to.”

Already, Biden’s White House has unequivocally said they’re not splitting Biden’s package into multiple pieces. And while Biden may be open to lowering the overall number of his plan, Psaki poured cold water on the idea that he’d lower it all the way to $600 billion — repeatedly saying the president believes there’s more danger in Congress doing too little than too much.

There may be room for Biden to meet with Republicans in the middle, but it remains to be seen if both sides are digging in their heels or are ready for some give and take. Republicans have warned that if there’s no room for compromise on Biden’s very first legislative priority, it could spell trouble for negotiations down the line on the president’s upcoming recovery package — which is likely to contain an infrastructure component.

“If we move towards reconciliation next week, I wonder what signal that sends to those of us who want to try to advance solutions that might not be 100 percent solutions but are 80 percent solutions,” Murkowski told Vox.",voxdotcom,"['plan', 'biden', 'group', 'white', 'senators', 'negotiating', 'covid19', 'republican', 'republicans', 'bidens', 'house', 'told', 'relief', 'billion']",0

Share All sharing options for: Covid-19 vaccines are great — here’s why you also still need to wear a mask for now

After months of exhausting isolation, widespread economic pain, and an extraordinary toll on human life and health, several Covid-19 vaccines are here.

Surely, this means we can stop wearing a face mask?

Eventually.

As with so much else in this pandemic, there isn’t an easy answer for exactly when we can start to relax. But, clearly, the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, like the ones developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, is our best path out of the crisis.

“We have every reason to believe that these are among some of the very best vaccines that we have ever tested,” said Aaron Richterman, a fellow researching infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania.

Though clinical trials give us confidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines block close to 95 percent of cases of the disease — thereby preventing the most severe outcomes of Covid-19 — there are still some uncertainties. Key among them is how well vaccines work to block transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Vaccines serve not only to protect individuals but also, after a certain threshold of vaccination, the population as a whole. That threshold is herd immunity — where even people who haven’t been vaccinated or infected before are protected because so many of the people around them are immune.

Transmission also has important practical consequences for the risks that arise as vaccinated individuals interact with everyone else, whether that’s in public parks, schools, households, or health care facilities. Early evidence points toward vaccines reducing transmission of Covid-19, but by exactly how much remains unclear.

A recent pre-print paper (not yet peer-reviewed) found that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine reduces viral loads, a key marker that shapes how readily the virus can spread, four-fold between 12 and 28 days after the first dose. It’s a promising result, but it’s based on less than 1,200 patients and needs more validation.

And that’s stirred up a fierce debate lately around how cautious we should be when talking about the power of the vaccines.

The question, given what scientists know and don’t know, is what message should people get about Covid-19 vaccines and how should they behave when they get them?

It’s a difficult needle to thread, to convey both optimism and caution, and there’s disagreement among scientists and experts over what should be the selling point of vaccines in the current moment. If you’re thinking about how your life might change after you get your shots, here’s what to consider.

What we know about Covid-19 vaccines and transmission

The main problem is that while the Covid-19 vaccines now available are amazingly effective at protecting recipients, it’s not clear how much they can prevent them from spreading the virus to other people. And because of that uncertainty, along with the current levels of spread of the disease, public health guidance still calls for the immunized to maintain social distance and wear face masks.

In the meantime, research is underway to figure out how much vaccinated people can transmit the virus. During phase 3 clinical trials, the main thing researchers are looking for is how well vaccines prevent disease — that is, people getting infected and showing detectable symptoms like fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and a loss of taste or smell.

However, asymptomatic transmission has emerged as a major driver of Covid-19. Getting a handle on how much asymptomatic transmission can occur even with a vaccine requires mass testing to detect the virus, since there are no other outward signs of infection. For clinical trials with thousands of participants, testing is a tedious, time-consuming endeavor, and there aren’t many robust findings yet.

That said, there is emerging evidence that Covid-19 vaccines do slow transmission.

Moderna, for example, screened its trial participants for SARS-CoV-2 between the first and second doses of its vaccine, finding that two-thirds fewer people in the vaccine group tested positive for the virus compared to the placebo, according to the company’s briefing to the Food and Drug Administration in December. It suggests that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose.

During the clinical trials for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which has not been approved in the US, researchers tested participants more frequently. An early analysis showed that the vaccine may be 59 percent effective at stopping asymptomatic infection.

There are other signs indicating the vaccines can reduce spread. Changes in immune system markers, like antibodies, in people who are vaccinated comport with what scientists expect in a situation that prevents the virus from setting up shop in people’s airways.

Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the focus on transmission in the context of Covid-19 vaccines can be misleading when comparing them to other vaccines. Part of what’s skewing the picture is that we have more information about Covid-19 transmission dynamics than other respiratory infections. “We never do mass testing for any respiratory virus unless you don’t feel well,” Gandhi said.

There are lessons we can draw from other vaccines, too. Researchers say it’s highly unlikely that a vaccine with a high efficacy against disease wouldn’t also make a significant dent in transmission. In fact, there are vaccines that are given mainly to prevent transmission more so than the disease, like the rubella vaccine, according to Paul Sax, clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School.

For the most part, the evidence is pointing toward Covid-19 vaccines reducing transmission of the virus

With Covid-19 vaccines, the fact that they prevent the most severe outcomes — even if they don’t prevent every instance of disease — can reduce transmission by itself. People with milder symptoms are less likely to cough and spread the virus through the air to others. “Even if it shifts it from symptomatic Covid to asymptomatic Covid, that still is a win for transmission, because asymptomatic people are less likely to transmit it because they don’t have as much virus for as long,” Sax said.

On the other hand, there are other vaccines that can prevent disease but have a much weaker effect on transmission, like the pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccine.

For the most part, the evidence is pointing toward Covid-19 vaccines reducing transmission of the virus. The critical question is by just how much, since that will shape the point where herd immunity occurs. “The exact amount that it reduces asymptomatic transmission is going to have consequences,” Richterman said. The answer will likely emerge in the coming months as researchers gather more data from clinical trials as well as among vaccine recipients in the general population.

What message do we send in the moment?

So scientists generally agree: The vaccines are essential for ending the pandemic, though they will take weeks or months to blunt the spread of Covid-19 across the population. Until that time, it’s necessary to keep up mask-wearing and social distancing in public.

But it’s not as though one day the country will cross a line going from unsafe to safe; rather, there will be a decline in risk over time. “I think the better way to frame it is, the vaccine is going to make every single activity the person does safer,” Richterman said. And while scientists can measure risk and come up with tactics to reduce it, they can’t determine how much risk is tolerable. That’s a value judgment people have to make as individuals.

Vaccines are certainly a major risk-reducer, arguably the largest when it comes to Covid-19. The risk of infection and transmission doesn’t drop to zero with a pair of shots, but when combined with other measures, like wearing face masks, they become a firewall against transmission. Right now, though, in the context of uncontrolled spread of Covid-19, even a reduced risk of transmission could still lead to problematic levels of new infection.

And there’s still a long way to go. Even though upward of one-third of the US population may have already been exposed to the virus, we don’t fully know who has had it because there are so many asymptomatic cases, and because of gaps in testing. It’s also not clear how long immunity lasts after infection and how well it will hold up against new SARS-CoV-2 variants, although early evidence shows immunity does last at least a few months and that prior infections offer some degree of shielding against newer versions of the virus. So the transmission aspect of the pandemic is going to remain a major issue for some time.

“My biggest concern right now in the short term is getting people to make sure they’re not easing up on the precautions they need to take, given the current situation and the lack of vaccine availability,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University.

One of the most delicate times in the pandemic will be the period between its worst throes and widespread immunity. That’s when there will be large groups of people who are vaccinated, as well as those who are not vaccinated, interacting in the same public spaces but with very different risk exposures.

Though some groups have broached the idea of using vaccine passports to identify the immune, there is no easy way to tell whether someone is protected just by looking at them, so across-the-board pandemic restrictions will likely have to remain in place. That may prove frustrating for people who survived the pandemic and went through the trouble of getting immunized but still can’t relax.

The message to those vaccinated people in this twilight period of the pandemic must be that they are duty-bound to keep up precautions like wearing masks in order to protect others, as an act of social solidarity.

But what’s the best way to frame this? Are we in the home stretch of the pandemic, or are we still mired in the worst phase? Should health officials emphasize how vaccines will return everyone to normal or highlight the unknowns and counsel caution? Should the vaccinated be scolded if they start to hang out with friends and travel?

Rasmussen noted that with the uncertainties around the Covid-19 vaccines, as impressive as they are, there is a fear of overpromising and underdelivering. The final results could reveal that vaccines may not block transmission as much as hoped, so if they’re overhyped, trust in public health officials could erode and lead to more vaccine hesitancy.

On the other hand, as groups of people get vaccinated, they might be able to relax around each other as their collective risk declines. Members of a household, neighbors, or people living in long-term care facilities may be able to share the company of others who are also immune.

But even vaccines, masks, and social distancing together won’t stop spread due to reckless behavior, just as airbags, seatbelts, and crumple zones don’t mean that it’s safe to drive inebriated over the speed limit. Vaccines are not a license to resume crowded indoor gatherings, since the overall vaccination rate is still low and the spread of the virus is still high.

“You can potentially get together with your parents that you haven’t seen in a long time if all of you have been vaccinated,” Rasmussen said. “What you should not do is get together with a bunch of your vaccinated friends and go hit the bars.”

Gandhi agreed that precautions will be necessary in many circumstances for people who receive vaccines.

“My risk tolerance is I will wear a mask around those who are unvaccinated,” Gandhi said. “I think many doctors will take off their mask around vaccinated people. And only vaccinated people.”

However, she argued that the messaging emphasis should be on how vaccines will speed up the return to a world outside the pandemic. Belaboring the blank spaces in our understanding of them when there is so much good news could also create hesitancy and undermine progress. Without a sense of progress and an achievable goal, it may get harder to keep up precautions until there is widespread immunity.

“It’s very helpful to tell the public that someday the masks will come off,” Gandhi said. “You can say it will be longer [to get to the end of the pandemic], and it will be, but please keep giving people hope.”

How can we tell we’ve crossed the finish line?

The main benchmark for ending the pandemic — and the goalposts of a vaccination campaign — should be to reduce fatality rates. “We should go all-in for mortality. The first thing we should see is a substantial, substantial reduction in mortality in the population,” said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “Even if we don’t find out that there is reduction in transmission, if enough people are protected and mortality goes down drastically ... even if it’s just individual effects, that’s a good way of returning to normal.”

Such a scenario would downgrade Covid-19 from a lethal public health threat to a moderate concern, and perhaps even a nuisance. Until there is a dramatic decline in fatality rates, however, face masks and social distancing will still be a part of everyone’s life, including those who are vaccinated.

After that, measures of transmission, such as the fraction of Covid-19 tests that yield positive results, could be used as an indicator of how much spread is still occurring.

The US may have to contend with sporadic outbreaks and even vaccine boosters, as immunity declines and new variants of the virus emerge. But widespread immunization creates a scenario where many of the most onerous burdens of the pandemic can be lifted.

Given the pace of progress in vaccinations, that could happen later this year.

“If there are no crazy variants, we can be in a situation where, in fall, things are more normal,” Omer said. “Maybe not fully normal, but better.”",voxdotcom,"['vaccinated', 'transmission', 'unclear', 'risk', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'disease', 'vaccines', 'infection', 'spread', 'viral', 'pandemic', 'effects']",0
2021-02-01 14:30:05+00:00,19,"“Happy vaccination day!” the nurse administering my Covid-19 vaccine tells me as I lower myself into her chair. Almost a year of social distancing has made me highly attuned to all the surfaces I’m touching: my elbow leaning on the desk, my hands signing the vaccine card with the pen.

The hospital where I work as a research scientist in a synthetic biology lab is vaccinating all its staff, and excited voices from all sorts of people — scruffy graduate students, put-together receptionists — fill the air. One thing is immediately noticeable, though: As someone who is Pakistani, I am one of the few people of color in the vaccination room. Even in a hospital in a city that is majority people of color, those being vaccinated are mostly white.

Recent polls show non-white people in the US are becoming more willing to take the vaccine, but continue to express more hesitancy than white people. This did not hit home for me until I realized that my cousin, a medical resident who grew up in Pakistan and now works in Texas, refused the vaccine. He was urged by members of our family to wait for more data, and even though he works directly with Covid-19 patients, he decided that, for now, he would not get vaccinated.

I was livid when I found out about his decision, blaming myself for the unread family group chats and ignored video calls. Could I have convinced him by pointing out the compelling data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine? Or with the fact that developers have been extremely transparent about the small numbers of people who have shown adverse reactions? Or by reminding him that everyone in my family is vaccinated against other diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella; tetanus; tuberculosis, even, with the controversial BCG vaccine — used in Pakistan for decades after it was discontinued in the US — that left us all with puckered scars on our arms?

There are many roots of distrust around Covid-19 vaccines, but it feels imperative to put them in the context of Pakistan’s recent history. The country where most of my family grew up struggles with vicious vaccination battles of its own, particularly with distrust around the polio vaccine. This distrust doesn’t come out of nowhere.

In the early 2010s, the CIA ran a fake vaccination program in Abbottabad, offering free Hepatitis B vaccines to children in an attempt to collect DNA evidence linking Osama bin Laden to the compound where he was suspected of residing. It is unclear how samples were to be collected or how they would lead to bin Laden, but when news of this scheme broke, it added proof to existing conspiracy theories about vaccinations. As a consequence, many local leaders began urging people not to vaccinate their kids, various districts banned vaccination teams, and the Taliban issued a fatwa against vaccination programs. To this day, local leaders rail against vaccines as Western spying programs.

In 2013, in response to pressure from leaders in public health and science, the CIA promised to stop using vaccination programs to gather intelligence. However, the legacy of the fake vaccine campaign in Pakistan has understandably not been easy to overcome. Trust in public health officials has been dangerously eroded.

Pakistan is one of the three countries in the world where polio has not been eradicated. Along with neighboring Afghanistan, the country is seeing its highest increase in polio cases since 2014: 54 cases were reported in the first quarter of 2020, up four times from the year before. Polio vaccinators are targeted with violence; since 2012, at least 95 polio workers, including many women, are estimated to have been killed in attacks. As recently as this December, members of a vaccination team were wounded or killed in an incident that garnered very little coverage in the media.

Pakistan is not the only country with a history of medicalized violence. In the US, there is a long history of Black and brown people being used for medical experimentation, and it feels unsurprising that many other people of color I have come across have expressed hesitation about the Covid-19 vaccine.

The Black nurse who swabbed my nose for a PCR test last week says she didn’t take the vaccine when it was offered to her because she wanted to wait for the next round in case there were any side effects. The Latino delivery person at work tells me he turned down the vaccine because it hasn’t been tested properly. My friend, a Black organizer and educator, says on a Zoom meeting that she’s not going to take the vaccine because she doesn’t trust the medical establishment.

Vaccine distrust in the US cannot be divorced from recent history. In a class I teach on the legacy of racism in science research, we read about the US government’s study of untreated syphilis on Black men in Tuskegee; about J. Marion Sims, who carried out practice surgeries without anesthesia on enslaved Black women, who had a statue memorializing him as the “father of gynecology” in Central Park as recently as 2018; about Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman whose tumor cells were used without her consent to develop a cell line for cancer research; about glaring health disparities between white and BIPOC communities.

“Why didn’t we know about this?” ask my white, East Asian, and South Asian students. “Why didn’t we learn this in our science classes?” It’s hard not to feel like the forgetting is willful, and willful forgetting only creates more distrust.

For Covid-19 vaccination programs to undo distrust in time for the mass drives that will be needed to build herd immunity, what is needed is willful remembering and willful repair. It is morally imperative that vaccination drives engage with the history of medical harm in the US and abroad, acknowledge the role that both the government and individual scientists have played, and repair the fissures with community outreach, material resources, and firm commitments to undoing health disparities between white and non-white people.

Until that happens, the success of the Covid-19 vaccination program is going to come down to something Black doctors and scientists have already been doing: making individual pitches to their communities and families to take the vaccine. Here’s mine: I’m a Pakistani scientist who has looked at the data from the clinical trials of the vaccine and has decided to take the vaccine.

I feel happy that I got this chance, and that happiness lives with other feelings. I feel relief knowing I’m unlikely to get Covid-19, a horrible disease that has known long-lasting side effects, and I’d rather risk the unknown side effects of the vaccine for the relief of knowing I won’t pass the virus to more vulnerable members of society.

I feel anger, too, that BIPOCs will continue to die because of the legacies of medical racism, that children in Pakistan will die of polio despite an effective vaccine. And I feel guilt for receiving the Covid-19 vaccine ahead of so many others: my father, who lives in Pakistan and is immunocompromised; essential workers such as bus drivers and those in the food distribution chain who kept this country running during the pandemic; everyone who lives in a non-Western country who isn’t anticipated to receive the vaccine until 2024.

None of which I tell the nurse who wishes me a happy vaccination day. I sit patiently as she asks me questions about allergies, fills out my vaccine card, and loads up a syringe. “Wait,” I ask right as she’s about to jab me, a little embarrassed at what I’m about to ask. “Can I take a selfie?”

“Of course!” she says. “Will you do me a favor and post it with a positive message? So that more people get the vaccine?”

I promise her I will.

Share All sharing options for: Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new Covid-19 variants, in 2 charts

A more contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is a deadlier one. Not because it gets any individual sicker but because it reaches more people. More illness means more cases: more mild cases, more severe cases, more long-term complications, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.

There’s no one perfect estimate for how much more contagious the SARS-CoV-2 variant called B.1.1.7, which was first discovered in the UK, might be. There needs to be more careful lab work done in animals to nail it down, which could take a few more weeks. But preliminary estimates find it to be between 30 percent and 70 percent more contagious. This variant is now popping up all over the world: in the US, throughout Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere. It’s especially concerning, considering that, in the US and elsewhere, the pandemic’s spread is still reaching new heights.

There’s also a variant called 501Y.V2 that was first found in South Africa; it appears less widespread than B.1.1.7, but also to be more contagious than older variants. It’s still possible that other more transmissible variants will emerge in the future. Scientists just don’t know.

Regardless of exactly how transmissible any new variant is, any possible increase in transmissibility is extremely concerning to epidemiologists and others in public health. It means now, more than ever, our collective and individual actions to stop the spread are critically important.

Here are a few key reasons why.

A more transmissible virus simply means more cases

The reason for concern over a more contagious variant of the virus is simple. “Once it [the variant] becomes common, it will accelerate transmission considerably,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a press call. Accelerated transmission means more cases.

That’s because the virus grows exponentially. Any increase in its inherent transmissibility causes an increasingly high number of cases down the line, if control measures don’t also accelerate to keep up.

With a 50 percent increase in infectiousness, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch says. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” It could be higher, he says.

A more transmissible virus means we need to work harder to stop the spread

Epidemiologists think about the transmissibility of a virus with a figure called R, or the basic reproduction number. This describes how many new cases, on average, will follow one case of the virus.

In the beginning of the outbreak, before the world sprang into action, epidemiologists estimated the R to be around 2 or 3. Since then, thanks to our (inconsistently implemented) efforts — mask-wearing, social distancing, business closures, etc — the R has been reduced in many states to around 1.1 to 1.2. But as long as the R figure is greater than 1, the virus can spread exponentially.

Let’s say a community has gotten its R value down to 1. Then a 50 percent more transmissible variant comes along. It could mean that the same mitigation effort that got the old variant of the virus down to 1 now only gets it down to 1.5.

Which is to say: To combat a more transmissible version of the virus, communities need even more stringent controls.

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Let’s say a community has the virus more or less under control. The R value in the area is 1, which means the number of cases in the area remains constant, month to month.

In this scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, and you’ll have 1,000 cases a month from now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes it takes about five days for one infection to cause another). “Now let’s imagine the virus is 50 percent more transmissible. .... 1,000 cases of such a virus now would translate to more than 10,000 cases a month from now if you did nothing!”

A more transmissible virus increases the number of people who need to be vaccinated

A more transmissible virus also increases the threshold for herd immunity, or the rough estimate of the percentage of people in a population who need to achieve immunity, ideally via a vaccination, in order for the outbreak to decrease in size.

Herd immunity thresholds are dependent on the value of R. The higher the R value, the higher the threshold. If a more transmissible variant becomes dominant the world over, it increases pressure on vaccination campaigns to vaccinate even more people. Already, it’s looking like upward of 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to achieve herd immunity (though the exact figure needed is unknown). That’s already an extremely high and difficult bar to clear, given the slow early distribution of the vaccines.

There’s also the yet-to-be-realized possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that reduces the efficacy of the current vaccines.

A more transmissible virus means more death

One good piece of news about the B.1.1.7 variant: So far, it doesn’t seem to be any deadlier than older variants of the virus. That is: Any individual who gets it isn’t any more likely to end up in the hospital or die, according to the early data.

But more infections mean more death. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Switzerland, says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

A 50 percent more contagious virus is even a deadlier concern than one that’s 50 percent more deadly, as London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains on Twitter.

If a city has an R value of 1.1 and there are 10,000 people infected, in one month’s time, you’d expect to see 129 deaths, he says.

Increase the deadliness of the virus by 50 percent in that scenario and you’d expect 193 deaths — a 49.6 percent increase.

Increase the contagiousness of the virus in this scenario by 50 percent and you get 978 deaths, Kucharski finds. That’s a 658 percent increase. That’s a theoretical calculation, but the central point is the exponential effect, as Kucharski explains.

The above is just an illustrative example, but the key message: an increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity). 5/5 — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) December 28, 2020

It’s not entirely clear if this will come to pass

Again, the estimate of 50 percent increased transmissibility is just an estimate. And even if new variants are more transmissible, it could be hard to predict how much more transmissible it will be in different locations.

Hanage stresses that the 50 percent more transmissible figure being reported is based on how this variant behaves in the UK. In a different place — with different adherences to social distancing, different mitigation measures in place — the new variant could behave differently. It’s complicated, yes, but that’s outbreaks for you.

But even the hypothetical threat of a more transmissible variant is a call for action.

To stop more mutations from happening, to stop more potentially problematic variants from popping up, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, told me in a December interview. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

The new variant mean our individual actions matter more than ever. This variant spreads in the same manner as other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the same precautions apply. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and ventilation are as important as ever.

With the new variant around, Lipsitch says, “Your isolation and quarantine and contact tracing is considerably more important, even more than it was before. So you’re doing more for the world.”",voxdotcom,"['r', 'epidemiologists', 'means', 'thats', 'virus', 'covid19', 'worried', 'charts', 'variant', '50', 'variants', 'transmissible', 'cases', 'number']",0
2021-01-31 11:57:09+00:00,24,"Editor’s note, January 10, 2022: This article was originally published in February 2021, and public health guidance around masking to prevent Covid-19 transmission may have shifted. For Vox’s latest coverage on the pandemic, see here.

My favorite face mask is a sleek black cloth number — it goes with everything, it doesn’t chafe my face, and it’s sold in a relatively affordable three-pack, so I always have a backup. I have a whole collection of cloth masks, like you probably do, cobbled together at random, in bright colors and patterns, generally homemade by an assortment of people in my life.

Yet, as we’ve slipped into allowing our face coverings to project our tastes while they protect us, there’s another element of style that’s often forgotten: fit. And fit is incredibly important when it comes to how effective our masks are.

Tons of celebrities have been seen out with their masks underneath their noses. Notably, members of Congress who promote masking up have been seen pulling up their sliding masks in public.

Cloth masks sometimes lend themselves to poor etiquette: Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) slipped his down to sneeze into his hand on C-SPAN, which is, to put it plainly, horrifying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is known to have masks that match her outfits but was once photographed in a conversation with George Floyd’s brother, mask hanging down below her mouth. And soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden’s mask slipped down his face in the midst of signing an executive action related to Covid-19. It happens to the best of us. Walk around anywhere in pandemic America, and you’ll surely encounter people fiddling with their masks.

But in order to truly protect you, cloth masks need to have a snug fit. And wearing a well-fitted mask might be more important than it’s ever been in the pandemic. As previously reported by Julia Belluz for Vox, a more contagious new variant of Covid-19, known as B.1.1.7, that’s now spreading around the world, should make us even more cautious about our risk of exposure to the virus, especially in indoor spaces.

Mask fit really matters

Proper mask-wearing remains a key factor in preventing the transmission of the coronavirus. A mask slip can leave the wearer extremely vulnerable, as the nasal passage is a common entryway for the virus to get into the body. According to a study in Nature Medicine, the virus attaches to certain proteins found in the nasal passage. There are actually more of these proteins in the nose than in the lungs, making an exposed nose a serious threat. You don’t want any viral particles getting to your nose, so it’s imperative that your mask has a tight fit.

Cloth masks are still fine for the general public to use, experts tell me, so don’t feel like you have to run out and buy a medical-grade mask like an N95. We think about what our masks look like every day, but we are largely ignoring the importance of the proper fit. There’s not enough emphasis on what makes a mask well-fitted and effective — we’ve gotten distracted with design, when really we need to be worrying about how comfortable our masks are and whether or not they are secure enough to rely on.

The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force, a research group based out of Cambridge University, investigates the efficacy and improvement of civilian face masks and fabrics. “What we found through our research is that the actual filtration material is not as important as fit. In order to get any benefit from a high filtration material, you have to have fit,” Eugenia O’Kelly, a PhD student who heads the group, said. O’Kelly emphasized that without highly specialized machinery, there is no way to be 100 percent sure your mask fits, but did have tips for improved fit and protection.

According to her team’s tests, double masking can be helpful. “Keep in mind, you do not end up numerically doubling your protection by layering masks. I have seen a lot of this type of ‘math’ online, but unfortunately, this is not how depth filtration works,” she said. But doubling up can ensure you get a better seal around the nose and mouth than one mask alone that might be a bit too loose. According to the new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released February 10, well-fitted surgical masks or a “cloth and surgical mask combination” can reduced virus transmission by up to 96.5 percent. The director of the CDC has also urged Americans to wear a mask with “two or more layers,” the New York Times reports.

O’Kelly says there are two methods scientists use to find out if a mask fits. “You can have quantitative fitting and qualitative fitting. In quantitative fitting, you are measuring the amount of particles inside and outside of the mask,” she said. Most surgical masks don’t fit tightly enough, or are made of material without sufficient filtration, so they won’t pass.

Quantitative fitting can be expensive because it requires specialized hospital equipment. “More common is qualitative mask fitting,” she said, for which her team is experimenting with using aroma diffusers as a test. If you are wearing a mask and can taste the particles through it, it’s a sign that your mask is ill-fitting.

In order to identify if your mask is good at protecting others, O’Kelly recommends avoiding masks with the following characteristics:

Thin material: If you can see any gaps between the fibers when you hold it to the light, that is a sign that viruses can get through. Single-layer: If your mask only has one (or even two) layers of fabric, the filtration is probably not high. The best masks have multiple layers or have a pocket to insert a filter, such as a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter. Poor fit: Fit is very important in a mask’s success, as you can read about in this recent study. You may not be able to get a mask that fits you perfectly, but the more and larger the gaps you see, the poorer the fit is. This may be more important when protecting the wearer than others. Discomfort: If the mask is very uncomfortable, you may be less likely to wear it correctly, and more likely to touch the outside of the mask or adjust it while out and about.

So how should a mask fit? “The mask should be a good fit over the nose and mouth, but not overly tight to impair breathing. It is not intended to filter out all the air one breathes, but intended to hold back droplets from our mouth from spreading in the air,” George Abraham, the chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine’s Infectious Disease Board, tells me.

There’s not a lot we can do to prevent a mask from falling down — except maybe try to find a mask that fits better.

O’Kelly also recommends doing a fit check, although there is no reliable way to currently assess the fit of fabric masks. “Move your hand around the edges of the mask where it makes contact with your skin and see if you can feel any air. If you feel the air, there is a gap,” she said. But just because a mask has a gap does not mean it’s totally ineffective. It just means it’s not providing the maximum level of protection possible. According to O’Kelly, a fabric mask with fit issues can protect the user from over 50 percent of particles, and well-constructed fabric masks with gaps still can filter over 75 percent of particles.

In a Consumer Reports article, William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, recommends tightening your mask if it slips off your nose. You can adjust the strings and make sure there isn’t any space for air on the sides. Our best bet is selecting a mask that fits properly: snug around the nose and mouth without gaps at the sides. A wire nose bridge can help your mask mold to your face. The Respiratory Protection Engineering Task Force’s studies have found that a metal nose band can improve fit. However, in less structured or elastic masks, that nose band can also harm performance, so the user has to make a judgment call.

But shouldn’t we just get N95s?

As comforting as it might be that experts say cloth masks are sufficient, the United States is far behind countries like Austria, where the government provides FFP2 masks to citizens, and Taiwan, where the government has been providing citizens with high-quality masks that are probably going to fit better than some of the cloth masks in circulation. Why can’t the same happen here in the United States?

The argument for the government to supply masks is not new. It might do Americans well to have better PPE, but there are a lot of caveats that come with the use of heavy-duty masks like the N95. In an email, Abraham told me that it would be difficult for the government to make sure that everyone had an effective N95. “The wearer needs to be ‘fit-tested’ so that the mask being used is not leaking but forms a good seal on the face, or else the ability of the mask to filter is lost,” he wrote. “As a practical reality, that is not consistently possible with the general public.”

There are ways to test the N95 — “you could place both hands around the rim of the mask, once on the face, and blow hard into it. If you feel air on your hands, you know the mask is not a tight fit,” Abraham explains. But according to experts, it is also not 100 percent accurate.

The N95 masks are a must for health care workers because they’re great for long exposure situations, but they might be excessive for short-term use, according to Abraham. An N95 mask might be more appropriate for a long plane ride, for example, instead of a quick run to the grocery store. “The use of the mask would be inconsistent, without doing a fit check every time,” Abraham said, and it would be “cost-prohibitive and accomplish little.” The government couldn’t regulate the N95 use of every civilian, and the respirators would be rendered useless if not properly fitting.

While the research O’Kelly’s group has done on mask materials is still being peer-reviewed, she says that even a mask with poor fit is better than not wearing one at all. “If you can see a gap at all, your mask is probably not functioning at 100 percent. However, that certainly does not mean the mask is useless if there are gaps.” Any kind of gap can compromise the effectiveness of a mask, so it is important to try to make sure there are no spaces if possible.

So next time you find yourself tugging at your face mask all day, consider finding another style or model that may work better. For extra protection, spend a little more money to get a mask with a pocket to add a PM 2.5 or HEPA filter, and shop around to get multiple masks that you can fit check at home. Mask slipping plagues us, but if we work at it, we can ward off the actual plague. It might take some trial and error, but this is worth getting right.",voxdotcom,"['nose', 'fits', 'important', 'masks', 'mask', 'fit', 'filter', 'better', 'face', 'air', 'cloth', 'vs', 'n95', 'answer']",0

2021-01-30 15:51:41+00:00,27,"A panel of expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously on Friday afternoon to recommend the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson for an emergency use authorization. The next step is for the FDA to accept the recommendation, which could happen as soon as this weekend, clearing the way for distribution.

Earlier this week, the FDA posted a briefing going over the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which included 40,000 participants in several countries divided randomly into placebo and treatment groups.

The most important finding: The vaccine was 100 percent effective after 28 days at preventing deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 among the clinical trial participants who received the treatment. (Two vaccine recipients were hospitalized with Covid-19 two weeks after receiving the injection.)

The vaccine was also 66.1 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness after four weeks, with consistent results across all age groups. When looking at blocking severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.4 percent effective.

Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, said during a press conference last month that the vaccine also had “plain vanilla safety results,” with the vast majority of recipients experiencing no problems. Most of the reported symptoms were mild, including fatigue, arm pain, and fever.

The efficacy levels against severe to critical Covid-19 changed depending on where the vaccine was tested. It was 85.9 percent in the United States after four weeks, while in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, efficacy against severe disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.

Health officials say that while the Johnson & Johnson efficacy results are not as high as those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, the two vaccines that have already received emergency use authorizations from the FDA, the new vaccine’s performance is still superb.

“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the press conference last month. The vaccine was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson based in Belgium, together with Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson’s doesn’t require a booster shot, circumventing the two-dose problems posed by its competitors. There’s no need to track people down for their second dose, which means more people could be vaccinated faster. The shots also don’t require deep-cold storage, which means they’re less costly and somewhat easier to distribute.

“It’s a complete game changer,” said Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin. “It completely changes the equation.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also different in another way. It uses an adenovirus vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also less expensive to manufacture than the mRNA platform used for the other vaccines. (It’s estimated to cost around $10 per vaccine dose — roughly half the cost of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.)

Johnson & Johnson has promised enough vaccines for 20 million Americans by the end of March and 100 million Americans by the end of June despite production challenges. It would be a huge boost to the 65 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in the US so far.

So even with an overall efficacy level that’s lower than the two other vaccines on the US market, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could become a major player. It’s the vaccine that “can increase equity,” said Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, particularly “if it’s deployed strategically in nations that are hard to reach and where that would be a particular challenge under a two-dose schedule.” Johnson & Johnson expects to distribute a billion doses of its vaccine worldwide this year.

But as amazing as it is to see several effective Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time, it’s now clear that the technology alone won’t save the day. An orchestra of supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, staff, and public trust needs to harmonize in order to actually get billions of shots into arms around the world and finally draw the pandemic to a close. And we also have other hurdles to overcome: controlling the spread of variants that seem to be threatening the effectiveness of all the vaccines we have.

What we learned about the safety and efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine

Johnson & Johnson launched separate clinical trials testing both a one-dose and a two-dose regimen to see how well these strategies provided long-term protection against Covid-19. The one-dose phase 3 trial arm yielded efficacy results first.

But hints that this vaccine could be safe and effective have been trickling out for months. The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

“You know, we’ve got millions of people who’ve received these vaccines already, which is exciting,” he added. “We’re on our way.”",voxdotcom,"['advisers', 'vector', 'phase', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'world', 'johnson', 'recommend', 'johnsons', 'fda', 'adenovirus', 'unanimously', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-30 13:50:36+00:00,39,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0
2021-01-30 11:00:46+00:00,37,"A panel of expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously on Friday afternoon to recommend the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson for an emergency use authorization. The next step is for the FDA to accept the recommendation, which could happen as soon as this weekend, clearing the way for distribution.

Earlier this week, the FDA posted a briefing going over the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which included 40,000 participants in several countries divided randomly into placebo and treatment groups.

The most important finding: The vaccine was 100 percent effective after 28 days at preventing deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 among the clinical trial participants who received the treatment. (Two vaccine recipients were hospitalized with Covid-19 two weeks after receiving the injection.)

The vaccine was also 66.1 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness after four weeks, with consistent results across all age groups. When looking at blocking severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.4 percent effective.

Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, said during a press conference last month that the vaccine also had “plain vanilla safety results,” with the vast majority of recipients experiencing no problems. Most of the reported symptoms were mild, including fatigue, arm pain, and fever.

The efficacy levels against severe to critical Covid-19 changed depending on where the vaccine was tested. It was 85.9 percent in the United States after four weeks, while in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, efficacy against severe disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.

Health officials say that while the Johnson & Johnson efficacy results are not as high as those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, the two vaccines that have already received emergency use authorizations from the FDA, the new vaccine’s performance is still superb.

“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the press conference last month. The vaccine was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson based in Belgium, together with Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson’s doesn’t require a booster shot, circumventing the two-dose problems posed by its competitors. There’s no need to track people down for their second dose, which means more people could be vaccinated faster. The shots also don’t require deep-cold storage, which means they’re less costly and somewhat easier to distribute.

“It’s a complete game changer,” said Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin. “It completely changes the equation.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also different in another way. It uses an adenovirus vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also less expensive to manufacture than the mRNA platform used for the other vaccines. (It’s estimated to cost around $10 per vaccine dose — roughly half the cost of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.)

Johnson & Johnson has promised enough vaccines for 20 million Americans by the end of March and 100 million Americans by the end of June despite production challenges. It would be a huge boost to the 65 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in the US so far.

So even with an overall efficacy level that’s lower than the two other vaccines on the US market, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could become a major player. It’s the vaccine that “can increase equity,” said Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, particularly “if it’s deployed strategically in nations that are hard to reach and where that would be a particular challenge under a two-dose schedule.” Johnson & Johnson expects to distribute a billion doses of its vaccine worldwide this year.

But as amazing as it is to see several effective Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time, it’s now clear that the technology alone won’t save the day. An orchestra of supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, staff, and public trust needs to harmonize in order to actually get billions of shots into arms around the world and finally draw the pandemic to a close. And we also have other hurdles to overcome: controlling the spread of variants that seem to be threatening the effectiveness of all the vaccines we have.

What we learned about the safety and efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine

Johnson & Johnson launched separate clinical trials testing both a one-dose and a two-dose regimen to see how well these strategies provided long-term protection against Covid-19. The one-dose phase 3 trial arm yielded efficacy results first.

But hints that this vaccine could be safe and effective have been trickling out for months. The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

2021-01-29 19:10:10+00:00,13,"As America’s bumpy Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues, a lot of people still have one very big question: When can I get a Covid-19 vaccine?

For the vast majority of people, we don’t know yet. There are too many variables, from how much the new federal government can improve vaccination rates to which vaccines get approved for use in the future, muddying any potential predictions for vaccines.

Under federal guidelines and states’ current plans, the US has made vaccines available to limited groups of people: health care workers and nursing home residents first, with older Americans (particularly 65 and up) and at least some groups of essential workers to follow.

For the rest of the country, how quickly you might get a vaccine depends entirely on the pace of the rollout; that will dictate when it’s finally your turn in the line. And right now, too much is changing to get hard answers for when everyone will be able to get a vaccine.

As it stands, about 1.2 million people in the US are getting either their first or second Covid-19 vaccine dose a day. With nearly 22 million Americans already getting at least their first shot, the country is currently on track to hit a 75 percent vaccination rate — a possible herd immunity threshold — as late as early 2022. At current rates, getting every person in the US vaccinated — a lofty goal — could take until as late as summer 2022.

That’s definitely alarming, given that no one wants this to take until next year. But experts and government officials expect the pace of vaccinations to start to pick up in the coming months — although that can only happen if the Biden administration, states, and vaccine producers fix a host of problems hindering America’s vaccination campaign.

There are still a lot of unknowns

President Joe Biden this week revised his previous goal of 1 million shots a day (for 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office) — which the country neared before Biden took office — to 1.5 million a day. That would get the US to the 75 percent threshold as late as the end of this year and the 100 percent mark as late as spring of next year.

But as Biden has repeatedly cautioned, these goals are only the beginning. Experts have called on the government to increase the rate of vaccination to 2 million or 3 million shots a day, which could allow the country to reach 75 percent in the summer or fall and vaccinate everyone else by the end of the year. That would mean herd immunity, when the enough of the population is protected that the virus can’t spread easily, would arrive sooner, but going that quickly will likely require a much more involved federal campaign than we’ve had in the first few weeks of the vaccine rollout.

Even if the country doesn’t boost vaccination rates, there’s another big factor that could speed up the vaccine campaign: a one-dose vaccine. The two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved by the federal government currently require two doses, split weeks apart. But other companies, like Johnson & Johnson, are working on one-dose vaccines. If they prove effective and get federal approval, that could speed up the vaccination process by as much as twice over.

But that depends on these vaccines getting approved and being as good as Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that the data shows to be 90-plus percent effective against preventing Covid-19. Otherwise, a lot of Americans may want to continue getting a more demanding but more effective two-shot regiment — limiting the one-shot vaccine’s potential impact. (The latest reported results show Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is very effective, especially at preventing severe illness and death, but may not be as effective, particularly at stopping mild disease, as the two-shot vaccines.)

Meanwhile, federal regulators still haven’t approved a vaccine for children. And it remains unclear when they will — it’s a matter of getting the proper trials and data first.

Another variable is how many Americans actually want and will get a vaccine. Currently, surveys suggest about one in five Americans are still hesitant. That might be bad news for hitting herd immunity and sufficient population protection. But it could be good for people who want to be vaccinated quicker, since it means less competition.

All of that is to say that there are still a lot of unknowns: Can public officials and private actors improve the rate of vaccination dramatically? Will vaccines get approval, including for kids? Will those approvals speed up the process? How many Americans want to and will get a vaccine?

The answers to those questions, and more, will dictate when everyone who’s waiting for a vaccine can actually get one.

What’s currently going wrong with the vaccine rollout

For now, the most pressing problem to everyone getting a shot still seems to be the “last mile” of the distribution chain, when vaccines go from storage to shots in arms.

If you look at America’s vaccine rollout, it can seem like a bunch of different problems from place to place — from vaccine doses going unused to equipment breaking down to long lines and insufficient staffing at vaccination sites.

But many of these issues are likely rooted in one overarching problem: a lack of federal support for notoriously underresourced public health agencies.

To put it another way: If you asked a bunch of underfunded public health agencies to do a big task in a large, diverse country, then refused more support to help them carry out this task, you would actually expect a lot of different problems to arise by virtue of the country being a big, diverse place. The root problem is a lack of federal support, but how that problem looks in different places will vary widely based on geography, demographics, local and state political environments, and more.

“States aren’t totally off the hook, but what we are seeing is the result of lack of resources and strong guidance (and the historical way in which public health is organized and delivered in the US),” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me this week.

This is the problem that Biden has promised to address. There are various ideas in Biden’s $400 billion Covid-19 proposal, which includes $20 billion for vaccines, and broader plans, but the general gist of the proposals is the federal government is going to do a lot more — from building mass vaccine centers to deploying more staff.

It’s the kind of thing former President Donald Trump’s administration rejected, as it took a leave-it-to-the-states approach to Covid-19 and even characterized more support to states on vaccines as a federal “invasion.”

If Biden’s push for more federal involvement works, the rate of vaccinations could speed up, and more Americans will be able to get their shots sooner — perhaps in the summer instead of (please no) next year.

That could also give us a clearer idea sooner of when, exactly, everyone can get vaccinated.

Health officials say that while the Johnson & Johnson efficacy results are not as high as those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, the two vaccines that have already received emergency use authorizations from the FDA, the new vaccine’s performance is still superb.

“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the press conference last month. The vaccine was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson based in Belgium, together with Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson’s doesn’t require a booster shot, circumventing the two-dose problems posed by its competitors. There’s no need to track people down for their second dose, which means more people could be vaccinated faster. The shots also don’t require deep-cold storage, which means they’re less costly and somewhat easier to distribute.

“It’s a complete game changer,” said Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin. “It completely changes the equation.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also different in another way. It uses an adenovirus vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also less expensive to manufacture than the mRNA platform used for the other vaccines. (It’s estimated to cost around $10 per vaccine dose — roughly half the cost of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.)

Johnson & Johnson has promised enough vaccines for 20 million Americans by the end of March and 100 million Americans by the end of June despite production challenges. It would be a huge boost to the 65 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in the US so far.

So even with an overall efficacy level that’s lower than the two other vaccines on the US market, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could become a major player. It’s the vaccine that “can increase equity,” said Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, particularly “if it’s deployed strategically in nations that are hard to reach and where that would be a particular challenge under a two-dose schedule.” Johnson & Johnson expects to distribute a billion doses of its vaccine worldwide this year.

But as amazing as it is to see several effective Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time, it’s now clear that the technology alone won’t save the day. An orchestra of supply chains, manufacturing, logistics, staff, and public trust needs to harmonize in order to actually get billions of shots into arms around the world and finally draw the pandemic to a close. And we also have other hurdles to overcome: controlling the spread of variants that seem to be threatening the effectiveness of all the vaccines we have.

What we learned about the safety and efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine

Johnson & Johnson launched separate clinical trials testing both a one-dose and a two-dose regimen to see how well these strategies provided long-term protection against Covid-19. The one-dose phase 3 trial arm yielded efficacy results first.

But hints that this vaccine could be safe and effective have been trickling out for months. The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

“You know, we’ve got millions of people who’ve received these vaccines already, which is exciting,” he added. “We’re on our way.”",voxdotcom,"['advisers', 'vector', 'phase', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'world', 'johnson', 'recommend', 'johnsons', 'fda', 'adenovirus', 'unanimously', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-29 16:46:05+00:00,40,"More than 80 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been distributed around the world so far. Only 55 — 55! — have gone to people in low-income countries. In fact, just one country: Guinea.

Those 55 doses in Guinea don’t even represent “the start of a ‘real’ national vaccination rollout,” said Edouard Mathieu, head of data at Oxford University’s Our World in Data, which has been tracking the global vaccine effort. Rather, a few Guinean public officials were vaccinated at the end of December — with the Russian Sputnik V vaccine — on an experimental basis, the Associated Press reported.

“Then nobody was vaccinated after that,” added Mathieu. (The Guinea health ministry has not responded to Vox’s request for comment.) As a result, Our World in Data stopped tracking Guinea’s rollout.

As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, with new, dangerous variants picking up pace, the vaccination campaigns in all the world’s poorest countries haven’t even begun. Meanwhile, wealthy nations already vaccinating have pre-purchased access to supplies that can more than cover their populations — about four times over, in the case of the US, according to a December New York Times analysis.

This doesn’t mean there are “warehouses full of extra vaccine doses” sitting around in high-income countries, explained Andrea Taylor, a Duke University researcher who has been analyzing the deals. But the countries with deals have priority manufacturing slots for 2021, “meaning that even if other countries make purchases now, they may have to wait months or even a year for delivery.”

The result: “High-income countries have 16 percent of the world’s population but currently hold 60 percent of the vaccine doses that have been purchased,” Taylor added.

With this kind of vaccine access, the people in rich countries will start to see their epidemics slow down over the next year, and life may regain some of its pre-pandemic rhythm. People in poor countries, meanwhile, may experience no such benefit. In fact, it will likely take years for many low-income countries to even start fully fledged vaccine campaigns, said Agathe Demarais, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, in a recent briefing. “Most developing countries will not have widespread access to the shots before 2023 at the earliest.”

“That’s not just unconscionable,” said Georgetown global health law professor Lawrence Gostin, “but it also is very much against the interests of high-income countries.”

This greed will help the coronavirus continue to spread globally, allowing more opportunity for variants that resist the vaccines to emerge and Covid-19 outbreaks to reignite, including in rich countries. This is a cycle that repeats with just about every disease threat: Rich countries benefit from new health technology first, while poor countries have to wait years, or decades, for it to trickle to them, as the New Yorker’s Michael Specter wrote. But there are growing calls to break the pattern — and Norway is showing the rest of the world how it can be done.

How rich countries exacerbated the global Covid-19 vaccine scarcity

As of January 27, the majority of the 80.2 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered worldwide have gone to people in only a handful of high- and middle-income countries and regions (namely, the US, China, the EU, the UK, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates).

Several middle-income countries — the poorest among them include India, Myanmar, Ecuador, and Indonesia — have doled out 2.3 million doses in total. Most — 2.03 million — went to people in India.

But the lowest-income countries — for instance, Zambia, Bolivia, Tajikistan, and Nepal — have not begun vaccinating at all.

So why, in this pandemic, are such disparities allowed? It’s pretty simple: Covid-19 vaccines aren’t a public good. Capital rules who gets access first, and those with capital — rich and middle-income countries — have bought first dibs in the vaccine supply, through lucrative pre-purchase agreements with vaccine developers.

“That’s left a global scarcity and also resulted in a bidding war which has made the prices more expensive,” Gostin said. “As a result, [for] countries themselves which are lower income, there aren’t any doses to buy and they are too expensive.”

Because countries inked deals with manufacturers before clinical trials were complete, betting on which companies might come out with vaccines that work, they each signed multiple agreements, covering their populations many times over.

The pre-purchase agreements “made sense in the world we lived in six months ago, because we didn’t yet know which, if any, of the vaccine candidates would come to market,” said Taylor. But the result was that, by November, high-income countries — along with a few middle-income countries — had already pre-purchased the rights to 3.8 billion vaccine doses, with options for another 5 billion, according to an analysis by Taylor and her colleagues at Duke.

Yes, that’s just about as many doses as there are people in the world.

This vaccine hoarding happened in parallel with an unprecedented multilateral effort to support the development and equitable distribution of 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the world’s poorest countries before the end of 2021, called Covax.

The initiative has two parts: a purchasing pool for higher-income countries, and a fundraising effort for poorer countries. By promising to buy a certain number of vaccine doses from manufacturers, countries that join get access to any vaccines that are approved in Covax’s portfolio, while also creating a global market for the shots and driving prices down.

More than 190 countries signed on — including rich ones. But the bilateral deals have undermined Covax. Rich countries “want to have it both ways,” Gostin said. “They join Covax so they could proclaim to be good global citizens, and at the same time rob Covax of its lifeblood, which is vaccine doses.”

How to stop hoarding

In the first quarter of the year, Covax is planning to begin delivering a first batch of 100 million vaccine doses. But vaccine distribution is already lagging in rich countries, where manufacturers have failed to deliver the doses they initially promised, and governments are struggling to set up systems to get millions of people through the door at once.

The emerging disparity has prompted calls for rich countries to stop hoarding vaccines and share their excess supply with poorer countries through Covax. It’s also stirring discussion about how countries and manufacturers can get creative and bolster supplies for the world.

Right now, “the biggest constraint for everyone to get vaccinated is the number of doses,” Nicholas Lusiani, at Oxfam America, told Vox. Instead of fighting over the crumbs, he said, Oxfam has suggested countries build regional vaccine production hubs to churn out vaccines at a lower price in the places they’re needed (and where production costs are lower).

The US, Europe, and other high-income countries could also push companies with effective vaccines to collaborate with other manufacturers on production, sharing their technology, or even waiving intellectual property rights. (AstraZeneca has already done so, sharing information with the Serum Institute in India.)

Then there’s simple donating of vaccines. Gostin and colleagues have called on the US to work with other high-income countries and inoculate only their most vulnerable groups — health workers, older adults — first, then give the excess supply to Covax, which could distribute vaccines to high-risk groups in the rest of the world.

“There’s a certain ethical and political justification for putting your own country first because every government’s first duty is to its own population,” Gostin said. “But that’s to a point.”

Still, Taylor said, “it is complex and there is no easy solution. ... It would be a very hard sell for the leader of a rich country to start donating doses to other countries while still vaccinating their own population — this is what needs to happen, but it is hard to imagine.”

Norway has managed to do it. Much like the US, the Nordic country will have access to three times as many vaccines as it needs. “This allows us to redistribute vaccines to other countries,” said Norway’s minister of international development, Dag-Inge Ulstein. “The distribution will be started gradually and in parallel to the current vaccination of the Norwegian population as soon as relevant vaccines are approved.”

The Norwegian government decided it was both ethical and self-interested to ensure people in low-income countries can access effective vaccines as soon as possible. “Otherwise,” Ulstein added, “it will be a long time before these countries are able to vaccinate a sufficiently large proportion of their populations. [And] that would not benefit anyone.” Now it’s time for other countries to follow suit.",voxdotcom,"['rich', 'global', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'access', 'doses', 'hoarding', 'highincome', 'countries', 'world', 'vaccines']",0

The next step is for the FDA to accept the recommendation, which could happen as soon as this weekend, clearing the way for distribution.

Earlier this week, the FDA posted a briefing going over the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which included 40,000 participants in several countries divided randomly into placebo and treatment groups.

The most important finding: The vaccine was 100 percent effective after 28 days at preventing deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 among the clinical trial participants who received the treatment. (Two vaccine recipients were hospitalized with Covid-19 two weeks after receiving the injection.)

The vaccine was also 66.1 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness after four weeks, with consistent results across all age groups. When looking at blocking severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.4 percent effective.

Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, said during a press conference last month that the vaccine also had “plain vanilla safety results,” with the vast majority of recipients experiencing no problems.

The company published some of its early phase 1 and phase 2 trial data in a preprint paper in September, and the final version of the paper in January, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The papers showed the vaccine was well tolerated among the participants, and seemingly very effective: With one dose, after 29 days, the vaccine ensured that 90 percent of participants had enough antibodies required to neutralize the virus. After 57 days, that number reached 100 percent.

“When I looked at that, I thought, wow, this Johnson & Johnson product is very powerful after the first dose in terms of immunogenicity,” said Monica Gandhi, a professor of global medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines needed two doses to get that level of [virus] neutralization.”

Like Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson “didn’t rush to phase 3 [trials],” said Hilda Bastian, a scientist who has been tracking the global vaccine race. Instead, it tested multiple vaccine doses and candidates at the outset to figure out which might perform the best in humans, and then proceeded through clinical trials.

The vaccine was also tested in nine countries — the largest single international phase 3 trial in the world, with more than 60,000 participants — meaning many ethnic groups were represented in the data, Bastian said. “As if all that’s not enough, it’s one of the ones that could be manufactured in South Africa and other places,” since Johnson & Johnson has manufacturing capacity around the world, even in countries hard-hit by the pandemic that have been waiting for vaccine supplies, she added.

The day this vaccine gets approval “is going to be a big day for the future of this pandemic [and] a ticket out of this disease for a larger part of the world,” said Nicholas Lusiani, a senior adviser at Oxfam America.

How adenovirus vector vaccines work

Part of the appeal of this vaccine lies in the technology behind it. Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including the common cold. They’re very efficient at getting their DNA into a cell’s nucleus. Scientists reasoned that if they could snip out the right sections of an adenovirus’s genome and insert another piece of DNA code (in this case, for a fragment of the new coronavirus), they could have a powerful system to deliver instructions to cells.

For decades, scientists have experimented with adenovirus vectors as a platform for gene therapy and to treat certain cancers, using the virus to modify or replace genes in host cells. More recently, researchers have found success using adenoviruses as vaccines. Already, an adenovirus vector vaccine has been developed for the Ebola virus.

In addition to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, CanSino Biologics of China is also developing an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine; Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses this platform, too.

To make one of these vaccines, the adenovirus is modified so that it can’t reproduce but can carry the instructions for making a component of a virus. In the case of Covid-19, most adenovirus vector vaccines code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the part the virus uses to begin an infection.

Human cells then read those instructions delivered by the adenovirus and begin manufacturing the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike proteins as a threat and begins to build up its defenses.

Since adenoviruses exist naturally, they tend to be more temperature-stable than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles that are used to deliver the mRNA in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

“The nice thing about the adenovirus vector vaccines is that they’re a little more tolerant to a longer shelf life, to the conditions of storage,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University. Adenovirus vector vaccines can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while mRNA vaccines need freezers, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine requiring temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius.

This helps lower the cost and complexity of manufacturing, distribution, and administration of adenovirus vector vaccines compared to other platforms. And simply having another vaccine on the market, made by a major pharmaceutical company with its own manufacturing infrastructure, is a big step forward. “The more vaccine doses we can have, the better,” Rasmussen said.

What comes next

The next challenge for Johnson & Johnson, after getting a green light from the FDA, is actually delivering doses to millions of arms.

But with three vaccines eventually on the market, should people hold out for any one vaccine in particular?

“Right now when people ask me, which, you know, which vaccine should I get? It’s pretty easy to answer that question because it’s whichever one you get offered,” said Paul Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Vaccine supplies are limited, the transmission of the virus is high, and hospitals are close to capacity, so few people can be picky about what they get.

On the other hand, once vaccine supplies stabilize, having multiple vaccines with different characteristics could allow doctors and public health officials to optimize how the shots are distributed. “If the efficacy [of a given vaccine] is lower but still pretty good, there may be a scenario that one vaccine is recommended for low-risk populations and another one is for a high-risk population,” Omer said.

Though the Johnson & Johnson vaccine does have some key advantages over its competitors, it could face some of the same distribution snags that have hit other vaccines, like miscommunication between the government and hospitals, and production hurdles.

Researchers say that all the manufacturers also need to start working to get vaccines to the rest of the world. The new variants that have emerged in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa and have been detected in other parts of the world are reminders that the virus continues to evolve, and that a partially vaccinated population could exert more selection pressures that accelerate these mutations. So vaccination has to happen fast, and globally — and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may be a critical tool to do this.

“Long term, we need to be thinking about getting vaccines out equitably to the entire world, and having vaccines that are easier to distribute in terms of the cold chain requirements is going to be huge in that regard,” Rasmussen said.

But even as these vaccines roll out, there’s still more to learn: how long protection from vaccines last, whether there are any rare complications to consider, whether they prevent transmission as well as disease, and how well these vaccines work against the new variants. There are already some troubling signs of how these variants might eventually be able to evade vaccines. Continuing clinical trials will be critical, Sax said.

“You know, we’ve got millions of people who’ve received these vaccines already, which is exciting,” he added. “We’re on our way.”",voxdotcom,"['advisers', 'vector', 'phase', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'world', 'johnson', 'recommend', 'johnsons', 'fda', 'adenovirus', 'unanimously', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-29 13:30:05+00:00,7,"President Joe Biden wants to work with congressional Republicans. He also wants to pass a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package. He might have to choose between the two.

Senate Republicans have made clear they don’t support the proposal Biden rolled out last week, which included $1,400 stimulus checks to people making less than $75,000 annually (or a couple earning less than $150,000 annually), $400-per-week supplemental unemployment insurance through September, hundreds of millions for sped-up vaccine deployment and to reopen schools, and a $15 minimum wage.

Republicans are open to a more targeted (read: smaller) relief bill. They are eager to funnel money toward Covid-19 vaccine distribution and there is some support for a more targeted version of stimulus checks, but that’s about as far as they’ll go. Many also say they want to ensure the $900 billion Covid-19 relief package Congress already passed in December is spent before they appropriate more money.

“The size of the package is a big question,” moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins (ME) recently told reporters. She said the “package should focus solely on the persistent pandemic. It should not be used as a vehicle for a wish list that certain Democrats have,” an overt reference to the minimum wage hike.

Collins represents a handful of GOP senators who might be more likely to strike a deal with Biden’s administration. She’s part of a bipartisan group of senators with a direct line of communication to the White House. Their ranks have grown, but the group still includes just eight Republicans — two shy of the number needed to advance any bill past the Senate filibuster. And the early skepticism of even moderate Republicans is making Democrats urge Biden not to take too long before considering other options to pass Covid-19 relief.

“Our preference is to make this important work bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and revisions from our Republican colleagues,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on Thursday. “But if our Republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them.”

The White House has insisted that hammering out a bipartisan deal is its first priority, and Biden’s senior staff are busy reaching out to lawmakers. But behind the scenes, House and Senate Democrats are preparing budget reconciliation bills to pass Covid-19 relief — a sign they’re not willing to wait too long before moving ahead without Republicans.

“Tell me the Republicans we have on board right now,” said an incredulous Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who now chairs the Senate Budget Committee and has purview over reconciliation. “I’ve not heard one Republican.”

The clock is ticking for Biden to strike a bipartisan deal, and some Democrats are already growing impatient. Schumer said the Senate would move ahead with a Covid-19 relief bill “as soon as next week.”

The White House is primarily negotiating with a bipartisan group of senators

The bulk of White House talks on Biden’s Covid-19 relief bill have rested with a bipartisan group of senators.

“I prefer these things to be bipartisan because I’m trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the, how can I say it, the vitriol out of all of this,” Biden recently told reporters.

The group of eight Democrats and eight Republicans includes Republican Sens. Collins, Lisa Murkowski (AK), Mitt Romney (UT), Bill Cassidy (LA), Rob Portman (OH), Jerry Moran (KS), Shelly Moore Capito (WV), and Todd Young (IN), and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (WV), Mark Warner (VA), Dick Durbin (IL), Jeanne Shaheen (NH), Maggie Hassan (NH), Angus King (ME), John Hickenlooper (CO), and Mark Kelly (AZ).

Senators told Vox the group has the potential to grow further, but it still does not have the 10 Republican votes needed to skirt past the filibuster. Even if they did have the numbers, sources familiar with the coalition told Vox the group is meant to be more informal and spur discussions among senators, rather than whipping votes.

Biden White House officials have been doing a lot of outreach to lawmakers in both parties. Senior officials including National Economic Council director Brian Deese and White House Covid czar Jeff Zients held a Sunday call with the bipartisan Senate group to go over their plan before following up again this week.

“It was quite a useful and productive opportunity to provide that further justification” for Biden’s plan, one White House official said, adding the Sunday phone call was “one of literally dozens of conversations that senior administration officials have had with members of Congress from both parties over the last week.”

Some of the senators on the Sunday call told White House officials they wanted to see changes like targeting stimulus checks to needier families, and stripping some more progressive provisions like a $15 minimum wage from the final bill text. Biden seems open to negotiate, saying he sees the current income thresholds dictating who is eligible for proposed $1,400 stimulus payments as a moving target.

“I give the administration a lot of credit for listening, and I think even today we’ve heard the president say that maybe we can look at targeting the economic impact payments a little bit,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) told Vox. “I know the president believes in bipartisanship, but we have an urgent need here. We need to make sure we express our concerns, fine-tune this as best we can, but ... we need to come together quickly and make some good compromises.”

In the coming weeks, it’s largely a question of how much Biden’s White House is willing to give. Just targeting stimulus checks isn’t the only thing Republicans want to see the White House give on. Indeed, the Senate GOP thinks large chunks of Biden’s plan aren’t necessary.

“I’m sure they’d be very happy to work with us if we agreed with everything they proposed,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) told Vox. “How willing they are to work with us if we have ideas about taking this apart and having perhaps two pieces of legislation, or perhaps adjusting certain elements, that’s something they would have to respond to.”

So far, the White House has unequivocally pushed back on the idea of splitting Biden’s plan into two separate bills.

“We are not looking to split the package, that is not a proposal from the White House,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Biden believes his $1.9 trillion package is already appropriately targeted to people who need it most, but “he’s happy to have a conversation about any component.”

Still, Biden’s White House might have to bring down their plan’s price tag for Republicans — and even some moderate Democrats — to support it.

Democrats don’t want to wait too long before using budget reconciliation

Democratic leaders have a backup plan if bipartisan talks fail: Budget reconciliation.

“We ought to try to do what we can do in a bipartisan way. Let’s do that first — show them that we can start out the new Congress bipartisan,” Manchin told reporters recently, adding, “And what we don’t agree on in a bipartisan way, then Senator Schumer and the leadership and the Democrat Party has other means to move things along, and I think it’s appropriate.”

Manchin is talking about budget reconciliation, which is the mechanism that allows Democrats to attach big items to budget bills — which they can pass with 51 votes.

“We can get a lot of the Covid bill done with reconciliation,” Schumer recently told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. “And that’s something we certainly will use if they try to block this immediate Covid bill.”

While Republicans in the bipartisan group are the ones advocating for cutting back on Biden’s Covid-19 bill, Democratic senators in the centrist group haven’t been as eager to scale back. Democrats remember that Senate Republicans used the budget reconciliation mechanism to pass their massive tax cut bill in 2017, and some in the Democratic caucus think they should give their priorities the same treatment now that they hold the majority.

Sanders, the Senate Budget Committee chair, and House Budget Committee Chair John Yarmuth have each told reporters their committees are working on drafting budget reconciliation resolutions for the Covid-19 relief bill, which could pass in a matter of days if Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi give them the green light.

“I hope my Republican colleagues come on board,” Sanders told reporters on Wednesday. “But if not, we’re going forward.”",voxdotcom,"['big', 'bill', 'group', 'white', 'senate', 'work', 'covid19', 'promise', 'test', 'republicans', 'bidens', 'getting', 'house', 'budget', 'told', 'bipartisan']",0
2021-01-29 02:20:48+00:00,45,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0
2021-01-28 22:34:08+00:00,20,"When the city of Philadelphia announced its “unique public/private partnership” to create a mass vaccination clinic with an upstart nonprofit called Philly Fighting COVID in early January, it seemed like an objectively good thing. The clinic could vaccinate thousands of people per day, and Philly Fighting COVID’s website allowed not-yet-eligible Philadelphians to preregister for vaccines by supplying their name, birthday, address, and occupation — which the city encouraged residents to do because it hadn’t made a preregistration site of its own.

It’s not looking so good now. Philadelphia ended the partnership after it was reported that the company changed its nonprofit status to for profit, and its privacy policy to say that it could sell the preregistration data its site collected (Philly Fighting COVID maintains that it had no intentions to sell data and didn’t even realize that language was in its privacy policy). Now, the city is scrambling to reassure residents that their data won’t be sold and to reschedule their vaccine appointments with other providers. Philadelphia’s district attorney and Pennsylvania’s attorney general are threatening to launch investigations. A clinic nurse has accused Philly Fighting COVID’s CEO of taking unused vaccines from the clinic.

The Philly Fighting COVID debacle is a cautionary tale about the importance of properly vetting health vendors. It’s also a cautionary tale about the importance (and lack) of privacy protections for sensitive health data during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Across the country, we are seeing governments and their private contractors collecting lots of our Covid-related data, often with insufficient privacy safeguards,” Electronic Frontier Foundation senior staff attorney Adam Schwartz told Recode. “This is bad for public health efforts, which depend on public trust. More must be done to secure our private information.”

Now Democrats in both houses of Congress are trying to pass better health privacy laws that could both prevent what happened in Philadelphia from happening again and reassure the public that their sensitive health information stays private.

Sens. Richard Blumenthal (CT) and Mark Warner (VA) and Reps. Suzan DelBene (WA), Anna Eshoo (CA), and Jan Schakowsky (IL) announced their Public Health Emergency Privacy Act on Thursday. Among other things, the bill would prohibit the use of health data for anything but public health — it couldn’t be used to sell ads, or given to other (unrelated) government agencies. And tech companies would have to take certain measures to keep user data secure and delete it once the pandemic is over.

“Technology has become one of our greatest tools in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic but we need to build trust with the broader public if we are going to reach its full potential,” DelBene said in a statement. “Americans need to be certain their sensitive personal information will be protected when using tracing apps and other Covid-19 response technology and this pandemic-specific privacy legislation will help build that trust.”

Privacy advocates have long sounded the alarm over how the pandemic response may erode civil liberties, including health privacy. Over the last year, many government agencies have touted public-private partnerships to facilitate contact tracing, testing, data collection, and now, vaccine distribution. Private companies have stepped up to do what public health authorities didn’t have the resources to do themselves. But these efforts have had mixed results, and come with privacy issues that threaten to undermine public trust — and public health.

Verily, the life sciences company owned by Alphabet, created an online platform in March for people to sign up for tests and receive their results. But users needed a Google account to use the portal, and they had to supply personal information (Google is also owned by Alphabet). California’s San Francisco and Alameda counties ended the program in October over accessibility and data privacy concerns, noting that some people didn’t want to give their information to Google, even though the company said their data wouldn’t be shared without their consent.

In April, North Dakota became the first state to use digital contact tracing with its Care19 app. A month later, a privacy software company discovered that the app sent data to Foursquare via an SDK (Foursquare told the Washington Post that it discarded any data received from the app). Adoption of digital contact tracing has remained slow in America, partially because of privacy concerns.

And in Florida, some counties resorted to using Eventbrite to schedule vaccine appointments after their own registration sites failed or weren’t ready in time. That’s arguably better than not having a vaccine registration system at all — some counties forced people to wait for hours in first-come, first-serve lines — but Eventbrite doesn’t appear to have any special protections for data for vaccine registrants (the company did not answer questions from Recode regarding its handling of vaccine registration data).

Again, there’s no evidence that these companies sold or misused health data in these cases. The issue is that there isn’t much to stop them from doing so. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which dates back to 1996, doesn’t cover a lot of data that many of us consider being health-related, nor does it cover many of the health-related services we now use. And in some cases where data would be protected, the government has granted special exceptions to HIPAA compliance requirements. Meanwhile, we’re relying more than ever on private companies to assist with the pandemic because public health authorities were woefully underprepared, understaffed, and under-resourced to do it themselves.

“Technologies like contact tracing, home testing, and online appointment booking are absolutely essential to stop the spread of this disease, but Americans are rightly skeptical that their sensitive health data will be kept safe and secure,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “Legal safeguards protecting consumer privacy failed to keep pace with technology, and that lapse is costing us in the fight against Covid-19.”

If people don’t trust that their health data will be protected, they may be more reluctant to seek out treatment — that includes getting a vaccine that many are already wary of, and which requires widespread adoption to achieve herd immunity. Better health privacy laws might reassure the public that their health data will be kept safe. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much interest in passing those laws. Last year, Republicans and Democrats in both houses of Congress proposed pandemic-related health privacy bills. None of them went anywhere, and they joined an ever-growing stack of failed privacy laws.

2021-01-28 06:45:05+00:00,10,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-01-27 23:30:45+00:00,16,"A new executive action from President Joe Biden takes direct aim at the racism former President Donald Trump stoked toward Asian Americans, marking a stark break from the discriminatory efforts of the previous administration.

As part of a broader package of memorandums advancing racial equity, Biden signed one executive action Tuesday in which he condemned xenophobic language that’s been used related to the pandemic and called on the Justice Department to collect data on hate crimes and harassment directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).

Since last spring, there have been more than 2,500 self-reported cases of anti-Asian hate incidents, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a group that’s been tracking these reports. Trump himself played a role in fueling hostility toward AAPI people by repeatedly referring to Covid-19 as the “China virus” and even calling it the “kung flu” at times. He has previously argued that this approach was intended to capture the virus’s place of origin, even though it runs directly counter to guidance from the World Health Organization.

In its recommendations, the WHO has urged people to refrain from tying viruses to specific locations because it could stigmatize those places and people who are associated with them. Per Stop AAPI Hate, an increase in hate incident reports corresponded with the surge in the severity of the pandemic as well as Trump’s use of such language last year. Since then, AAPI have reported being physically attacked, spat on, and verbally assaulted regarding their supposed ties to the virus.

Like a few of the executive orders Biden has signed since taking office, Tuesday’s is largely a symbolic statement about who America is, with some substantive action meant to start addressing the issue. As part of the memo, Biden effectively calls on government agencies to remove the use of such language in official documents, if they find it.

“The particular xenophobia propagated by the previous administration … must be addressed,” a senior administration official said on a press call discussing the executive actions Biden is taking to advance racial equity. Other actions he’s signed include measures to combat housing discrimination and to end the federal use of private prisons.

This memo marks a notable step in denouncing Trump’s racist actions and the specific challenges that members of the AAPI community have faced during the pandemic, though experts hope it’s a signal of more to come.

When it comes to the pandemic response, for example, there’s more the administration could do to gather data broken out by ethnic group, in order to address disparities within the AAPI community. For instance, Filipino American nurses have made up a disproportionate number of the deaths that have resulted from Covid-19 — an issue that may be obscured by sweeping data that treats AAPI people as a monolith. (Other executive actions Biden has taken set up task forces aimed at tackling this issue, and advocates are keeping a close eye on what they achieve.)

“This is an important first step,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at UC Riverside and the head of AAPI Data. “When you’re talking about issues that range from unemployment to health outcomes to education barriers, having more nuanced data about our community is important because the averages mask extreme disparities.”

What the executive memo would do

The executive memo takes a clear stand in disavowing anti-Asian bias and discrimination, while also directing agencies to take steps that are intended to help improve health care access and target harassment. Specifically, it includes the following guidance:

The measure urges federal agencies to ensure that their documents aren’t promoting racism: It presses agencies to make sure that documents and statements “do not exhibit or contribute to racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.” In effect, it asks federal bodies to remove any use of terms popularized by Trump, like “China virus,” from official communications.

It presses agencies to make sure that documents and statements “do not exhibit or contribute to racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.” In effect, it asks federal bodies to remove any use of terms popularized by Trump, like “China virus,” from official communications. The memo directs the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance about the federal government’s Covid-19 response to make sure it is accessible and not discriminatory: It calls on HHS to work with the Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide guidance about how to offer public health information in more languages, and to ensure that it’s not promoting biases.

It calls on HHS to work with the Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force to provide guidance about how to offer public health information in more languages, and to ensure that it’s not promoting biases. The memo also directs the Department of Justice to work on combating anti-Asian harassment and to collect data on it: It pushes the DOJ to collaborate with leaders in AAPI communities to combat harassment and hate crimes, and to support states’ efforts to do the same, when possible. It also directs the attorney general to set up a data collection system to track these incidents and provide public reports, something the DOJ had yet to do up to this point. This policy is similar to an initiative that the DOJ established after 9/11 in order to track harassment and hate crimes against Muslim Americans, Sikhs, and people of Arab and South Asian descent.

Advocates want to see more — including data disaggregation

Advocates see the administration’s memo as important to addressing inequities that AAPI people have faced, but they’d also like to see additional commitments — including more data related to the pandemic that’s broken out by ethnic group. Implementing this practice, which is known as data disaggregation, could help highlight the unique challenges that various groups in the community are navigating: Broad data about AAPI people often doesn’t capture specific issues that different ethnic groups are dealing with. (Biden has backed more coordinated efforts on this subject as part of his executive actions — but it’s not yet clear how the administration’s task forces will approach the topic.)

“What I don’t see here is ensuring that we have a full picture of the Asian American community — specifically recognizing that the Pacific Islander community has different challenges that they’ve faced,” says John Yang, the executive director of the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice. During the pandemic, Pacific Islanders in particular have seen higher Covid-19 fatality rates compared to other groups within AAPI communities, and better data would help lawmakers target testing, vaccines, and other health care support.

As Rachel Ramirez reported for Vox, you can see the importance of disaggregating the data in a state like Oregon, which has collected data specifically focusing on Pacific Islanders. “The CDC, like other government agencies, tend to aggregate Pacific Islander under the Asian demographic, which harmfully hides the high infection and death rates within the community,” she writes. The pattern that was found in Oregon prompted nonprofit groups to direct more Covid-19 resources to the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community in the state, though the government’s response was lackluster, Ramirez notes.

Many AAPI advocates emphasized that more information is needed at the federal level to examine the pandemic’s effects. “We ... want to see his administration take further steps to address the systemic racism that results in disproportionate rates of illness and death among Pacific Islanders and South Asians and pushes health care out of reach for immigrants,” Sung Yeon Choimorrow, the executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said.

Stop AAPI Hate, too, has issued a list of policy priorities it would like the administration to consider, including an effort directing the attorney general to initiate civil actions for anti-Asian incidents, a push that would shift the onus of bringing these legal challenges from victims to the federal government.

The Biden administration said this week that the executive actions taken so far are intended to establish a foundation it aims to keep building on. “This is not the end of our work on racial equity on day six,” an administration official said during the press call.",voxdotcom,"['pacific', 'hate', 'memo', 'biden', 'condemned', 'americans', 'community', 'aapi', 'health', 'executive', 'start', 'racism', 'data', 'asian']",0

2021-01-27 17:10:03+00:00,9,"Since the start of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been mutating, its genetic code slowly changing as it spreads from person to person across the globe. For most of that time, the mutations didn’t concern scientists. The genetic changes didn’t seem meaningful in terms of how dangerous the virus is. Mutations are normal. Some even weaken the virus.

Now, things are different.

There are three mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 of particular concern around the world. Researchers do not have the same level of evidence for each: One is more well understood than the others. But in each case, researchers see a seed of something concerning.

There’s B.1.1.7 (yes, all these variants are clunkily named). This variant was first detected in the UK in September. Scientists strongly suspect it’s more transmissible (i.e., contagious) than past versions of SARS-CoV-2, and there’s some preliminary evidence that it might be slightly more deadly.

Then there’s a pair of variants — one discovered in South Africa in October, and another in Brazil in December — that are less well understood. But scientists are beginning to suspect that they might have evolved ways to evade the human immune system, at least a little bit.

A reasonable question you might be asking: Why now? Why have these three variants of concern popped up in such quick succession? The fact that the virus is mutating isn’t new. It’s been mutating all along.

“We’ve had many, many variants in SARS-CoV-2 for a long time now, and scientists have even been tracking these in fairly detailed ways since the summer of 2020,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern, says. “The big difference is that, before December, we hadn’t really seen any variants that seemed to be behaving any differently.” (By “behaving differently” she means that the virus itself didn’t seem at the time to be more infectious, or more dangerous in any intrinsic way.)

Hodcroft and others who study the evolution of viruses provide a few overlapping answers to the question “Why now?” None of them perfectly explain what’s going on.

But thinking through them brings us to another, perhaps even more critical question: How might the coronavirus continue to evolve? Will even more variants emerge that challenge our fight against the virus? And what does that mean for the pandemic?

Overall, experts outlined four reasons we’re seeing these variants now. And it all boils down to one thing: evolution.

Reason 1: The virus’s genetic diversity increases over time

First off, it’s helpful to get a refresher on how evolution works. At its core, evolution requires two things: individual differences and natural selection. Evolution is a nonstop process. Organisms — as a group — accumulate change over time through mutations, and the environment helps determine which changes stick around in a population, and which become less prevalent.

Viruses mutate because they’re constantly making copies of themselves in enormous numbers. If you were writing a draft of something millions of times on a computer, extremely quickly, you’d probably make some typos. This has happened millions and billions of times across the globe. The longer the pandemic rages on, the more chances the virus has to evolve.

In the beginning of the pandemic, the viruses infecting people were really similar to one another, because they weren’t that far removed from the original virus that began the outbreak. But now the virus has been changing genetically over the past year, branching out like a family tree. So many genetic changes have accumulated, in different places.

“We have no evidence that the underlying mutation rate is changing,” Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist who studies viral evolution at the University of Chicago, says. The virus is still making its typos at the same rate. It’s just that those changes start to accumulate the longer the pandemic continues. If you kept copying a book, over and over, making typos in each copy, you’d end up with a somewhat different book than you started with. Likewise, according to Cobey, you’d expect the genetic diversity of the virus to increase over time.

So that’s one major part of it. The virus has just had a lot of opportunities to become something slightly different.

But that’s not all of it. The increased diversity doesn’t quite explain why we’re seeing these particular — seemingly more concerning — variants at this particular time. “We are seeing evidence of adaptive evolution,” Cobey says. These variants appear to be either getting better at infecting people or possibly evading the immune system, and they are doing so in similar ways.

Genetic diversity alone doesn’t explain that. Natural selection does.

Reason 2: It’s possible the virus is evolving in response to increasing human immunity

The virus’s increasing genetic diversity only explains part of the story. The other part of the story: natural selection.

Some of the virus’s genetic changes provide an advantage, which has led, in some cases, to these variants outperforming older strains of the virus. “Some of those [genetic] substitutions are actually helping the virus replicate better,” Cobey says, which then can lead to the variants infecting an increasingly larger proportion of people compared to other variants.

Both the P.1 variant found in Brazil and the 501Y.V2 variant found in South Africa have a mutation called E484K, which changes the part of the virus that attaches to human cells (it’s also the part that the immune system most readily recognizes after someone is vaccinated). That mutation, Hodcroft says, “might allow reinfection.” In other words, people who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be a little bit more susceptible to these variants (though this is still not confirmed).

Hodcroft suspects that both the P.1 and 501Y.V2 variants may have evolved in response to human immunity. And she stresses: What follows is mostly speculative at this point.

In the beginning of the pandemic, no human had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before. That means everybody’s immune systems were equally bad at recognizing the virus. If there had been a variant that was good at evading the human immune system, it wouldn’t have risen to prominence because it wouldn’t have outperformed its viral peers.

As Hodcroft explains it: “Even if this [E484K] mutation popped up — which we know it did, we can see that it popped up a few times — it might not have been in a place where this was an advantage.”

In many places around the world, there are lots of people who have already been infected and who have developed some level of immunity to the virus.

So now, variants that can evade the immune system have an advantage. They could grow and replicate where other variants cannot. And that variant could quickly become the dominant one.

“I want to be really clear: We aren’t 100 percent sure, scientifically, that this is what’s happened,” Hodcroft says. “But these are the kinds of things to think about when we think about why we might be seeing different variants now. We’ve changed the rules of the game.”

Reason 3: The virus has spread so far that rare things are starting to happen

The longer the pandemic goes on, the more chances there are for rare — and sometimes consequential — things to happen.

The B.1.1.7 variant might be one of these consequences. It appears to have acquired significant genetic changes over a short period — so many that scientists suspect the variant might have emerged in an immunocompromised person.

In most people, Hodcroft explains, the immune system mounts a full-on assault on the virus, eliminating it in a couple of weeks. “In people that have compromised immune systems, though, there’s a very different dynamic,” she says. “So, for one thing, the virus could be in them for months instead of weeks.” That gives the virus more time to evolve, to accumulate mutations that might make it easier to thwart the immune system.

Many things have to happen for this to occur. Not only does an immunocompromised person have to get the virus (and many immunocompromised people are being particularly cautious), the virus would have to acquire mutations, and then the immunocompromised person would have to spread the virus to another person.

“These are all like ‘super-edge cases,’” Hodcroft says. But “by keeping cases so high, you increase the chance that sooner or later, you’re going to hit that jackpot ... we keep rolling the die when we keep the cases up so high.”

Reason 4: Some Covid-19 treatments might have instigated some evolution

The rise of these variants “may have something to do with the use of convalescent plasma,” says Michael Worobey, the head of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.

Convalescent plasma treatments are blood plasma transfusions from people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2. The idea is that along with the transfusion come antibodies that can help someone else with Covid-19 fight off the disease. The problem is that within certain recipients, the plasma could conceivably also create an environment that favors a stronger variant of the virus.

“So there are cases where the identical [mutations] that characterize the UK variant have also evolved in patients who are chronically infected with the virus and were then given convalescent plasma,” Worobey says. “It’s a perfect storm.” The virus has built up genetic diversity in the patient, and then the convalescent plasma acts as a force of natural selection, choosing among those variants one that could evade antibodies in that plasma.

Worobey is not saying that this definitely happened with the B.1.1.7 variant, just that it’s possible. (A similar thing, he says, could have happened with using monoclonal antibodies — synthetic antibodies produced as a Covid-19 treatment — on immunocompromised patients.)

It’s not that these treatments never should have been used. In many cases, they may have helped save lives when there are few treatment options for Covid-19. But in the case of using convalescent plasma on immunocompromised people, Worobey says, it may have been “a bit irresponsible.”

The virus will keep evolving. Vaccinations need to happen quickly, and cases need to decrease.

The virus will keep changing, and there will be more variants. Not all will be variants of concern, though.

“I think one thing that we definitely have to keep in mind, particularly in the next few weeks and months, is that a lot of people are now very interested in doing [viral genetic] sequencing and looking for variants,” Hodcroft says. “And that’s fantastic. This is exactly what I’ve been kind of begging for for a long time — for more countries to really dedicate resources to this.” But with the increased vigilance, she says, “we’re going to see a lot of false alarm variants.”

But there also might be more variants of concern in the near future, as the virus is about to get hit by another big selection pressure: vaccines.

“What we don’t want is for there to be high levels of virus circulating and spending a lot of time with a partially vaccinated population”

If, due to random mutations, there’s a strain of the virus that is just a little bit better at evading the immunity provided by vaccines, it could spread.

That’s why these viral evolution experts want vaccination to happen as fast as possible. Just as partial immunity in a single immunocompromised person can act as a selection pressure for evolution, partial immunity in the population at large can as well.

“What we don’t want is for there to be high levels of virus circulating and spending a lot of time with a partially vaccinated population,” Hodcroft says. “We want to keep case numbers while we’re vaccinating as low as we can.”

That’s because “once you vaccinate hundreds of millions of people, the virus is going to be under really quite intense pressure to evolve [immune] escape variants,” Worobey says. Some of these variants, he warns, “may already be in existence” among the public but have not yet been detected — or may soon form as the pandemic continues. “And those variants, I think, we can expect to sweep up to much higher frequency once vaccination provides this huge selective force.”

Evolution happens when there’s a lot of genetic diversity, which then meets a selection pressure. This is what’s happening as the pandemic continues during a vaccination campaign.

The good news is that, for now, it appears the existing vaccines will still be broadly effective against the variants, and that it’s possible to update the vaccines to account for future changes. But how can we stop more viral evolution from happening in the first place?

“The best way to avoid it is to go back in time and not allow the pandemic to spin so out of control,” Worobey says. “If we had done that, and then vaccinated, then we would have been in a much less dangerous situation.”",voxdotcom,"['reasons', 'sarscov2', 'worrying', 'virus', 'evolution', 'coronavirus', 'genetic', 'variant', 'changes', 'hodcroft', 'variants', 'seeing', 'pandemic', 'immune']",0
2021-01-27 13:30:07+00:00,20,"On December 31, a group of gay men intended to celebrate the passing of another year with a cruise in the open ocean, just off the coast of Puerto Vallarta. That day, the ocean had other plans.

From dry land, I saw the videos first on Twitter — men in life jackets and speedos pulling other men in life jackets and speedos onto rescue boats. Local news site Out and About PV confirmed that a boat had sunk, reporting that all partiers were rescued without harm. And then the now-infamous Instagram account “GaysOverCovid” made it go viral.

Over the last few months and peaking in the days surrounding New Year’s Eve, @GaysOverCovid has exponentially multiplied its follower count on Instagram to more than 133,000 since being created in July. The secret to the growing follower count — perhaps not the name, which doesn’t really roll off the tongue — is shame.

GaysOverCovid (GOC) and the many copycat accounts like it repost social media content from people violating coronavirus guidelines by throwing parties, traveling, and attending huge gatherings. In GOC’s case, the violators happen to be predominantly white gay men, including influencers with thousands of their own followers, who are going to massive, maskless parties. (These events, known generally and even pre-Covid as circuit parties, are worth their own separate article.) Don’t be like the “gays over covid,” the account warns, or you might end up being made an example of.

The outing of those who blatantly flout health guidelines and put others in danger can feel satisfying. When massive parties are shut down — or when, by a twist of fate, the ocean decides to swallow a boatful of unmasked partiers — it may look a lot like justice. (Fortunately, in Puerto Vallarta, no one on the capsized boat was reported injured.)

But the rise of GOC’s popularity has driven another conversation about whether schadenfreude does any good at all. Big public health initiatives to curb drunk driving and secondhand smoke rely on shame, but those concerns aren’t quite the same as the coronavirus pandemic. And if you ask public health experts, as satisfying as chastening others can feel, they’ve learned it can actually do harm when it comes to an urgent public health crisis.

Why shaming someone feels like the right thing to do

The primary appeal of GOC’s account, to me, was the lack of self-awareness of some of its subjects. Wanting to go to a party after spending the last 10 months inside is normal. Wanting to hang out with strangers is normal. Wanting to travel to a different country again is normal. What’s baffling isn’t even that people would break all these rules (please don’t), but rather that they would post about it on social media. All the more confusing if they were, as some of the GOC subjects are, health professionals or had major social media followings and paid sponsorships.

The desire to post your foolishness on social media is sadly common. But in talking to public health experts and public health behavioral specialists, the desire to shame people is pretty common too. Shame is one of the tools we use to establish boundaries, and those boundaries establish the structure and behavior that we, as a civil society, approve of and disapprove of.

“Punishment and shaming are some of the strongest and most powerful ways to try to get people back in line”

David Abrams, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at NYU who studies addiction, said that we first see boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable behavior in childhood. As kids, we learned things like washing our hands, or sharing toys, or doing our homework before we watch television. When we broke rules, we were shamed.

“Punishment and shaming, I think, [are some of] the strongest and most powerful ways to try to get people back in line when they deviate,” Abrams told me.

Shaming and embarrassing people on social media is essentially replicating what we’ve been taught to do when we see bad behavior; it’s an attempt to get said behavior back in line. Ridicule is, in its way, setting a boundary; in this case the boundary it’s attempting to impart is “you shouldn’t travel internationally to party and frolic with a bunch of people in a place where hospitals are at their capacity and then return home and potentially put anyone you come into contact with at risk.”

But it’s the same motivation and message as shaming people going to concerts or shaming people who are holding weddings or shaming people who aren’t wearing masks.

Abrams pointed out that sometimes this shaming works. In April of last year, Vice President Mike Pence paid a visit to the Mayo Clinic without a mask. That visit was photographed and picked up by news outlets which pointed out that he wasn’t just putting himself at risk but was also putting at-risk people at risk. After that instance, Abrams said that Pence began adhering to masks more often, especially in public.

After GOC called out various partiers, some apologized publicly. Barry’s Bootcamp, where at least one partier worked, sent a company memo about quarantining and social distancing. Not unlike Abrams’s Pence example, some people who were shamed showed remorse and promised better behavior in the future.

But the problem is that while shame can be effective for some people, it has its drawbacks. And in a public health sphere, experts say that the downsides have a history of outweighing benefits.

“Shame does have some negative consequences, not the least of which is it makes you feel embarrassed and guilty,” Abrams said. “And in effect, it makes you want to run away and feel terrible about yourself.”

Feeling terrible about yourself doesn’t always result in good behavior.

Shame doesn’t work

The drawback with shaming individuals is that it can cause negative reactions and more negative behavior. It happened with the HIV/AIDS epidemic that still afflicts the US today. It happens with addiction and mental illness. An adverse, very serious reaction to shame is that it doesn’t encourage people to get the help they need.

“Shaming people in any situation really creates a barrier for individuals,” said Jen Balkus, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Washington. Balkus says that this barrier can make it harder to “acknowledge situations where they may have encountered risk.”

In assessing how the HIV/AIDS epidemic was handled, public health officials learned that shame didn’t eliminate risky behavior. Instead, shame drove people to hide or not disclose that behavior. Those reactions are what Balkus and public health officials fear, and what they say is happening in the current pandemic.

“Individuals who might be shamed by their peers or others might not disclose that they were around people where there could be the opportunity for exposure,” Balkus said of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, they may not feel comfortable getting tested, and they may not quarantine or consider other precautions.

HIV/AIDS and Covid-19 are two very different diseases, and the comparison between the two isn’t linear. But Balkus said that the lessons that epidemiologists learned from addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic could inform the conversations we have about the coronavirus. That means eliminating stigma, encouraging people to get tested, promoting better behavior and risk reduction, and teaching people what to do if exposed.

“We learned from the HIV epidemic how to talk with people and to work with them”

“We learned from the HIV epidemic how to talk with people and to work with them,” Balkus said, adding that it’s important to have “an open dialogue to understand what behaviors folks are engaging in and what choices they could make to reduce risk.” Good communication doesn’t mitigate risk entirely, but “it’s about helping empower people to make the best decisions in the moment,” she told me.

The goal is to shift from shaming people into better behavior to modeling and encouraging better behavior — the other, more powerful, side of the boundary.

Balkus and Abrams both said that consistent positive encouragement is a much more effective tool in public health. The absence of it can also help explain why people are, say, going to giant parties despite the amount of risk involved.

Because of the variation in rules — like how indoor dining restrictions and capacity limits vary from state to state — and inconsistent behavior from public leaders, there’s confusion, doubt, and even defiance against the guidelines among the general population. That there are so many people going to these parties or not wearing masks or not paying attention to social distancing measures seems to indicate a failure of getting a message across rather than just a staggering number of individual failures.

That’s a failure on the structural and policy level, Balkus said. “From the very beginning of the pandemic, we have had a fragmented and state-by-state response. It’s really made it incredibly difficult to both try to get a handle on transmission and keep it as low as possible, and keep our communities as safe as we can in this moment,” she said.

What makes this all frustrating is that the shaming seems to be coming from a place of concern and safety. It’s not bad to worry about the danger these parties present. Just because public health officials acknowledge that shame is bad doesn’t mean they think that these parties don’t present a danger.

There are times shame has worked: In the US, we’ve effectively shamed drunk driving and secondhand smoke, achieving a consensus. Giant gatherings during the pandemic — circuit parties, weddings, underground celebrations, etc. — have a lot in common with these public safety concerns. The attendees of these events could potentially infect people who might not even have attended, much the way a drunk driver could cause a fatal accident with another driver or a smoker could affect nonsmokers around them.

Balkus and Abrams said that there are similarities, but the main difference is that the US had years and years to curb drunk driving and smoking. We don’t have that kind of time with the pandemic. We’ve all been asked to change our behavior in such a short amount of time, and the way out isn’t to shun each other. Rather, it’s to care for one another and really focus on amplifying and pushing public health policy and guidelines in clear and helpful ways.

And experts understand that figuring out that balance between shame, concern, stigma, empathy, and policy isn’t easy.

“We are all facing this pandemic together. Nobody is excluded from the hardships. And so I think for all of us, it’s just, it’s really just challenging both to find that empathy for others, and also take care of ourselves. But I think that’s super important to do,” she said.",voxdotcom,"['public', 'social', 'behavior', 'risk', 'health', 'wont', 'change', 'shaming', 'shame', 'parties', 'balkus', 'pandemic']",0

Share All sharing options for: Once you and your friends are vaccinated, can you travel and quit social distancing?

Editor’s note, March 9: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 8 issued new guidelines for fully vaccinated people. Read about the new guidelines here, and for Vox’s latest coverage of vaccine efforts in the US and worldwide, see our storystream.

Now that the vaccines are arriving, people are starting to dream.

They say things like, “The second everyone in my family is vaccinated, we’re going on a big trip to Asia!” or “As soon as my five closest friends and I get the shot, I’m spending a weekend at a cabin with them. No masks, no social distancing.”

While many of us are thinking about the Covid-19 pandemic in binary terms — there’s “life before I get the shot” and “life after I get the shot” — experts are cautioning us to think more gradually. Not everything will change the second that syringe enters your arm.

“Realistically, it’s definitely not going to be an on/off switch on normal,” said Eleanor Murray, a Boston University epidemiologist.

The best way to set realistic expectations around what life will look like in 2021 is to think of it in three stages. Stage 1 is what you can safely do once you and your close friends or family are vaccinated. Stage 2 is what you can safely do once your city or state has reached herd immunity, where enough people are protected against infection that the virus can’t easily spark new outbreaks. Stage 3 is what you can do once herd immunity is reached internationally. (Note that there’s a good chance we won’t reach that last stage in 2021.)

A lot will depend on the answer to a crucial open question: Are the vaccines only good at preventing symptomatic disease, or are they also good at preventing infection and transmission?

“One can imagine a scenario where you are vaccinated and you develop a protective immune response. You will not get sick, you will not die, but the virus will still be able to grow in your nose and transmit to other people,” said Barry Bloom, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard.

Bloom and other experts are optimistic that the vaccines help reduce infection and transmission, but nobody knows by how much. “We just need more data on transmission,” he said. “Hopefully it will come out of the trials in a couple of months.”

In the meantime, even vaccinated people have to assume they can still become infected and pass along the virus. That means they need to keep wearing masks and social distancing whenever they’re around unvaccinated people.

But as more and more people get vaccinated, the question will arise: What about when you’re among people who’ve all been vaccinated? That brings us to stage 1.

Stage 1: You and your close friends or family are vaccinated

Let’s say you and your five closest friends have been vaccinated. Can you all rent a cabin in the woods and spend a weekend together, without masks or social distancing?

The answer is: It’s likely to be fine — with some caveats.

For one thing, vaccines don’t work instantly. “You need to wait at minimum two weeks after the first shot to see any kind of protection, but really you need to wait at least a week after the second shot,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University.

Then there’s the fact that the vaccine may not work equally well in everyone. Some people may have health issues that keep their bodies from mounting quite as successful an immune response. “The fact is, I’m not absolutely sure that everybody who receives the vaccine develops a protective response,” Bloom said.

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines showed 95 percent efficacy at preventing symptomatic disease in trials after two doses. But they’re not 100 percent. There’s still a chance you could pick up the virus from one of your vaccinated friends and develop symptoms. Although the vaccines are very good at preventing the severe symptoms that land people in the hospital, experts can’t rule out the possibility that you’ll develop milder symptoms, which could conceivably turn chronic or “long-haul.”

So the weekend getaway will not be completely safe. But, Rasmussen said, “if your entire group of friends have all gotten the full vaccine regimen and at least a week has passed since their second shot, it probably is okay for you to get together with them in a closed setting, where you’re not interacting with the public. So maybe a vacation where you all get an Airbnb and hang out — but without going bar-hopping! — would be okay.”

Murray agreed the risk would be relatively low, provided you and your friends have no underlying conditions and don’t live with vulnerable unvaccinated people whom you want to protect from infection. “But when you come back and go to the grocery store,” she said, “I’d expect that you’re still wearing masks.”

That’s because there’s a big difference between being in a closed bubble, where you know that everyone is vaccinated, and being in the public domain, where you risk infecting unvaccinated people.

Asked if she would go on the cabin weekend trip, Murray said, “I would probably be comfortable,” but that’s because she doesn’t live near any unvaccinated parents or grandparents whom she needs to keep safe, and because she expects to be in the last group of people to get the vaccine — by which point herd immunity will have built up more, driving down the chances that any of her friends would show up at the cabin unwittingly infected.

Stage 2: Your city or state has reached herd immunity

In public settings, Americans should continue with masking and social distancing until 75 to 85 percent of the population is vaccinated, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He estimates that around that stage — which could come in mid-fall — the US will reach herd immunity. (This is just an estimate, though, and it’s liable to change depending on Covid-19 variants, vaccine uptake rates, and other factors.)

Rather than achieving national immunity all at once, we’re likely to see regions within the US passing the immunity threshold at different times. As each city or state announces that it’s past the threshold, it’ll probably start rolling back requirements gradually. We might see restaurants open up for indoor dining, but with servers continuing to wear masks.

“I think probably masks will be one of the last things to roll back,” Murray said, “because masks don’t have a commercial cost to them. They’re something that’s helpful and doesn’t necessarily cost the economy anything.” Given that there’s a lot of travel between jurisdictions, masks may not be rolled back until the whole country reaches herd immunity.

Once a jurisdiction reaches immunity, people there will be able to safely return to venues like schools, movie theaters, and indoor dining at restaurants (though of course state and local governments have been making these decisions all throughout the pandemic, weighing the indispensability and risks of different venues). The idea is that if, say, 80 percent of people are vaccinated, that creates an “umbrella” of immunity, as Fauci put it, that “would be able to protect even the vulnerables who have not been vaccinated, or those in which the vaccine has not been effective.”

Rasmussen emphasized that if we want to feel not just 95 percent but more like 99 percent safe in public spaces, we need as many people as possible to get vaccinated, because that’s what stops community transmission.

“You can have a lot of great vaccines, but they don’t completely eradicate these viruses unless they’re taken up very, very widely,” she said. “But people are still not thinking about vaccines as a population-level intervention. They’re thinking about them as an individual intervention. It’s very exemplary of this pandemic.”

From the beginning, health experts have tried to get the public to understand that when it comes to the coronavirus, nobody is truly safe until everybody is safe.

Stage 2, for that reason, is not the time for international travel to countries that have not yet achieved herd immunity or that have little health care infrastructure.

If a large region in your country passes the immunity threshold, domestic travel — say, to see vaccinated family members a couple of states over — may be fine. But for your safety and for the sake of people abroad, it’s best to hold off on big international trips.

Stage 3: Herd immunity is reached internationally

Let’s manage expectations right off the bat. There’s a good chance we won’t reach this stage until 2022 or later. That’s because access to the vaccines is far from equal around the world.

“What we’re seeing is the US, Canada, and Europe are getting pretty good access to the vaccine, but if you’re hoping to go to Mozambique or something, a lot of those other countries are not necessarily able to purchase the vaccine and it’ll be a lot longer for those countries,” Murray said.

That’s why it’s so important to have groups like the Covax Facility, a unique financing mechanism that has gotten 190 countries (92 of which are lower-income countries) to pool their resources to end the pandemic faster. It aims to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year to participating countries, regardless of their ability to pay.

How long it takes for various countries to reach herd immunity will depend in part on how fast they can access vaccines and what share of their populations are willing to get the shot. But as mentioned above, there’s another crucial factor.

“It’s really going to come down to what we learn over the next few months about how well the vaccine prevents infection and transmission,” Murray said, adding that she doesn’t expect we’ll have an answer to that until March at the earliest.

If it turns out that the vaccines prevent infection and transmission almost as well as they prevent symptomatic disease, we may see some countries opening their borders to tourists who provide proof of vaccination, in an effort to get the tourism sector and the broader economy going again.

“If we do find that it prevents 95 percent of infections, then I’d say yeah, if you and all your friends are vaccinated, plan that Fiji vacation, go wild, spend your tourism dollars helping economies of places that can’t yet afford the vaccine!” Murray said. “But if it turns out that no … then it would be really inappropriate to be going somewhere where they can’t afford the vaccine and still spreading disease.”

In that scenario, we may have to wait until 2022 or later for travel to some countries to resume.

For now, remember that keeping up with the measures we know curb the spread of the virus — like masking and social distancing — is the best way to ensure we can all get back to normal faster. Yes, we are all sick of them. But the more we stick to them over the next few months, the sooner we can abandon them for good.

2021-01-26 22:09:51+00:00,10,"Since December, a handful of fortunate end-of-day shoppers have received coveted doses of the coronavirus vaccine by simply being in the right place at the right time. That place, during a pandemic, could be a Safeway or a Walgreens. Some of these recipients are young and healthy adults, and have likened their surprise immunization to winning the lottery.

As the country embarks on a decentralized Covid-19 vaccine rollout program, grocery stores and pharmacies are at the forefront of inoculating local residents and, in some cases, issuing leftover doses to whoever might be available. Some social media users have joked about hanging around pharmacies near closing time in the hope of receiving a leftover vaccine dose, instead of allowing it to go to waste.

Los Angeles County, for example, has no official standby line for the coronavirus vaccine, but hundreds of “vaccine chasers” — young people, entire families, and even seniors unable to secure an appointment — have flocked to sites countywide in the hopes of receiving an expiring shot. Getting a vaccine depends on who you know and access to local news: The Los Angeles Times reported that those waiting outside clinics “heard about the opportunity through word of mouth in their social and professional networks,” and some hailed from wealthier neighborhoods.

State and local jurisdictions are being recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue their first vaccine doses to health care personnel, residents of long-term care facilities, and, more recently, adults over 65 and anyone with underlying medical conditions. These are only recommendations, though. Governors and individual vaccination sites are in charge of implementing their own vaccine prioritization plans. As coronavirus cases rise, state officials are amending their vaccine guidelines to include a larger population of people.

The US is lagging behind its projected vaccination goal of 20 million people by the end of 2020; only about 9 million people have received the vaccine’s first dose as of January 11. The two available vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, have to be injected within hours after the doses are thawed from subzero storage temperatures, which complicates their distribution. Health and state officials have begun urging medical providers to consider vaccinating lower-priority groups to minimize vaccine wastage. As a result of these logistical hiccups, a small group of healthy, low-priority people has been administered the vaccine as a measure of last resort.

Group of people I know got vaccinated because they were at the right place at the right time with many doses set to expire & be tossed. — The Natidude (@TheNatidude) January 11, 2021

A number of these random immunizations (that have been publicly documented, at least) have occurred in Washington, DC, where local health officials have encouraged pharmacists to adopt a zero-waste policy. A DC-based law student posted a viral TikTok of his Moderna shot, which he was offered while grocery shopping at a Giant Food. A DC-based reporter was inoculated at Safeway after hearing an in-store announcement that its pharmacy had extra doses left. A DC couple was able to get on a Safeway pharmacy waitlist to receive end-of-day vaccines for when priority patients fail to show up for one.

There have been a few instances reported elsewhere as well: A Louisville couple made news for receiving a Christmas Eve vaccine at a local Walgreens. “[A friend] called us, and we ran right up. It was pure luck,” the recipient told the Courier Journal. The pharmacy later said it sought to prioritize its excess doses to first responders, Walgreens staff, and senior residents as the news garnered attention.

Sudden time-sensitive incidents such as a malfunctioning hospital freezer in Ukiah, California, have forced providers to make rapid distribution decisions with little forethought. But there are also instances of those looking to jump the line if providers are disorganized. The Los Angeles Times reported that at one South LA vaccination site in early January, about 100 people received vaccines without being asked to show proof that they worked in the health care industry.

These stories of circumstantial — even chaotic — vaccinations might provide a semblance of hope for those who fall further down the priority list. According to Business Insider, pharmacies and grocery stores in the DC metro area are already fielding “tons of calls” from interested recipients eager to get on a vaccine waitlist. These last-minute lists in DC, however, have quickly filled up via word of mouth. A pharmacy manager in Pennsylvania told the local Fox News station that it only takes names of those eligible under the state’s 1A categorization, which includes health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, for its “do not waste” list. (The Food and Drug Administration and the federal government have yet to issue guidelines on who these extra doses should go to.)

These waitlists and random occurrences aren’t necessarily cause for optimism, though, especially as the vaccination timeline for most Americans remains unclear and varies from state to state.

“There has been outsized media and social media attention to the number of people this has happened to,” Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy of the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Vox. “It’s a good approach to not waste vaccine doses at the end of the day ... but in the grand scheme of things, it’s going to be a marginal contribution to vaccinations. The bulk of vaccinations being done at pharmacies are for those who fit into the prioritization groups and made appointments.”

It’s possible that vaccine providers might no longer need to resort to waitlists or last-minute immunizations, Michaud said, since the federal government has revised their vaccine recommendations: “We’re seeing more states moving in that direction, so the phenomenon of finding a random person might become less common, simply because there will be more people who fit into those higher-priority categories.”

The public desperation for a last-minute shot signifies a top-down failure of the federal government: Officials have largely ignored expert warnings of the potential for logistical hindrances, and there is no cohesive communication campaign to inform Americans when they’re available for a shot. Even as providers do their best to minimize vaccine waste, the disorganized rollout makes it harder for higher-risk Americans to receive the first vaccine dose. This approach “undercut[s] the needs-based approach to those who are savvy and to those who realize what’s going on,” Arthur Caplan of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University told Business Insider.

The US population has a long way to go to reach herd immunity — which may require 70-85 percent of the population vaccinated — in order for normal life to resume. Officials have maintained that the more people who get vaccinated, the better, and so the general interest toward these random store vaccinations is a good thing. But most members of the public won’t be able to skip the wait, unlike the lucky few on social media, no matter how often they stop by their local pharmacy.",voxdotcom,"['local', 'officials', 'health', 'right', 'vaccine', 'coronavirus', 'doses', 'pharmacy', 'managed', 'random', 'care', 'leftover', 'providers', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-26 21:40:09+00:00,37,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday will announce new efforts to boost Covid-19 vaccine supply and distribution — addressing what’s likely the biggest challenge his administration faces in its first few weeks.

According to senior administration officials, Biden will announce three major actions. First, the administration will increase vaccine supply to states to at least 10 million a week, up from 8.6 million, starting next week. The Department of Health and Human Services will also start providing estimates to states of how many vaccines they’re going to receive at least three weeks in advance, up from one week. And the feds will purchase 100 million doses of each of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, boosting the federal government’s total order from 400 million to 600 million — enough for 300 million Americans.

Officials also referred to other actions the administration is taking, such as using the Defense Production Act to get more syringes that can squeeze one more dose out of vaccines.

The moves build on the executive actions Biden took last week. As part of his Covid-19 and vaccine plans, Biden has promised to do everything within the federal government’s power to boost vaccine supply and distribution.

Currently, the US is lagging. Former President Donald Trump’s administration promised 20 million vaccinations by the end of 2020, but the US still hasn’t hit that mark more than three weeks into 2021, based on federal data. Problems have cropped up across the US, from supply shortages to wasted doses to long lines. Other countries, including Israel and the UK, have pulled ahead of the US on vaccination rates.

It’s a genuinely life-or-death situation. With the US now averaging more than 3,100 Covid-19 deaths a day, every day or week or month of problems means potentially thousands, if not tens of thousands, more preventable deaths due to the coronavirus. Boosting vaccine efforts by just days, then, can literally save thousands of lives — getting the US closer to a herd immunity threshold that experts say is needed to truly stop outbreaks. And it would get the nation back to a social and economic normal faster, too.

For Biden, it’s also a massive political challenge. His handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, along with the economic recovery, is likely how his presidency will be judged. If he fails, Americans will suffer, and they may not think fondly of the administration that let them down.

Biden is trying to confront that reality, and his latest actions chip away at the problem. But, as his administration has acknowledged, more action will be needed in the coming weeks to fully address what’s going wrong.

More federal support is key to smoothing out problems

Biden’s answer to Covid-19 and vaccination efforts is, in some ways, simple: more federal support.

If you look at what’s going wrong with vaccines in the US, it can seem like a bunch of different issues from place to place. But many of these issues are rooted in a lack of federal support for notoriously underresourced public health agencies.

To put it another way: If you asked a bunch of underfunded public health agencies to do a big task in a large, diverse country, then refused more support to help them carry out this task, you would actually expect a lot of different problems to arise by virtue of the country being a big, diverse place. The root problem is a lack of federal support, but how that problem looks in different places will vary widely based on geography, demographics, local and state political environments, and more.

“States aren’t totally off the hook, but what we are seeing is the result of lack of resources and strong guidance (and the historical way in which public health is organized and delivered in the US),” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me.

That helps explain why such a variety of problems have appeared throughout the vaccine effort, from vaccine doses going unused to some equipment breaking down to long lines to insufficient staffing at vaccination sites. These problems are rooted in insufficient resources or guidance; whether one state experiences them while another doesn’t can come down to even hyperlocal variables.

Biden’s announcements on Tuesday chip away at some of these problems. For one, they make it clear that the federal government will supply more vaccine doses — promising to alleviate some of the supply constraints. But they also help states coordinate their efforts: By providing more guidance on how many vaccine doses states can expect to get weeks earlier, state officials can actually plan with those numbers of doses in mind.

But administration officials acknowledged these actions are only a start. They called on Congress to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic relief package, which includes a $400 billion Covid-19 plan and $20 billion for vaccine efforts in particular. That kind of funding, along with the $8 billion Congress approved in December, could go a long way to giving states the resources they need to roll out vaccines.

None of this is particularly groundbreaking. But it’s the kind of thing that the Trump administration resisted doing, as it took a leave-it-to-the-states approach to vaccine distribution and even characterized more support to the states as a federal “invasion.”

Biden has promised a much more involved federal approach. Tuesday’s actions are a small part of how that might work in practice.

2021-01-26 12:58:44+00:00,9,"With the news Wednesday from Pfizer/BioNTech that preliminary data suggests their vaccine is effective and safe in youth ages 12 to 15, Covid-19 shots for those under 16 seem like they might finally be on the horizon. But the big question of whether most kids will be able to get vaccinated before they head back to school in the fall remains.

Children were left out of the earliest vaccine trials as pharmaceutical companies prioritized adults at higher risk of hospitalization and death. Which made sense: The disease has killed approximately 270 children in the US, compared with more than 424,000 people age 65 and older.

But many kids have caught the virus, with about 3.4 million pediatric Covid-19 cases reported as of March 25 — likely a substantial undercount because these cases are often mild or asymptomatic. There have also been more than 2,600 children in the US who have gotten a severe inflammatory syndrome following infection, and many reports of children with persistent, debilitating symptoms after even a mild Covid-19 illness.

Not to mention the broader impact of the pandemic on children’s lives, with less social contact with peers and extended family members, increased risk of abuse at home, and major disruptions to education that is widening the existing chasms of inequality.

Because of these hardships, the National Academy of Medicine, in its fall 2020 recommendations for vaccine allocation, said that children should be in phase 3 of recipients — which would fall before the general adult population and in the same group as many essential workers. But this clearly did not come to pass.

Importantly, we have yet to formally ensure the vaccines are effective and safe in children, whose immune systems can work slightly differently than adults’. (Pfizer/BioNTech’s new data is preliminary and has not yet been peer-reviewed.)

But vaccine companies are racing to gather more data, and the FDA has okayed Pfizer and Moderna to start new studies of their vaccines in kids 11 and younger. Moderna has a trial underway and expects initial results in the coming months. Johnson & Johnson is still in the planning phases.

Pfizer/BioNTech say they’ll submit their new findings on adolescents to the US Food and Drug Administration in the weeks ahead in hopes of having their vaccine authorized for ages 12 and up. (It is currently authorized for emergency use for those 16 and older; Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine can be given to those 18 and up.)

Here’s where we are in learning about the Covid-19 vaccines in children and teens — and what parents, teachers, and family members should do to keep the virus in check before they are ready.

Why most kids can’t get vaccinated for Covid-19 yet

The prospects for kids getting vaccinated are looking good. In addition to the new early Pfizer information on kids 12 to 15, we also have that reassuring pile of data about the vaccines’ safety and efficacy in adults. Nevertheless, several factors make these vaccine trials in children slightly more challenging.

“Since the infection is a mild one in the majority of children, the bar for a Covid-19 vaccine to be safe in children is even higher,” Kristin Moffitt, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital, wrote in an email to Vox. “This is different than an experimental medication designed to treat a terrible disease, where side effects might be tolerated. A vaccine designed to prevent infection must be safe.”

We also cannot assume the vaccines will behave in children exactly as they do in adults. And this is especially true of younger children, who haven’t yet been included in completed trials.

“Children’s immune systems sometimes act slightly differently than adults’ when they’re given the same vaccine,” says James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who also runs clinical trials at the school’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. This is because kids’ immune systems are busy maturing from before birth through mid-childhood.

And although most vaccines work equally well in adults and children, some, such as the pneumococcal vaccine, aren’t effective in children under age 2. (That vaccine, however, is of a different type than the ones authorized for Covid-19.) Others need to be given in different amounts or spaced differently when given to younger kids versus adults.

Most experts do expect younger children will respond well to Covid-19 vaccines. But even then, they’ll still want to find the optimal doses and dose spacing for these immunizations at each age group. This might be different for, say, a 6-month-old than for a 16-year-old.

How scientists are testing Covid-19 vaccines in children

To learn how vaccines work best in kids, scientists usually study them in different age groups. For Covid-19, researchers are working backward down the age ladder.

Starting trials in teenagers makes sense for a number of reasons. First, “adolescents are more likely to experience a similar safety profile and immune response as adults than very young children,” Moffitt explained.

Second, this age group is more likely than younger children (except for infants) to become severely ill and die of the disease.

And, third, data so far suggests that this age group has been more responsible for spreading the virus than younger children, Moffitt explained.

So after studies have gathered enough data from adolescents, researchers can be more confident testing the vaccine in younger age groups. “A vaccine that was safe in 12-year-olds is more likely to be safe in 6- to 11-year-olds than one that has only been tested in adults,” Moffitt said. Likewise, “a vaccine that’s safe in school-aged children is more likely to be safe in toddlers.”

For the youngest children, figuring out not only the best dosing but also when to administer the test vaccines could be tricky.

“Infants and toddlers have a very busy vaccine schedule,” says Campbell, who also helped develop the National Institutes of Health’s pediatric vaccine trial protocols. So researchers need to figure out if they are going to lump the trial Covid-19 vaccine doses in with regular vaccine visits (which can generate their own passing side effects) or administer them between other vaccines (which sometimes fall just a month apart for newborns).

One bit of luck is that children’s vaccine trials can be much smaller than the adult trials. In addition to seeing who among participants naturally got sick with Covid-19, adult vaccine trials have been measuring immune response to the vaccines (by looking for antibodies in the blood).

This immune response data provides a reliable shortcut for trials in kids, showing researchers what a successful immune response to the vaccine looks like. So pediatric studies are looking for similar responses in children to assess whether it is effective in preventing Covid-19, rather than having to wait for dozens of them to come down with the disease.

So whereas each phase 3 adult trial had to enroll tens of thousands of people to find enough naturally occurring infections in a few short months, “as we are only measuring immune response in adolescents, we can get those answers with many less participants,” Robert Frenck, director of vaccine research at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, wrote to Vox in an email. As such, the companies can do studies at less than a tenth of the scale.

The new Pfizer/BioNTech trial tested the vaccine against a placebo in 2,260 adolescents. In those who received the shot, the companies say a robust antibody response was seen, equating, they say, with 100 percent efficacy — an even better result than in those ages 16 to 25, the company reported in a press release. The company said no safety concerns emerged and side effects were similar to those seen in young adults.

In addition to apparently universal antibody coverage, the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy also seemed to play out in the real world. Eighteen of the adolescents in the placebo group ended up getting Covid-19, but none in the vaccinated group.

And the FDA has cleared vaccine makers to rapidly expand testing in younger ages. Pfizer and Moderna both have early-stage studies underway in participants as young as 6 months. Pfizer is structuring research based on age group cohorts: 5 to 11 years, 2 to 5 years, and 6 months to 2 years, testing different doses in each.

The first experimental shots were given to kids in the 5- to 11-year-old age group last week, and they plan to give the first ones in the 2- to 5-year group next week, the company reported.

Moderna announced earlier this month that it has also started administering the vaccine to its pediatric trial participants younger than 12. Although early data is expected by this summer, it plans to also follow kids for a year after their shots to track longer-term efficacy and safety.

Will kids get the Covid-19 vaccine before the next school year?

Even if a Covid-19 vaccine hasn’t been authorized or distributed for most children by the end of the summer, it might still be possible to safely send students back to school. “If you are in a situation where you have drastically reduced mortality, you have covered the most vulnerable people, you have vaccinated the teachers, and have scaled up targeted testing for schoolchildren, you have a viable way of opening schools,” says Saad Omer, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Medicine.

And getting kids safely back to in-person learning will be incredibly important to prevent further disparities from emerging and get education back on track. For younger children especially, they “have a shorter window for development, where if they miss it, there are long-term consequences,” says Omer, who was on the National Academy of Medicine committee that recommended children for phase 3 vaccine priority.

But the ultimate goal will be to have children vaccinated against the virus, and as soon as safely possible. So the leading vaccine companies are working hard to get the necessary approvals. Pfizer says it hopes it will be possible “to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year,” CEO Albert Bourla said in a press statement.

And the CDC is paying attention. Its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices “is closely monitoring clinical trials in children and adolescents,” according to a December paper.

Many experts are optimistic that vaccines will be authorized for children as solid data comes in. “I think a good antibody response — with a good safety profile — in kids will be sufficient to have a vaccine candidate licensed,” said Frenck, who has worked on the Pfizer vaccine trials of 12- to 15-year-olds.

Omer agrees. “You don’t have to complete the trial. Even initial preliminary data may suffice.”

But it is still unclear if most children under the age of 16 will be able to be vaccinated before the start of the next school year. And the order in which children will be eligible for an approved vaccine will likely follow the sequence of trials, with adolescents coming first. “If we can at least get down to the older kids, it would be great,” Campbell says.

One big question still hangs in the balance about the utility of vaccinating all children, however. A lot of the impetus to vaccinate children has been not just to reduce incidence of the disease in that group but also to reduce kids’ role in spreading the disease. However, we still don’t have thorough information on how well the vaccines do this.

Early data suggests the vaccines might reduce the rate at which people carry the virus without getting sick. But we are still waiting for more details from the adult studies. “The most likely scenario is that you’re going to get the best protection against the most severe disease, 95 percent protection against all disease, and slightly lower protection against all infection,” Campbell says. (This thinking also helped inform the CDC’s March guidelines for fully vaccinated people.)

Even this level of protection, however, could go a long way in improving children’s lives — and those of their parents. It could allow them to much more safely play with friends and participate in more normal activities.

What should we do before a Covid-19 vaccine is available for kids?

Covid-19 continues to spread, with new worrying upticks in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in several regions across the country. And kids remain vulnerable to getting the illness and to spreading it to others of any age.

So instead of having chickenpox-style Covid-19 exposure parties for kids, which can be dangerous, public health experts advocate continued vigilance against the virus. The CDC recommends children follow similar guidelines to unvaccinated adults. They should wash their hands frequently, avoid or limit contact with unvaccinated people outside their household, avoid those at high risk for the illness, wear a mask in public starting at age 2, have high-touch surfaces and toys disinfected frequently, and avoid unnecessary travel.

But with the early encouraging news from the first Covid-19 vaccine kids trial, we have more reason to expect shots for kids will be coming.

In the meantime, there’s no time to waste in helping prepare pediatricians and families for the vaccines’ arrival for kids, Campbell says. A January survey by the National Parents Union found that only about 35 percent of parents would immediately immunize their children against the disease, and almost a quarter would not get the shots for them at all. If a vast number of kids aren’t vaccinated, they could become a reservoir for the virus, spurring future outbreaks.

But Campbell is hopeful that time and experience will help resolve some of this reluctance. By the time these shots are available for kids, in addition to strong results from pediatric studies, he hopes many of the current questions and wariness around the new vaccines will also be soothed by the months of success in adults.

2021-01-26 11:01:07+00:00,22,"As a doctor, one of the most common questions I’ve gotten throughout the pandemic is whether flying is “safe.”

The question has new urgency, with more contagious variants of Covid-19 spreading around the world, and with the new US policy, effective January 26, that requires all passengers flying into the country to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight.

The answer to whether flying is safe, as with most questions in this epidemic, is that it’s complicated.

Outbreaks of Covid-19 on flights have been documented multiple times since the start of the pandemic, albeit seemingly more so before masks were widely worn on planes. But one recent outbreak on a long-haul flight from Dubai to New Zealand highlights why flights can be anywhere from safe to unsafe depending on a number of factors. It’s also an example of why viral transmission is not so much a single event, but the result of multiple lapses in safety.

New genomic data from the flight outbreak this fall sheds light on exactly how complicated tracing the dynamics of transmission in any environment can be — even one as controlled as an international plane ride.

We still don’t know exactly why this flight turned into a spreading event

On an 18-hour flight from Dubai to New Zealand this past September, four passengers were infected by one other passenger who boarded the flight unaware that they were infected with Covid-19. Some have pointed to this outbreak as evidence that flying is unsafe, but I think this misses a number of more crucial points.

It’s most important to understand that transmission doesn’t just happen. It actually takes a number of protections falling apart one after the other. This is invoked in the “Swiss cheese model,” in which most single methods of prevention cannot block all transmission, but a layered approach of multiple precautions can stop most spread.

In this particular outbreak, two of the four passengers who got infected reported wearing masks during the flight. It also happened despite pre-departure testing. The person who brought the virus onto the plane was incorrectly reported as having been tested within 48 hours of the flight, when in fact their negative test was from four days before. The people involved in the outbreak were sitting within four rows of one another, but not everyone in that radius later tested positive for the virus. Additionally, the plane’s power unit was down for 30 minutes during a refueling in Kuala Lumpur, meaning the ventilation system was turned off.

All of these factors introduce a number of “what ifs” that we can ask about what could have prevented the transmission — and whether improving these steps could make other flights safer.

For example, what if the index case — the original infected passenger — had been tested within two or three days of the flight? It’s very possible that their infection would have been picked up and they never would have boarded. What if the airline had used rapid antigen testing at the airport, which we know is excellent at detecting people who are very contagious? Of note for this outbreak is that the index case didn’t report any symptoms until two days after the flight, so pre-boarding symptom screening or fever checks also would not have caught them.

What if the passengers were sitting further from the index case, or if the flight were shorter? We know that distance from index case and duration of contact during travel are both related to a higher virus attack rate.

As of now, only Delta blocks middle seats, and Alaska Airlines does so in the premium section. And in the September outbreak, none of those who caught the virus on the flight were sitting directly next to the index case. Some were two rows ahead, others behind.

What if the power unit had not been turned off? We know airplanes have great ventilation with HEPA filtration that can block viruses — when the system is running. But there is virtually no way to guarantee a flight won’t have to power off its air systems for unforeseen reasons, such as maintenance issues or de-icing.

What if the passengers and index cases were all wearing better masks — such as high-filtration KF94, KN95, elastomeric N95, or N95 masks, which can provide better control of virus spread and personal protection? We know that these “hi-fi” masks can function as effectively as vaccines, if not better, in stopping transmission when worn correctly and at times of high risk.

When I tweeted about this outbreak, a number of people quickly chimed in — some saying transmission happened because the vents were off, others saying because passengers didn’t have better masks. Ultimately, we don’t know for sure which of these things it was; more likely, it was a combination of all of them.

What this also demonstrates is that it can actually be somewhat complicated to fully understand how much Covid-19 transmission is happening directly on flights and in other venues.

We’re probably missing most Covid-19 spread on planes in the US

In the case of this particular flight, New Zealand — which has had a remarkably low incidence of Covid-19 — actually had a mandatory quarantine period during which passengers were in government facilities for 14 days, and were monitored with regular testing. This allowed researchers to isolate the potential transmission points to the flight or airport. But infected passengers reported no close contact with one another in the airport. Genomic studies helped trace the infections as having most likely occurred on the flight itself, given that the viral samples all shared the same lineage. This level of follow-up is rarely happening in the US.

In the US currently, you can walk off a flight and your quarantine period and subsequent testing are on the honor system, despite being recommended by the CDC. If people don’t strictly quarantine, it quickly becomes much harder to know if transmission happened on the flight or afterward, like on your ride-share from the airport, at your relative’s house, or during some other activity.

We really don’t have a great understanding of how many infections are happening on flights. And as planes become more crowded, community transmission increases, and new, more contagious variants of the virus proliferate, the chance that someone who is actively infected is sitting next to you goes up as well.

One proxy for this risk might be the infection rate among airline staff, and this could be interesting and important to monitor over time. In Canada, infections and exposures on flights are far more readily documented, with a nearly daily list of flights that had infected passengers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the country’s health officials have identified more than 3,000 flights landing in Canada (domestic and international) on which at least one person had Covid-19. The US would benefit from doing the same, although this needs to be coupled with rapid contact tracing as well.

Does all this mean that flights are dangerous? Does this mean don’t fly?

I would say that, ultimately, it depends on numerous protections holding up, which at times can and will be out of our control, both for flights and for all other activities that we partake in.

I would recommend against unnecessary travel right now, not only because I am concerned about what happens on the flight (even if many flights are ultimately low-risk) but also because of what happens after the flight. We have no enforcement on quarantining after travel, and many people cannot safely quarantine at home. The more we move around and meet up with others, the more the virus spreads.

And a single negative test three days beforehand won’t stop that, even if it picks up some infections and prevents some outbreaks on international flights. We should, in fact, be increasing all prevention measures, especially on domestic flights. With new Covid-19 variants, even our airplane travel will require that we do many things right to avoid one especially wrong outcome.

2021-01-26 01:15:25+00:00,16,"With the news Wednesday from Pfizer/BioNTech that preliminary data suggests their vaccine is effective and safe in youth ages 12 to 15, Covid-19 shots for those under 16 seem like they might finally be on the horizon. But the big question of whether most kids will be able to get vaccinated before they head back to school in the fall remains.

Children were left out of the earliest vaccine trials as pharmaceutical companies prioritized adults at higher risk of hospitalization and death. Which made sense: The disease has killed approximately 270 children in the US, compared with more than 424,000 people age 65 and older.

But many kids have caught the virus, with about 3.4 million pediatric Covid-19 cases reported as of March 25 — likely a substantial undercount because these cases are often mild or asymptomatic. There have also been more than 2,600 children in the US who have gotten a severe inflammatory syndrome following infection, and many reports of children with persistent, debilitating symptoms after even a mild Covid-19 illness.

Not to mention the broader impact of the pandemic on children’s lives, with less social contact with peers and extended family members, increased risk of abuse at home, and major disruptions to education that is widening the existing chasms of inequality.

Because of these hardships, the National Academy of Medicine, in its fall 2020 recommendations for vaccine allocation, said that children should be in phase 3 of recipients — which would fall before the general adult population and in the same group as many essential workers. But this clearly did not come to pass.

Importantly, we have yet to formally ensure the vaccines are effective and safe in children, whose immune systems can work slightly differently than adults’. (Pfizer/BioNTech’s new data is preliminary and has not yet been peer-reviewed.)

But vaccine companies are racing to gather more data, and the FDA has okayed Pfizer and Moderna to start new studies of their vaccines in kids 11 and younger. Moderna has a trial underway and expects initial results in the coming months. Johnson & Johnson is still in the planning phases.

Pfizer/BioNTech say they’ll submit their new findings on adolescents to the US Food and Drug Administration in the weeks ahead in hopes of having their vaccine authorized for ages 12 and up. (It is currently authorized for emergency use for those 16 and older; Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine can be given to those 18 and up.)

Here’s where we are in learning about the Covid-19 vaccines in children and teens — and what parents, teachers, and family members should do to keep the virus in check before they are ready.

Why most kids can’t get vaccinated for Covid-19 yet

The prospects for kids getting vaccinated are looking good. In addition to the new early Pfizer information on kids 12 to 15, we also have that reassuring pile of data about the vaccines’ safety and efficacy in adults. Nevertheless, several factors make these vaccine trials in children slightly more challenging.

“Since the infection is a mild one in the majority of children, the bar for a Covid-19 vaccine to be safe in children is even higher,” Kristin Moffitt, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital, wrote in an email to Vox. “This is different than an experimental medication designed to treat a terrible disease, where side effects might be tolerated. A vaccine designed to prevent infection must be safe.”

We also cannot assume the vaccines will behave in children exactly as they do in adults. And this is especially true of younger children, who haven’t yet been included in completed trials.

“Children’s immune systems sometimes act slightly differently than adults’ when they’re given the same vaccine,” says James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who also runs clinical trials at the school’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. This is because kids’ immune systems are busy maturing from before birth through mid-childhood.

And although most vaccines work equally well in adults and children, some, such as the pneumococcal vaccine, aren’t effective in children under age 2. (That vaccine, however, is of a different type than the ones authorized for Covid-19.) Others need to be given in different amounts or spaced differently when given to younger kids versus adults.

Most experts do expect younger children will respond well to Covid-19 vaccines. But even then, they’ll still want to find the optimal doses and dose spacing for these immunizations at each age group. This might be different for, say, a 6-month-old than for a 16-year-old.

How scientists are testing Covid-19 vaccines in children

To learn how vaccines work best in kids, scientists usually study them in different age groups. For Covid-19, researchers are working backward down the age ladder.

Starting trials in teenagers makes sense for a number of reasons. First, “adolescents are more likely to experience a similar safety profile and immune response as adults than very young children,” Moffitt explained.

Second, this age group is more likely than younger children (except for infants) to become severely ill and die of the disease.

And, third, data so far suggests that this age group has been more responsible for spreading the virus than younger children, Moffitt explained.

So after studies have gathered enough data from adolescents, researchers can be more confident testing the vaccine in younger age groups. “A vaccine that was safe in 12-year-olds is more likely to be safe in 6- to 11-year-olds than one that has only been tested in adults,” Moffitt said. Likewise, “a vaccine that’s safe in school-aged children is more likely to be safe in toddlers.”

For the youngest children, figuring out not only the best dosing but also when to administer the test vaccines could be tricky.

“Infants and toddlers have a very busy vaccine schedule,” says Campbell, who also helped develop the National Institutes of Health’s pediatric vaccine trial protocols. So researchers need to figure out if they are going to lump the trial Covid-19 vaccine doses in with regular vaccine visits (which can generate their own passing side effects) or administer them between other vaccines (which sometimes fall just a month apart for newborns).

One bit of luck is that children’s vaccine trials can be much smaller than the adult trials. In addition to seeing who among participants naturally got sick with Covid-19, adult vaccine trials have been measuring immune response to the vaccines (by looking for antibodies in the blood).

This immune response data provides a reliable shortcut for trials in kids, showing researchers what a successful immune response to the vaccine looks like. So pediatric studies are looking for similar responses in children to assess whether it is effective in preventing Covid-19, rather than having to wait for dozens of them to come down with the disease.

So whereas each phase 3 adult trial had to enroll tens of thousands of people to find enough naturally occurring infections in a few short months, “as we are only measuring immune response in adolescents, we can get those answers with many less participants,” Robert Frenck, director of vaccine research at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, wrote to Vox in an email. As such, the companies can do studies at less than a tenth of the scale.

In those who received the shot, the companies say a robust antibody response was seen, equating, they say, with 100 percent efficacy — an even better result than in those ages 16 to 25, the company reported in a press release. The company said no safety concerns emerged and side effects were similar to those seen in young adults.

In addition to apparently universal antibody coverage, the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy also seemed to play out in the real world. Eighteen of the adolescents in the placebo group ended up getting Covid-19, but none in the vaccinated group.

And the FDA has cleared vaccine makers to rapidly expand testing in younger ages. Pfizer and Moderna both have early-stage studies underway in participants as young as 6 months. Pfizer is structuring research based on age group cohorts: 5 to 11 years, 2 to 5 years, and 6 months to 2 years, testing different doses in each.

The first experimental shots were given to kids in the 5- to 11-year-old age group last week, and they plan to give the first ones in the 2- to 5-year group next week, the company reported.

Moderna announced earlier this month that it has also started administering the vaccine to its pediatric trial participants younger than 12. Although early data is expected by this summer, it plans to also follow kids for a year after their shots to track longer-term efficacy and safety.

Will kids get the Covid-19 vaccine before the next school year?

Even if a Covid-19 vaccine hasn’t been authorized or distributed for most children by the end of the summer, it might still be possible to safely send students back to school. “If you are in a situation where you have drastically reduced mortality, you have covered the most vulnerable people, you have vaccinated the teachers, and have scaled up targeted testing for schoolchildren, you have a viable way of opening schools,” says Saad Omer, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Medicine.

And getting kids safely back to in-person learning will be incredibly important to prevent further disparities from emerging and get education back on track.

And the order in which children will be eligible for an approved vaccine will likely follow the sequence of trials, with adolescents coming first. “If we can at least get down to the older kids, it would be great,” Campbell says.

One big question still hangs in the balance about the utility of vaccinating all children, however. A lot of the impetus to vaccinate children has been not just to reduce incidence of the disease in that group but also to reduce kids’ role in spreading the disease. However, we still don’t have thorough information on how well the vaccines do this.

Early data suggests the vaccines might reduce the rate at which people carry the virus without getting sick. But we are still waiting for more details from the adult studies. “The most likely scenario is that you’re going to get the best protection against the most severe disease, 95 percent protection against all disease, and slightly lower protection against all infection,” Campbell says. (This thinking also helped inform the CDC’s March guidelines for fully vaccinated people.)

Even this level of protection, however, could go a long way in improving children’s lives — and those of their parents. It could allow them to much more safely play with friends and participate in more normal activities.

What should we do before a Covid-19 vaccine is available for kids?

Covid-19 continues to spread, with new worrying upticks in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in several regions across the country. And kids remain vulnerable to getting the illness and to spreading it to others of any age.

So instead of having chickenpox-style Covid-19 exposure parties for kids, which can be dangerous, public health experts advocate continued vigilance against the virus. The CDC recommends children follow similar guidelines to unvaccinated adults. They should wash their hands frequently, avoid or limit contact with unvaccinated people outside their household, avoid those at high risk for the illness, wear a mask in public starting at age 2, have high-touch surfaces and toys disinfected frequently, and avoid unnecessary travel.

If a vast number of kids aren’t vaccinated, they could become a reservoir for the virus, spurring future outbreaks.

But Campbell is hopeful that time and experience will help resolve some of this reluctance. By the time these shots are available for kids, in addition to strong results from pediatric studies, he hopes many of the current questions and wariness around the new vaccines will also be soothed by the months of success in adults.

The answer to whether flying is safe, as with most questions in this epidemic, is that it’s complicated.

Outbreaks of Covid-19 on flights have been documented multiple times since the start of the pandemic, albeit seemingly more so before masks were widely worn on planes. But one recent outbreak on a long-haul flight from Dubai to New Zealand highlights why flights can be anywhere from safe to unsafe depending on a number of factors. It’s also an example of why viral transmission is not so much a single event, but the result of multiple lapses in safety.

New genomic data from the flight outbreak this fall sheds light on exactly how complicated tracing the dynamics of transmission in any environment can be — even one as controlled as an international plane ride.

We still don’t know exactly why this flight turned into a spreading event

On an 18-hour flight from Dubai to New Zealand this past September, four passengers were infected by one other passenger who boarded the flight unaware that they were infected with Covid-19. Some have pointed to this outbreak as evidence that flying is unsafe, but I think this misses a number of more crucial points.

It’s most important to understand that transmission doesn’t just happen. It actually takes a number of protections falling apart one after the other. This is invoked in the “Swiss cheese model,” in which most single methods of prevention cannot block all transmission, but a layered approach of multiple precautions can stop most spread.

In this particular outbreak, two of the four passengers who got infected reported wearing masks during the flight. It also happened despite pre-departure testing. The person who brought the virus onto the plane was incorrectly reported as having been tested within 48 hours of the flight, when in fact their negative test was from four days before. The people involved in the outbreak were sitting within four rows of one another, but not everyone in that radius later tested positive for the virus. Additionally, the plane’s power unit was down for 30 minutes during a refueling in Kuala Lumpur, meaning the ventilation system was turned off.

All of these factors introduce a number of “what ifs” that we can ask about what could have prevented the transmission — and whether improving these steps could make other flights safer.

For example, what if the index case — the original infected passenger — had been tested within two or three days of the flight? It’s very possible that their infection would have been picked up and they never would have boarded. What if the airline had used rapid antigen testing at the airport, which we know is excellent at detecting people who are very contagious? Of note for this outbreak is that the index case didn’t report any symptoms until two days after the flight, so pre-boarding symptom screening or fever checks also would not have caught them.

What if the passengers were sitting further from the index case, or if the flight were shorter? We know that distance from index case and duration of contact during travel are both related to a higher virus attack rate.

As of now, only Delta blocks middle seats, and Alaska Airlines does so in the premium section. And in the September outbreak, none of those who caught the virus on the flight were sitting directly next to the index case. Some were two rows ahead, others behind.

What if the power unit had not been turned off? We know airplanes have great ventilation with HEPA filtration that can block viruses — when the system is running. But there is virtually no way to guarantee a flight won’t have to power off its air systems for unforeseen reasons, such as maintenance issues or de-icing.

What if the passengers and index cases were all wearing better masks — such as high-filtration KF94, KN95, elastomeric N95, or N95 masks, which can provide better control of virus spread and personal protection? We know that these “hi-fi” masks can function as effectively as vaccines, if not better, in stopping transmission when worn correctly and at times of high risk.

When I tweeted about this outbreak, a number of people quickly chimed in — some saying transmission happened because the vents were off, others saying because passengers didn’t have better masks. Ultimately, we don’t know for sure which of these things it was; more likely, it was a combination of all of them.

What this also demonstrates is that it can actually be somewhat complicated to fully understand how much Covid-19 transmission is happening directly on flights and in other venues.

We’re probably missing most Covid-19 spread on planes in the US

In the case of this particular flight, New Zealand — which has had a remarkably low incidence of Covid-19 — actually had a mandatory quarantine period during which passengers were in government facilities for 14 days, and were monitored with regular testing. This allowed researchers to isolate the potential transmission points to the flight or airport. But infected passengers reported no close contact with one another in the airport. Genomic studies helped trace the infections as having most likely occurred on the flight itself, given that the viral samples all shared the same lineage. This level of follow-up is rarely happening in the US.

In the US currently, you can walk off a flight and your quarantine period and subsequent testing are on the honor system, despite being recommended by the CDC. If people don’t strictly quarantine, it quickly becomes much harder to know if transmission happened on the flight or afterward, like on your ride-share from the airport, at your relative’s house, or during some other activity.

We really don’t have a great understanding of how many infections are happening on flights. And as planes become more crowded, community transmission increases, and new, more contagious variants of the virus proliferate, the chance that someone who is actively infected is sitting next to you goes up as well.

One proxy for this risk might be the infection rate among airline staff, and this could be interesting and important to monitor over time. In Canada, infections and exposures on flights are far more readily documented, with a nearly daily list of flights that had infected passengers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the country’s health officials have identified more than 3,000 flights landing in Canada (domestic and international) on which at least one person had Covid-19. The US would benefit from doing the same, although this needs to be coupled with rapid contact tracing as well.

Does all this mean that flights are dangerous? Does this mean don’t fly?

I would say that, ultimately, it depends on numerous protections holding up, which at times can and will be out of our control, both for flights and for all other activities that we partake in.

I would recommend against unnecessary travel right now, not only because I am concerned about what happens on the flight (even if many flights are ultimately low-risk) but also because of what happens after the flight. We have no enforcement on quarantining after travel, and many people cannot safely quarantine at home. The more we move around and meet up with others, the more the virus spreads.

And a single negative test three days beforehand won’t stop that, even if it picks up some infections and prevents some outbreaks on international flights. We should, in fact, be increasing all prevention measures, especially on domestic flights. With new Covid-19 variants, even our airplane travel will require that we do many things right to avoid one especially wrong outcome.

2021-01-25 20:10:03+00:00,31,"As a doctor, one of the most common questions I’ve gotten throughout the pandemic is whether flying is “safe.”

The question has new urgency, with more contagious variants of Covid-19 spreading around the world, and with the new US policy, effective January 26, that requires all passengers flying into the country to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight.

The answer to whether flying is safe, as with most questions in this epidemic, is that it’s complicated.

Outbreaks of Covid-19 on flights have been documented multiple times since the start of the pandemic, albeit seemingly more so before masks were widely worn on planes. But one recent outbreak on a long-haul flight from Dubai to New Zealand highlights why flights can be anywhere from safe to unsafe depending on a number of factors. It’s also an example of why viral transmission is not so much a single event, but the result of multiple lapses in safety.

New genomic data from the flight outbreak this fall sheds light on exactly how complicated tracing the dynamics of transmission in any environment can be — even one as controlled as an international plane ride.

We still don’t know exactly why this flight turned into a spreading event

On an 18-hour flight from Dubai to New Zealand this past September, four passengers were infected by one other passenger who boarded the flight unaware that they were infected with Covid-19. Some have pointed to this outbreak as evidence that flying is unsafe, but I think this misses a number of more crucial points.

It’s most important to understand that transmission doesn’t just happen. It actually takes a number of protections falling apart one after the other. This is invoked in the “Swiss cheese model,” in which most single methods of prevention cannot block all transmission, but a layered approach of multiple precautions can stop most spread.

In this particular outbreak, two of the four passengers who got infected reported wearing masks during the flight. It also happened despite pre-departure testing. The person who brought the virus onto the plane was incorrectly reported as having been tested within 48 hours of the flight, when in fact their negative test was from four days before. The people involved in the outbreak were sitting within four rows of one another, but not everyone in that radius later tested positive for the virus. Additionally, the plane’s power unit was down for 30 minutes during a refueling in Kuala Lumpur, meaning the ventilation system was turned off.

All of these factors introduce a number of “what ifs” that we can ask about what could have prevented the transmission — and whether improving these steps could make other flights safer.

For example, what if the index case — the original infected passenger — had been tested within two or three days of the flight? It’s very possible that their infection would have been picked up and they never would have boarded. What if the airline had used rapid antigen testing at the airport, which we know is excellent at detecting people who are very contagious? Of note for this outbreak is that the index case didn’t report any symptoms until two days after the flight, so pre-boarding symptom screening or fever checks also would not have caught them.

What if the passengers were sitting further from the index case, or if the flight were shorter? We know that distance from index case and duration of contact during travel are both related to a higher virus attack rate.

As of now, only Delta blocks middle seats, and Alaska Airlines does so in the premium section. And in the September outbreak, none of those who caught the virus on the flight were sitting directly next to the index case. Some were two rows ahead, others behind.

2021-01-25 17:00:14+00:00,9,"With the news Wednesday from Pfizer/BioNTech that preliminary data suggests their vaccine is effective and safe in youth ages 12 to 15, Covid-19 shots for those under 16 seem like they might finally be on the horizon. But the big question of whether most kids will be able to get vaccinated before they head back to school in the fall remains.

Children were left out of the earliest vaccine trials as pharmaceutical companies prioritized adults at higher risk of hospitalization and death. Which made sense: The disease has killed approximately 270 children in the US, compared with more than 424,000 people age 65 and older.

But many kids have caught the virus, with about 3.4 million pediatric Covid-19 cases reported as of March 25 — likely a substantial undercount because these cases are often mild or asymptomatic. There have also been more than 2,600 children in the US who have gotten a severe inflammatory syndrome following infection, and many reports of children with persistent, debilitating symptoms after even a mild Covid-19 illness.

Not to mention the broader impact of the pandemic on children’s lives, with less social contact with peers and extended family members, increased risk of abuse at home, and major disruptions to education that is widening the existing chasms of inequality.

Because of these hardships, the National Academy of Medicine, in its fall 2020 recommendations for vaccine allocation, said that children should be in phase 3 of recipients — which would fall before the general adult population and in the same group as many essential workers. But this clearly did not come to pass.

Importantly, we have yet to formally ensure the vaccines are effective and safe in children, whose immune systems can work slightly differently than adults’. (Pfizer/BioNTech’s new data is preliminary and has not yet been peer-reviewed.)

But vaccine companies are racing to gather more data, and the FDA has okayed Pfizer and Moderna to start new studies of their vaccines in kids 11 and younger. Moderna has a trial underway and expects initial results in the coming months. Johnson & Johnson is still in the planning phases.

Pfizer/BioNTech say they’ll submit their new findings on adolescents to the US Food and Drug Administration in the weeks ahead in hopes of having their vaccine authorized for ages 12 and up. (It is currently authorized for emergency use for those 16 and older; Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine can be given to those 18 and up.)

Here’s where we are in learning about the Covid-19 vaccines in children and teens — and what parents, teachers, and family members should do to keep the virus in check before they are ready.

Why most kids can’t get vaccinated for Covid-19 yet

The prospects for kids getting vaccinated are looking good. In addition to the new early Pfizer information on kids 12 to 15, we also have that reassuring pile of data about the vaccines’ safety and efficacy in adults. Nevertheless, several factors make these vaccine trials in children slightly more challenging.

“Since the infection is a mild one in the majority of children, the bar for a Covid-19 vaccine to be safe in children is even higher,” Kristin Moffitt, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital, wrote in an email to Vox. “This is different than an experimental medication designed to treat a terrible disease, where side effects might be tolerated. A vaccine designed to prevent infection must be safe.”

We also cannot assume the vaccines will behave in children exactly as they do in adults. And this is especially true of younger children, who haven’t yet been included in completed trials.

“Children’s immune systems sometimes act slightly differently than adults’ when they’re given the same vaccine,” says James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who also runs clinical trials at the school’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. This is because kids’ immune systems are busy maturing from before birth through mid-childhood.

And although most vaccines work equally well in adults and children, some, such as the pneumococcal vaccine, aren’t effective in children under age 2. (That vaccine, however, is of a different type than the ones authorized for Covid-19.) Others need to be given in different amounts or spaced differently when given to younger kids versus adults.

Most experts do expect younger children will respond well to Covid-19 vaccines. But even then, they’ll still want to find the optimal doses and dose spacing for these immunizations at each age group. This might be different for, say, a 6-month-old than for a 16-year-old.

How scientists are testing Covid-19 vaccines in children

To learn how vaccines work best in kids, scientists usually study them in different age groups. For Covid-19, researchers are working backward down the age ladder.

Starting trials in teenagers makes sense for a number of reasons. First, “adolescents are more likely to experience a similar safety profile and immune response as adults than very young children,” Moffitt explained.

Second, this age group is more likely than younger children (except for infants) to become severely ill and die of the disease.

And, third, data so far suggests that this age group has been more responsible for spreading the virus than younger children, Moffitt explained.

So after studies have gathered enough data from adolescents, researchers can be more confident testing the vaccine in younger age groups. “A vaccine that was safe in 12-year-olds is more likely to be safe in 6- to 11-year-olds than one that has only been tested in adults,” Moffitt said. Likewise, “a vaccine that’s safe in school-aged children is more likely to be safe in toddlers.”

For the youngest children, figuring out not only the best dosing but also when to administer the test vaccines could be tricky.

“Infants and toddlers have a very busy vaccine schedule,” says Campbell, who also helped develop the National Institutes of Health’s pediatric vaccine trial protocols. So researchers need to figure out if they are going to lump the trial Covid-19 vaccine doses in with regular vaccine visits (which can generate their own passing side effects) or administer them between other vaccines (which sometimes fall just a month apart for newborns).

One bit of luck is that children’s vaccine trials can be much smaller than the adult trials. In addition to seeing who among participants naturally got sick with Covid-19, adult vaccine trials have been measuring immune response to the vaccines (by looking for antibodies in the blood).

This immune response data provides a reliable shortcut for trials in kids, showing researchers what a successful immune response to the vaccine looks like. So pediatric studies are looking for similar responses in children to assess whether it is effective in preventing Covid-19, rather than having to wait for dozens of them to come down with the disease.

So whereas each phase 3 adult trial had to enroll tens of thousands of people to find enough naturally occurring infections in a few short months, “as we are only measuring immune response in adolescents, we can get those answers with many less participants,” Robert Frenck, director of vaccine research at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, wrote to Vox in an email. As such, the companies can do studies at less than a tenth of the scale.

The new Pfizer/BioNTech trial tested the vaccine against a placebo in 2,260 adolescents. In those who received the shot, the companies say a robust antibody response was seen, equating, they say, with 100 percent efficacy — an even better result than in those ages 16 to 25, the company reported in a press release. The company said no safety concerns emerged and side effects were similar to those seen in young adults.

In addition to apparently universal antibody coverage, the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy also seemed to play out in the real world. Eighteen of the adolescents in the placebo group ended up getting Covid-19, but none in the vaccinated group.

And the FDA has cleared vaccine makers to rapidly expand testing in younger ages. Pfizer and Moderna both have early-stage studies underway in participants as young as 6 months. Pfizer is structuring research based on age group cohorts: 5 to 11 years, 2 to 5 years, and 6 months to 2 years, testing different doses in each.

The first experimental shots were given to kids in the 5- to 11-year-old age group last week, and they plan to give the first ones in the 2- to 5-year group next week, the company reported.

Moderna announced earlier this month that it has also started administering the vaccine to its pediatric trial participants younger than 12. Although early data is expected by this summer, it plans to also follow kids for a year after their shots to track longer-term efficacy and safety.

Will kids get the Covid-19 vaccine before the next school year?

Even if a Covid-19 vaccine hasn’t been authorized or distributed for most children by the end of the summer, it might still be possible to safely send students back to school. “If you are in a situation where you have drastically reduced mortality, you have covered the most vulnerable people, you have vaccinated the teachers, and have scaled up targeted testing for schoolchildren, you have a viable way of opening schools,” says Saad Omer, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Medicine.

And getting kids safely back to in-person learning will be incredibly important to prevent further disparities from emerging and get education back on track. For younger children especially, they “have a shorter window for development, where if they miss it, there are long-term consequences,” says Omer, who was on the National Academy of Medicine committee that recommended children for phase 3 vaccine priority.

But the ultimate goal will be to have children vaccinated against the virus, and as soon as safely possible. So the leading vaccine companies are working hard to get the necessary approvals. Pfizer says it hopes it will be possible “to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year,” CEO Albert Bourla said in a press statement.

And the CDC is paying attention. Its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices “is closely monitoring clinical trials in children and adolescents,” according to a December paper.

Many experts are optimistic that vaccines will be authorized for children as solid data comes in. “I think a good antibody response — with a good safety profile — in kids will be sufficient to have a vaccine candidate licensed,” said Frenck, who has worked on the Pfizer vaccine trials of 12- to 15-year-olds.

Omer agrees. “You don’t have to complete the trial. Even initial preliminary data may suffice.”

But it is still unclear if most children under the age of 16 will be able to be vaccinated before the start of the next school year. And the order in which children will be eligible for an approved vaccine will likely follow the sequence of trials, with adolescents coming first. “If we can at least get down to the older kids, it would be great,” Campbell says.

One big question still hangs in the balance about the utility of vaccinating all children, however. A lot of the impetus to vaccinate children has been not just to reduce incidence of the disease in that group but also to reduce kids’ role in spreading the disease. However, we still don’t have thorough information on how well the vaccines do this.

Early data suggests the vaccines might reduce the rate at which people carry the virus without getting sick. But we are still waiting for more details from the adult studies. “The most likely scenario is that you’re going to get the best protection against the most severe disease, 95 percent protection against all disease, and slightly lower protection against all infection,” Campbell says. (This thinking also helped inform the CDC’s March guidelines for fully vaccinated people.)

Even this level of protection, however, could go a long way in improving children’s lives — and those of their parents. It could allow them to much more safely play with friends and participate in more normal activities.

What should we do before a Covid-19 vaccine is available for kids?

Covid-19 continues to spread, with new worrying upticks in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in several regions across the country. And kids remain vulnerable to getting the illness and to spreading it to others of any age.

So instead of having chickenpox-style Covid-19 exposure parties for kids, which can be dangerous, public health experts advocate continued vigilance against the virus. The CDC recommends children follow similar guidelines to unvaccinated adults. They should wash their hands frequently, avoid or limit contact with unvaccinated people outside their household, avoid those at high risk for the illness, wear a mask in public starting at age 2, have high-touch surfaces and toys disinfected frequently, and avoid unnecessary travel.

But with the early encouraging news from the first Covid-19 vaccine kids trial, we have more reason to expect shots for kids will be coming.

In the meantime, there’s no time to waste in helping prepare pediatricians and families for the vaccines’ arrival for kids, Campbell says. A January survey by the National Parents Union found that only about 35 percent of parents would immediately immunize their children against the disease, and almost a quarter would not get the shots for them at all. If a vast number of kids aren’t vaccinated, they could become a reservoir for the virus, spurring future outbreaks.

But Campbell is hopeful that time and experience will help resolve some of this reluctance. By the time these shots are available for kids, in addition to strong results from pediatric studies, he hopes many of the current questions and wariness around the new vaccines will also be soothed by the months of success in adults.

2021-01-24 11:00:43+00:00,37,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate.

Share All sharing options for: Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new Covid-19 variants, in 2 charts

A more contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is a deadlier one. Not because it gets any individual sicker but because it reaches more people. More illness means more cases: more mild cases, more severe cases, more long-term complications, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.

There’s no one perfect estimate for how much more contagious the SARS-CoV-2 variant called B.1.1.7, which was first discovered in the UK, might be. There needs to be more careful lab work done in animals to nail it down, which could take a few more weeks. But preliminary estimates find it to be between 30 percent and 70 percent more contagious. This variant is now popping up all over the world: in the US, throughout Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere. It’s especially concerning, considering that, in the US and elsewhere, the pandemic’s spread is still reaching new heights.

There’s also a variant called 501Y.V2 that was first found in South Africa; it appears less widespread than B.1.1.7, but also to be more contagious than older variants. It’s still possible that other more transmissible variants will emerge in the future. Scientists just don’t know.

Regardless of exactly how transmissible any new variant is, any possible increase in transmissibility is extremely concerning to epidemiologists and others in public health. It means now, more than ever, our collective and individual actions to stop the spread are critically important.

Here are a few key reasons why.

A more transmissible virus simply means more cases

The reason for concern over a more contagious variant of the virus is simple. “Once it [the variant] becomes common, it will accelerate transmission considerably,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a press call. Accelerated transmission means more cases.

That’s because the virus grows exponentially. Any increase in its inherent transmissibility causes an increasingly high number of cases down the line, if control measures don’t also accelerate to keep up.

With a 50 percent increase in infectiousness, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch says. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” It could be higher, he says.

A more transmissible virus means we need to work harder to stop the spread

Epidemiologists think about the transmissibility of a virus with a figure called R, or the basic reproduction number. This describes how many new cases, on average, will follow one case of the virus.

In the beginning of the outbreak, before the world sprang into action, epidemiologists estimated the R to be around 2 or 3. Since then, thanks to our (inconsistently implemented) efforts — mask-wearing, social distancing, business closures, etc — the R has been reduced in many states to around 1.1 to 1.2. But as long as the R figure is greater than 1, the virus can spread exponentially.

Let’s say a community has gotten its R value down to 1. Then a 50 percent more transmissible variant comes along. It could mean that the same mitigation effort that got the old variant of the virus down to 1 now only gets it down to 1.5.

Which is to say: To combat a more transmissible version of the virus, communities need even more stringent controls.

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Let’s say a community has the virus more or less under control. The R value in the area is 1, which means the number of cases in the area remains constant, month to month.

In this scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, and you’ll have 1,000 cases a month from now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes it takes about five days for one infection to cause another). “Now let’s imagine the virus is 50 percent more transmissible. .... 1,000 cases of such a virus now would translate to more than 10,000 cases a month from now if you did nothing!”

A more transmissible virus increases the number of people who need to be vaccinated

A more transmissible virus also increases the threshold for herd immunity, or the rough estimate of the percentage of people in a population who need to achieve immunity, ideally via a vaccination, in order for the outbreak to decrease in size.

Herd immunity thresholds are dependent on the value of R. The higher the R value, the higher the threshold. If a more transmissible variant becomes dominant the world over, it increases pressure on vaccination campaigns to vaccinate even more people. Already, it’s looking like upward of 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to achieve herd immunity (though the exact figure needed is unknown). That’s already an extremely high and difficult bar to clear, given the slow early distribution of the vaccines.

There’s also the yet-to-be-realized possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that reduces the efficacy of the current vaccines.

A more transmissible virus means more death

One good piece of news about the B.1.1.7 variant: So far, it doesn’t seem to be any deadlier than older variants of the virus. That is: Any individual who gets it isn’t any more likely to end up in the hospital or die, according to the early data.

But more infections mean more death. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Switzerland, says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

A 50 percent more contagious virus is even a deadlier concern than one that’s 50 percent more deadly, as London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains on Twitter.

If a city has an R value of 1.1 and there are 10,000 people infected, in one month’s time, you’d expect to see 129 deaths, he says.

Increase the deadliness of the virus by 50 percent in that scenario and you’d expect 193 deaths — a 49.6 percent increase.

Increase the contagiousness of the virus in this scenario by 50 percent and you get 978 deaths, Kucharski finds. That’s a 658 percent increase. That’s a theoretical calculation, but the central point is the exponential effect, as Kucharski explains.

The above is just an illustrative example, but the key message: an increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity). 5/5 — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) December 28, 2020

It’s not entirely clear if this will come to pass

Again, the estimate of 50 percent increased transmissibility is just an estimate. And even if new variants are more transmissible, it could be hard to predict how much more transmissible it will be in different locations.

Hanage stresses that the 50 percent more transmissible figure being reported is based on how this variant behaves in the UK. In a different place — with different adherences to social distancing, different mitigation measures in place — the new variant could behave differently. It’s complicated, yes, but that’s outbreaks for you.

But even the hypothetical threat of a more transmissible variant is a call for action.

To stop more mutations from happening, to stop more potentially problematic variants from popping up, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, told me in a December interview. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

The new variant mean our individual actions matter more than ever. This variant spreads in the same manner as other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the same precautions apply. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and ventilation are as important as ever.

With the new variant around, Lipsitch says, “Your isolation and quarantine and contact tracing is considerably more important, even more than it was before. So you’re doing more for the world.”",voxdotcom,"['r', 'epidemiologists', 'means', 'thats', 'virus', 'covid19', 'worried', 'charts', 'variant', '50', 'variants', 'transmissible', 'cases', 'number']",0
2021-01-23 16:49:33+00:00,63,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

2021-01-23 15:03:23+00:00,17,"The broadcast journalist Larry King, known for his in-depth interviews and signature style, has died at age 87. His production company, Ora Media, announced King’s death in a statement posted to Twitter Saturday morning.

King died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to the Twitter statement. A cause of death was not given. King had been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms in December 2020.

King hosted Larry King Live on CNN for 25 years. More recently, he hosted Larry King Now and Politicking with Larry King on Hulu and RT America. These were produced by Ora TV, which he co-founded with the Mexican billionaire investor Carlos Slim.

“For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry’s many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,” reads the statement. “Larry always viewed his interview subjects as the true stars of his programs, and himself as merely an unbiased conduit between the guest and audience.”

King became iconic for his preferred interview style: long exchanges in which he asked straightforward questions in a raspy Brooklyn accent. According to a CNN remembrance broadcast Saturday morning, King interviewed more than 50,000 people across 60 years, including US presidents, world leaders, celebrities, athletes, and more esoteric people like psychics, conspiracy theorists, and those convicted of crimes.

And he was perhaps equally known for his bold sartorial choices — he was rarely seen without his signature suspenders, often paired with a bright shirt and colorful necktie.

King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger to Jewish immigrant parents in 1933 in Brooklyn, New York; he began his career in radio. After changing his name, King worked first in local markets in the Miami area, before joining a national radio broadcast with the now-defunct Mutual Broadcasting System in 1978. The Larry King Show aired there until 1994.

In 1985, he joined CNN and launched Larry King Live, a show that made him a household name and regularly had a viewership of over a million people per night.

Guests on that show frequently made news. Oprah Winfrey called on then-Sen. Barack Obama to run for president on King’s program in 2006. And in 1992, the billionaire Ross Perot said in an interview with King that he would run for president if his supporters could land him on the ballot in all 50 states. Perot went on to run upstart populist campaigns in both 1992 and 1996.

The final broadcast of Larry King Live took place on December 10, 2010. King launched Ora TV in 2012.

Over the years, he was married eight times to seven women, and had five children. Two of his children died in August of 2020. King was unmarried at the time of his death.

He also had health issues, including quintuple heart bypass surgery following a heart attack in 1987. More recently, he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous lung tumor in 2017, and had a stroke in 2019 that left him occasionally using a wheelchair.

Nevertheless, he pledged never to retire.

On Twitter, fellow broadcasters and other supporters paid tribute to King as news of his death spread.

2021-01-23 13:57:37+00:00,8,"President Joe Biden isn’t waiting for Congress to start enacting his policy agenda. His presidency is beginning with an aggressive first 10 days in the Oval Office with a suite of executive orders and actions.

The promised actions span from the substantive to more symbolic. Some repeal key parts of former President Donald Trump’s agenda; others lay the groundwork for some of Biden’s own progressive promises.

On his first day, Biden will sign 17 executive initiatives. He’ll mandate masks on federal property. He’ll rescind Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. He’ll extend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums as well as a student loan pause. He’ll take multiple actions on global warming, including rejoining the Paris agreement. He’ll move on immigration, reversing Trump’s travel ban and stopping construction of a wall at the US-Mexico border. He’ll reinforce commitments to racial equity and nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people. And more.

Biden’s team emphasized in a call with reporters that these day-one actions were only the start. A memo from White House chief of staff Ron Klain outlined Biden’s plans to tackle “four overlapping and compounding crises”: Covid-19, the economy, global warming, and racial justice. Short of congressional action, Biden will sign “dozens of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies” to address those areas and more.

“In the coming days and weeks we will be announcing additional executive actions that confront these challenges and deliver on the President-elect’s promises to the American people, including revoking the ban on military service by transgender Americans, and reversing the Mexico City policy,” spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement on Tuesday.

There are limits to what Biden can do through executive actions. Addressing some issues — including the most immediate crises of Covid-19 and the economy — will require more money. Biden will need Congress to approve that. While Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package (which includes a $400 billion Covid-19 plan), Democrats hold only the slimmest majorities in Congress, and it’s unclear yet if policymakers will approve a proposal with such a high price tag.

Biden’s executive actions, in part, acknowledge that reality, and ensure that he’ll be able to claim some movement in his first few days as the hard work of getting legislation through Congress gets started.

Some of the moves will also have an immediate impact — helping millions of Americans who would struggle to pay rent and student loans, providing some relief to undocumented immigrants, and shifting the country toward combating climate change.

The scope of the actions is a reflection of Biden running on one of the most progressive agendas in history. But it’s also an acknowledgment that Democrats didn’t perform well enough in congressional races to fully implement that agenda. Now Biden will need to use his more limited executive powers to fill some of the gaps between his campaign promises and hard political realities.

What Biden’s executive actions do

Biden will take a range of executive actions quickly, simultaneously aiming to move the nation past the Trump era, address pressing crises, and fulfill campaign promises. The full details can be read in a fact sheet and memo, but here are some of the bigger components:

Action on Covid-19 : Biden will impose masking and physical distancing requirements on federal property — part of his “100-Days Masking Challenge” to get Americans to wear masks. He’ll move to rejoin the World Health Organization, following Trump’s decision to withdraw from the group. He’ll create a position of Covid-19 response coordinator and reestablish the National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, an executive team that Trump disbanded that handled pandemic response. More action is reportedly coming, including efforts to expand testing and set up “clear public health standards” regarding Covid-19.

Economic relief : Biden will ask federal agencies to extend federal moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures through at least March 31, which will likely help millions of Americans. He’ll also extend a pause on interest and principal payments for direct federal student loans through at least September 30. And Biden vowed to direct his Cabinet “to take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families bearing the brunt of this crisis.”

Biden will also sign an order reversing a wide range of Trump’s actions on climate change and taking new actions of his own. Included in that list: directing federal agencies to revise vehicle fuel economy and emission standards, imposing a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and revoking the Keystone XL pipeline permit. Biden’s team also promised further action in the coming weeks “with the urgency the science demands.”

Biden will reinforce Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which has provided legal protections to the children of undocumented immigrants. He’ll also reverse Trump’s travel ban, rescind Trump’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, and move to stop construction of the border wall, among other steps. With Biden already proposing legislation to reform the immigration system, this is an area he’ll certainly come back to in the future.

Rejecting bigotry: Biden will sign an executive order establishing that “advancing equity for all … is the responsibility of the whole of our government,” directing federal agencies to act on that principle. The order will also rescind Trump’s 1776 Commission and limits on diversity and inclusion training within federal agencies. Separately, Biden will sign an order that acknowledges the ban on sex-based discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, including in federal agencies.

Improving government’s function: Biden will sign an order requiring “every appointee in the executive branch to sign an ethics pledge” and aiming to “ensure that executive branch employees act in the interest of the American people and not for personal gain,” building on similar action by former President Barack Obama. He’ll also pull back Trump-era rules on establishing new regulations while directing the director of the Office of Management and Budget to improve the regulatory review process. And he’ll issue a regulatory freeze to give his administration time to review new regulations imposed during Trump’s final days.

Much of the executive actions are focused on reversing Trump’s legacy, especially on his iconic issue of immigration. From the travel ban to the border wall, Trump did a lot on this topic that Biden and Democrats opposed. But because much of it was tied to executive instead of congressional actions, a new president has the chance to undo the bulk of that work.

Biden’s team emphasized more is to come — particularly to make it easier in the coming months and years to claim asylum in the US, which Trump made much more difficult in his years in office.

But Biden will also take a slew of actions that essentially build on Obama’s presidency. On climate change, for example, Biden’s moves to rejoin the Paris agreement and bring back rules first imposed by Obama start where the last Democratic administration finished. Climate change remains a top issue among Democrats, so this is a logical area, politically, for Biden to focus some proactive energy on.

And some of the actions simply address the most pressing issues of the day, particularly Covid-19 and the economic crisis.

Still, these actions are limited. They stand to provide some relief to millions of Americans and make other improvements here and there, but they won’t come close to solving any of the continuing and compounding crises that Biden’s team has acknowledged. That will take an act of Congress — and likely weeks, months, or years of work.

Biden is doing what he can for now

Although he was widely considered the moderate option in the Democratic presidential primary, Biden ultimately ran a very progressive campaign once he won the nomination. From economic inequality to health care to global warming, Biden promised a big shift to the left on a host of issues. As Matt Yglesias wrote for Vox, “His platform is in many ways a surprisingly progressive approach to policy that the left sees as a triumph of their own work in trying to change the terms of debate in American politics.”

Progressive hopes were largely dashed on Election Day 2020 when Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives and didn’t take control of the Senate. Some of those hopes were rekindled by the Georgia runoffs, which handed Democrats a razor-thin majority in the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. But with such a slim majority, and moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ) effectively setting the limits of the Democratic agenda, there’s a ceiling to how far Biden will be able to go.

That doesn’t mean Biden has given up. He’s already proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, including a $400 billion Covid-19 plan, and a comprehensive immigration reform bill. He’s spoken about finding common ground with Republicans — which would defy the polarized trends of the last few presidential administrations but would give Biden some wiggle room to get more done.

The reality, though, is this is going to be a tough political environment for the sweeping agenda that Biden ran on. There’s likely to be action on some of the more pressing issues, particularly Covid-19 and that stimulus plan. But more controversial actions, particularly those that can’t pass the Senate with a simple majority as tax-and-spend measures, seem less likely, such as building on the Affordable Care Act, a minimum wage hike, democratic reform, sweeping action on climate change, or significant criminal justice legislation.

Turning to executive actions is a way for the Biden White House to hit the ground running. But it’s also a reflection of that broader political reality.",voxdotcom,"['actions', 'explained', 'federal', 'hell', 'biden', 'firstday', 'covid19', 'flurry', 'executive', 'agencies', 'bidens', 'action', 'sign', 'trumps']",0
2021-01-23 11:01:43+00:00,9,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2021-01-22 16:30:49+00:00,12,"As President Biden settles into the Oval Office, his immediate challenge is fixing America’s botched vaccine rollout.

The current vaccine campaign is not going well. Former President Donald Trump and his administration promised to get 20 million Americans vaccinated and 40 million doses out by the end of 2020. Three weeks into the new year, the country hasn’t reached either goal, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I’ve talked to a lot of experts over the past few weeks about what’s going wrong. They caution that a massive vaccine campaign was always going to be difficult, including in the US. But they point to one major thing Biden can do that Trump didn’t: bring the full powers of the federal government to bear on the issue.

While the Trump administration bought millions of vaccine doses and sent them to states, its efforts by and large stopped there. A Trump official characterized more support as an “invasion” of the states. State and local groups asked for $8 billion for vaccine efforts, but Trump’s White House gave a paltry $340 million. (Congress authorized $8 billion in the stimulus deal passed in late December.)

Based on my conversations with experts, Biden will need to do three key things to fill the leadership void:

1) Address “last mile” problems. The issues slowing down vaccination right now — equipment breaking down, long lines, and insufficient staffing at vaccination sites — come from what experts call the “last mile” of the supply chain, when vaccines go from storage to shots in arms.

The problems vary from place to place, so Biden will need to work closely with local and state officials and private organizations to solve them. One idea from Nada Sanders at Northeastern University is a “backward scheduling” system: Set a vaccination goal for each locale, then work backward to see what plans and resources are needed, and what potential bottlenecks must be addressed, to achieve that goal.

2) Be vigilant about new supply problems. Especially as the vaccine rollout expands, new problems on the supply side, such as insufficient vaccine doses, are likely — that’s part of handling a complex supply chain. The Biden administration needs to work closely with local, state, and private organizations to make sure it catches these problems early.

3) Persuade more Americans to get vaccinated. Based on public opinion surveys, at least one-quarter of Americans are hesitant about getting a vaccine. And to reach herd immunity, 70-plus percent of Americans must get vaccinated. That’s cutting it pretty close. A federal awareness and education campaign could close the gap. If that doesn’t work, the government might need to push people to get vaccinated through financial incentives, or even a mandate.

All three steps require more communication. The Trump administration was wildly inconsistent and even contradictory in its messaging, and that’s a big reason the US has struggled so much with Covid-19 in general. A Biden administration can, at the very least, make its messaging and guidance more consistent.

A lot of this is simply what you’d expect from the federal government during a national crisis. But Trump didn’t do it.

Biden has already promised to do more: He’s announced a $400 billion Covid-19 plan and a vaccine plan, vowing to release and produce more vaccine doses, send more support to states, build mass vaccination centers, and use mobile units to reach undercovered areas. He wants 100 million shots in his first 100 days, enough for 50 million people — though some experts now say that’s not enough.

If he gets this right, Americans could be getting back to normal sooner. If not, the country’s Covid-19 crisis could drag on, with each day bringing thousands more preventable deaths.

2021-01-22 12:30:07+00:00,8,"One of President Joe Biden’s most pressing tasks is speeding up America’s Covid-19 vaccination efforts.

Vaccines are the US’s way out of the pandemic. But the vast majority of Americans — perhaps 70 percent or more, though we don’t know for sure — will have to be inoculated to reach herd immunity or protect at least most of the population. That means vaccinating hundreds of millions of people.

The US isn’t on track to do that quickly. Former President Donald Trump’s administration aimed to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020. Three weeks into 2021, slightly more than 15 million have gotten at least one dose. The Trump administration resisted a more hands-on approach that could get the process moving faster, while other countries that acted quickly have been able to surpass or catch up to the US.

As part of his $400 billion Covid-19 proposal and national vaccine plan, Biden has promised 100 million shots in 100 days, enough to fully vaccinate 50 million people with the two-shot vaccine. But to achieve — and hopefully exceed, as some experts say is needed — that goal, he’ll have to solve problems with the vaccine distribution chain’s “last mile”: from storage and distribution facilities to actual patients. That requires more federal support and coordination to help state and local governments and health care facilities work through staffing, scheduling, equipment, and other concerns.

In the coming months, as vaccine distribution expands to a wider population, new issues are certain to arise. While not all of these are foreseeable, experts say there are ways to at least plan for addressing them quickly: establishing backup plans, staying in close communication with vaccinators on the ground, constantly surveilling the supply chain’s many moving parts to clear bottlenecks as they come up, and creating a public education campaign to convince more skeptical Americans.

All of this was bound to be difficult from the start. Experts have repeatedly noted that, given both its size and urgency, this will be the biggest vaccination campaign in US history. Some have compared the work it requires to that of the New Deal or World War II. There will be serious challenges and, inevitably, mistakes.

But tens of thousands of lives are at stake. More than 400,000 people have died in the US from Covid-19 — a death rate that, when controlled for population, is more than 2.5 times that of neighboring Canada. With more than 3,000 people on average dying of Covid-19 each day, every day that passes without mass vaccinations means another day on which thousands of lives are likely lost.

Saving those lives begins with Biden embracing his new powers of the presidency.

Biden must fill the void of federal leadership

Trump never offered much leadership on the pandemic, with his administration seemingly opposed to a much larger federal role from the beginning. When asked about a more hands-on federal approach to vaccines, Brett Giroir, Trump’s assistant secretary at HHS, compared the idea to a federal invasion: “The federal government doesn’t invade Texas or Montana and provide shots to people.”

No one is talking about the Army taking over the Texas Capitol to forcibly administer vaccines. What’s needed, experts say, is for the federal government to provide more communication, guidance, coordination, and support, especially when states ask for it.

That begins with the “last mile” of the vaccine supply chain. It’s at this point, as vaccines go from a storage facility to patients, that things appear to have fallen apart in the US. Freezers broke down in California. People in West Virginia mistakenly got an experimental Covid-19 treatment instead of a vaccine. Seniors in Florida waited in long lines to get their shot. Health care workers in New York tried to cheat the system to jump ahead in line.

Across the country, facilities have complained they don’t have the staff to administer the doses they have, as health care workers deal with a surge of Covid-19 patients and workers of all kinds fall sick themselves. Others have said it’s impossible to plan ahead because they often don’t know how many doses or what type of vaccine they’re getting from the feds until the day the shipment arrives.

The Trump administration suggested it wasn’t responsible for fixing these problems: It sent the vaccine doses to states, and it was on the states to distribute those doses from there.

But there are some things the federal government could do, said Nada Sanders, a distinguished professor of supply chain management at Northeastern University. One is called “backward scheduling”: The Biden administration could partner with states to set a goal for how many people to vaccinate and then work backward, going from injecting the vaccine to the factory where the dose was produced in order to figure out what’s needed at every step. This won’t anticipate every single problem, but it will at least give officials a way to prepare.

Bottlenecks “can and will occur,” Sanders told me. “It is just part of managing a supply chain. That is why it must be monitored in real time and bottlenecks addressed as they are forming, well before they become acute.”

As distribution expands, more of these supply bottlenecks will pop up. Already, there have been reports of shortages of dry ice, small glass vials, and materials for vaccine doses. The Trump administration missed its own goal of 40 million doses to states by the end of 2020, and was still millions short three weeks into January.

As we saw with Covid-19 testing, fixing these initial problems won’t solve everything for good. When one part of the supply chain is fixed, growing capacity enables more demand along other parts of the chain, leading to new bottlenecks popping up.

The idea is to be ready for these problems and to use federal tools — such as the Defense Production Act, which can be used to boost production of needed materials — to smooth out issues as they arise. It also means working with flexibility and adaptability, given that unexpected problems can come up at any time.

In some cases, the feds will need to provide direct resources to local and state governments. This is another area in which the Trump administration fell short: State groups spent months lobbying for $8 billion to build out vaccine infrastructure, but the administration gave them only $340 million. It wasn’t until late December, when Congress and Trump passed a second stimulus package, that the federal government finally allocated the billions states had asked for.

Even that came too late. States really needed the money to plan for vaccination efforts before they were underway, and some state officials say they need even more now that they’re actually dealing with a messy rollout.

The Biden administration will also eventually have to convince people to get vaccinated, including some of the roughly quarter of Americans who are hesitant. That will require a large public education and awareness campaign, and probably some creativity and help from others — for instance, maybe having Taylor Swift or LeBron James get vaccinated on camera. Trump doing the same could help persuade his supporters, many of whom tend to be more skeptical about needing a vaccine. The US won’t be able to convince everyone to get a shot, but 100 percent compliance isn’t needed for herd immunity and sufficient protection.

Biden has already promised much of this in his Covid-19 proposal and vaccine plan, which include more support to states and proposals for mass vaccination centers and mobile units. The question now is how and whether these things are actually implemented.

This isn’t going to be easy, but it’s possible

The current mishaps with the vaccine rollout are particularly concerning because this was supposed to be the easier part. The first groups getting vaccinated were relatively easy to target — officials should know where health care workers and nursing home residents are and have medical staff nearby. With vaccine allowances now expanding to more individuals in further-flung places, vaccination campaigns stand to get much harder.

“I thought the first month would go smoothly, and then we’d hit the big crash as the decisions became more complex,” Julie Swann, a vaccine distribution expert at North Carolina State University, told me.

Experts have warned all along that the later parts of the US’s Covid-19 vaccine campaign would be an especially massive, complicated undertaking. We don’t yet know all of the problems that will arise in the coming months as more and more vaccines are distributed. “Ultimately, it is difficult to give [vaccines] out and prioritize it for a population,” Swann said.

But other countries have shown it can be done better. Israel is vaccinating people at seven times the rate of the US, and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and United Kingdom are also ahead of the US. Countries that got a later start than America on vaccines, like Denmark and Ireland, are rapidly catching up.

Mathematically, the current campaign simply isn’t quick enough. At the current rate of 900,000 vaccinations per day, it would take into the fall or winter and possibly 2022 to reach what experts believe could be herd immunity for Covid-19. Many experts have called for finishing the vaccine campaign this summer, before the next school year, a possible fall surge, and another dangerous mutation of the virus. A months-longer undertaking could result in tens of thousands more deaths.

There’s no reason the US, as the wealthiest country in the world, should uniquely struggle so much with this. The country has done big vaccination campaigns before — every year with flu shots, in fact — and it’s how America eradicated diseases such as smallpox, polio, and measles within its borders. It’s not easy, but it’s absolutely possible.

The key, though, is to leverage the powers of the federal government. Throughout the pandemic, America’s biggest failures have occurred when the federal government was slow to act or didn’t act at all. That was true with personal protective equipment for health care workers, as the Trump administration refused to make greater use of tools like the Defense Production Act. It was true for testing, as the administration described itself as a “supplier of last resort” and left state, local, and private actors to handle the bulk of the work. And it’s now true for vaccines, as Trump’s White House refused to get more involved.

This is a national crisis. Every state has far too many Covid-19 cases, based on Vox’s tracker of state epidemics. Every state is failing to vaccinate its people quickly enough — few have administered more than 70 percent of their dose supply. We need national solutions for this.

As Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, wrote in the Washington Post, “For all this pandemic has taught us and cost us, it has demonstrated again that we are the United States and, especially in crisis, an effective federal government is essential.”

This is Biden’s promise, both on the campaign trail and in his Covid-19 plan: He’ll push a bigger role for the federal government. He now has a chance to show the idea can work. Lives depend on it.

2021-01-21 21:00:10+00:00,26,"President Joe Biden already announced a $400 billion Covid-19 plan as part of his $1.9 trillion economic relief proposal. But while he waits for Congress to act on those proposals, Biden is taking a dozen executive actions to tackle the US’s most pressing public health crisis.

Behind the executive actions is Biden’s “National Strategy for the Covid-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness,” announced Thursday. The plan aims to restore public trust, scale up vaccination, expand testing and masking, reopen schools and businesses safely, and more — all with an eye on equity in terms of race, ethnicity, and urban-rural divides.

The Biden team emphasized that it’ll need Congress — particularly for funding — as well as state, local, and private actors to fully implement the plan. But Biden is doing what he can for now.

The bulk of these actions will come on Thursday, Biden’s second day in office. He’ll leverage the Defense Production Act to try to make more vaccines, tests, and protective equipment such as masks. He’ll establish a pandemic testing board in order to expand testing supplies, access, and the public health workforce. He’ll provide guidance to help schools and businesses reopen safely. He’s directing the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to start establishing community vaccination centers. And that’s just for starters.

Those actions follow on Biden’s more limited first-day executive actions — requiring masks on federal property, committing the US to rejoin the World Health Organization, and creating (or reestablishing) federal positions and agencies to handle Covid-19 and broader disease outbreak response.

Biden’s first- and second-day actions are on top of the plans his team released last week, including a $400 billion Covid-19 plan that will require Congress’s approval and a national vaccine plan.

The steps vary in their significance, from the more symbolic to the more substantial. A mask mandate on federal property won’t affect much of the population, but it signals that the government takes this issue seriously. At the same time, the federal government supporting and building mass vaccination centers could really help get Covid-19 vaccines out to many more Americans — helping end this pandemic sooner, if it’s done correctly.

More broadly, the national plan and executive actions mark a clear shift from the previous administration. President Donald Trump generally took a hands-off approach to the pandemic — leaving the bulk of the work on masks, testing, contact tracing, and vaccines on states to figure out. Biden’s plans and actions signal that’s going to change, starting immediately.

It comes at a crucial time. As America’s Covid-19 vaccine campaign continues to falter, the country is experiencing some of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world. Whether Biden fixes all of this could decide the trajectory of his presidency — and may help prevent potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of more American deaths.

What Biden’s plan and executive actions will do

For much of the past year, a major complaint from experts was that there was no national plan for Covid-19. To the extent any plan was communicated at all, it’s that Trump and his administration didn’t see a larger federal role in response to the pandemic — such as when the Trump administration put forward an outline describing the federal government as merely a “supplier of last resort” on testing.

Now Biden is releasing a national plan. It’s a broad outline, but the general idea is that the federal government should take a more hands-on strategy: providing reliable guidance to the public; proactively supplying states with the resources they need to test, contact trace, and vaccinate; taking a stronger global role on pandemic response; and emphasizing equity in all aspects of the administration’s work.

At the top of the agenda is the overarching goal: 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. Some experts argue that goal doesn’t go far enough; it’s only a bit faster than the current vaccination rate of about 900,000 shots a day. Biden’s team says this is only the start of a process that will span months.

Biden’s team repeatedly acknowledged to reporters that they’ll need Congress’s support to get all of this done, including meeting the administration’s vaccination goal. But Biden is trying to get the ball rolling with a suite of executive actions that, in the administration’s view, chip away at some of the current gaps in the federal response.

Here are some of the major points of Biden’s executive actions:

More vaccines: The Biden administration is taking a series of actions to boost the distribution of vaccines: FEMA will build vaccination centers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will launch a new federal pharmacy program, and states will have new “Covid Response Liaisons to foster more cooperation, similar to those used during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Leverage the Defense Production Act: Whether it’s for testing or vaccines, supply chains have repeatedly broken down during America’s response to Covid-19. Biden has promised to fix that, leveraging a federal law known as the Defense Production Act to prioritize and boost the production and distribution of supplies that are necessary to combat the virus.

Biden has promised to fix that, leveraging a federal law known as the Defense Production Act to prioritize and boost the production and distribution of supplies that are necessary to combat the virus. Reimburse states for some personnel and supplies: With the economy still weak, states and local governments have seen revenues drop throughout the pandemic, leaving them unable to pay for all they need to combat Covid-19. The Biden administration has promised a bit of relief by offering to reimburse states through FEMA for the use of the National Guard and some supplies.

Improve data collection and sharing: Local and state officials have complained they often don’t know how many vaccine doses they’re getting from the federal government and when. Biden will try to ameliorate that through an executive order and other actions trying to improve data collection and sharing with all levels of government and the broader public.

New federal roles for pandemic response: Biden created a new position of Covid-19 response coordinator, who “will report directly to the President and be responsible for coordinating all elements of the COVID-19 response across government.” And he reestablished the National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which will oversee, in part, pandemic response for the White House.

Rejoining the World Health Organization: Biden also rescinded Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization, promising to rejoin and help reform the group. Anthony Fauci will attend the organization’s January 21 meeting while acting as head of the delegation.

For more details, the administration has put up fact sheets for its actions on its first and second day.

In part, the actions undo some of Trump’s moves. That’s most obviously true for rejoining the WHO. But it’s also true for the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which the Trump administration disbanded before the Covid-19 outbreak; Obama’s administration had set up the team after the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa to help the country prepare for future disease threats.

The actions also signal Biden’s broader agenda on Covid-19. He’s pushing against the limits of his executive powers to boost the production of vaccines, tests, and other supplies in a fight against Covid-19. He’s also effectively created a Covid-19 czar role to oversee future efforts.

It’s part of a more involved approach to Covid-19 than Trump took. That also includes potential legislation, which will have to be passed by Congress, pumping $400 billion into Covid-19 efforts — like a boosted vaccine campaign, scaled-up Covid-19 testing, and a new public health workforce of 100,000.

Biden’s executive actions lay some of the groundwork toward actually achieving what he’s promised on Covid-19. The questions now are if he will succeed — and if it will be enough to turn around one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks.

Biden is embracing a bigger federal role on Covid-19

Underlying Biden’s plans on Covid-19 is a concept that the Trump administration rejected: a larger federal role to fight the coronavirus.

To that end, none of what Biden is proposing is new or particularly radical. They’re the kinds of things that experts have been putting forward for a year now. They’re in many ways what one would expect the federal government to do in response to a disease outbreak — indeed, some of the steps Biden has taken simply revive policies from past administrations.

But the Trump administration rejected more aggressive steps on Covid-19. Whether it was protective equipment, testing, or contact tracing, Trump and his team repeatedly insisted that the federal government would only play a supplemental role to the states. Trump never came up with anything resembling a national plan on Covid-19, pushing the states to do the bulk of the heavy lifting.

As Trump’s last days in office counted down, that culminated in a messy vaccine rollout. While there are many factors contributing to America’s slow vaccine efforts — including the country’s size, sprawl, and segmented health care system — a key contributor is the lack of federal involvement. In effect, the Trump administration purchased tens of millions of doses of the vaccines, shipped them to the states, and then left the states to figure out the rest.

This was clear in the funding numbers. State organizations asked for $8 billion to build up vaccine infrastructure. The Trump administration provided $340 million. Only in December did Congress finally approve $8 billion for vaccine distribution, but experts say that money comes late, given that vaccination efforts are already well underway and the funds could’ve helped in the preparation stages.

When asked about the botched vaccine rollout, the Trump administration stuck to its anti-federalist stance — arguing that it’s on states and localities to figure out how they can vaccinate more people. Brett Giroir, an administration leader on Covid-19 efforts, argued, “The federal government doesn’t invade Texas or Montana and provide shots to people.”

Characterizing greater federal support for Covid-19 efforts as a federal invasion is absurd, but it’s emblematic of the Trump administration’s approach to the coronavirus as a whole.

That’s what Biden is pushing to change.

Much of Biden’s agenda will require congressional approval — particularly parts that require more money — and it’s possible Congress, now barely held by Democrats, could scoff at a high price tag.

And a lingering question has been how much of the US’s failure on Covid-19 is on Trump and a lack of federal involvement versus longstanding, broader structural problems (not least the country’s fragmented style of government and health care systems). Biden may show that weak federal governance was the problem — or he may not.

It all begins, though, with Biden’s executive actions during his first two days.",voxdotcom,"['fight', 'plan', 'explained', 'federal', 'biden', 'actions', 'administration', 'trump', 'response', 'covid19', 'executive', 'bidens', 'states', 'national', 'pandemic']",0
2021-01-21 19:05:06+00:00,10,"America’s child care providers have hit a breaking point.

In a survey last summer, 86 percent said the Covid-19 pandemic had hurt their enrollment. Seventy percent said it had driven up costs. With less money coming in and more going out, just 18 percent believed they could stay open longer than a year without some kind of help.

Those numbers are just one sign of a crisis that’s been brewing ever since the pandemic began spreading across the US.

With school buildings and daycare centers closed, parents — especially moms, who still shoulder the majority of caregiving responsibilities — struggle to work. Many have been forced to quit their jobs, jeopardizing their ability to provide for their families. Meanwhile, many kids aren’t getting the high-quality care and education they need. And child care providers, who operate on razor-thin margins in the best of times, are being forced to close their doors.

Given all this, experts have long been calling for a bailout of the child care industry to see it through the current crisis and secure it for the future. And now, President Joe Biden has made such a bailout part of his $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to fight the virus and rescue the American economy.

The plan includes $25 billion to help child care providers weather the pandemic and reopen safely, $15 billion in child care assistance for families to help parents get back to work, and an expanded tax credit to help families afford care. Together with the $10 billion set aside in the December stimulus package, the proposal would reach the $50 billion advocates have said is necessary to stabilize the child care industry.

“We were really, really pleased to see the amount of funding in the plan,” Rhian Allvin, CEO of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), told Vox. “It definitely is what we have been asking for.”

But it still has to pass Congress, where Republicans have already cast doubt on Biden’s plan. And even if it succeeds, it’s still only the beginning of the full child care reform that many experts say the country urgently needs.

“The economics of child care were shaky before we even got into pandemic,” Allvin said. “While this will absolutely stabilize the sector, it doesn’t fix the underlying economic conditions that weaken it.”

Biden’s stimulus plan provides the relief child care experts have been calling for

Unveiled last week, Biden’s American Rescue Plan is his opening proposal for the next round of federal stimulus money, as Vox’s Emily Stewart explains. Alongside money for vaccines and testing, reopening schools, and $1,400 checks to Americans, it includes a major investment in child care. The child care portion of the plan includes three main parts:

1) A $25 billion emergency stabilization fund for providers. Child care providers have been squeezed by Covid-19 like never before. The virus and economic crisis have led parents to pull their children out of daycare, resulting in lost revenue, while new social distancing and cleaning requirements have driven costs up. That’s left many providers in danger of closing — in the survey last summer, conducted by NAEYC, two out of five programs said they were certain they would close permanently without public support. The emergency stabilization fund would address the problem by helping providers pay costs rent, utilities, and payroll, so they can weather the challenges of the pandemic without going out of business.

2) An additional $15 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant program (CCDBG). The CCDBG provides federal funding that states can use to improve access to child care. The CARES Act last spring included $3.5 billion for this program and the December stimulus package added another $10 billion. Now, Biden is proposing an additional $15 billion for the program. States could use this money to offer child care subsidies for more families — as Biden’s team notes in a fact sheet on the plan, “millions of parents are risking their lives as essential workers, while at the same time struggling to obtain care for their children.” State governments can also use the CCDBG money to boost the wages and benefits of child care providers, many of whom have been asked to work through a pandemic without health insurance, and while making less than $11 an hour.

3) Expand the child care tax credit. The tax code currently gives taxpayers a credit worth 20 to 35 percent of their care expenses. Biden’s plan would introduce a one-year expansion raising that to 50 percent, up to a total of $4,000 for one child or $8,000 for two or more. The plan would also make the tax credit refundable, so people who don’t owe taxes would still get the money back. Tax credits are an imperfect system for reducing child care expenses, since families get the money all at once rather than when they need it. Still, advocates have called for this expansion as part of a broader package. “We were really pleased to see that,” Allvin said.

Overall, child care experts have praised Biden’s plan, which was formulated in close consultation with advocates. “This is so important and we’re thrilled about it,” Allvin said, calling the plan “a down payment on what we need to do for the system at large.”

Now it needs to get through Congress. Whether that will happen is still somewhat up in the air. Biden will have a Democratic majority in the House and the slimmest of majorities in the Senate, but not enough votes to overcome a filibuster. He has two options: try to get some Senate Republicans on board, or use the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority. Biden and Democrats have said they’ll try the first option before resorting to the second. In either case, the new president may have to make some concessions, both to members of his own party and to Republicans.

Republicans haven’t always supported expanding child care in America — even Joe Biden hasn’t. But advocates believe the pandemic has opened people’s eyes to the necessity of affordable child care — if nothing else, to getting the economy back on track. And some Republicans have been on board with child care relief in recent months. For example, stimulus packages introduced in the fall by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a bipartisan group of lawmakers each included $15 billion in child care funding. And in the summer, a group of Republican senators including Joni Ernst of Iowa introduced a bill to provide grants to help child care providers reopen.

“I’m hopeful that child care will fare well in the negotiations” over the stimulus package, Allvin said.

But even if Biden’s plan passes, it will be only the beginning. Stabilizing the child care system is crucial, but the pandemic has only underscored the fact that this system was broken from the beginning, with families paying more than they can afford and workers making poverty-level wages. In order to truly make child care accessible to all families — and a viable, sustainable career for caregivers and educators — the country will need to spend closer to $140 billion every year, Allvin said.

That’s a lot of money, but it will pay for itself by allowing parents (especially mothers, who have disproportionately dropped out of the labor force to care for children) to get back to work, experts say. Investing in child care also helps workers stay in the profession and build their skills, and it benefits children and the whole country by contributing to better outcomes in adolescence and adulthood, like better high school graduation rates. Every dollar invested in child care can produce up to a $16 return when all the benefits are taken into account, Allvin said.

Last summer, Biden put forth a larger plan to shore up American child care, including increased wages for workers and subsidies to ensure that families spend no more than 7 percent of their income on child care. But as with his stimulus package, it will need to go through Congress. And with two years of a Democratic majority before elections come around again, there will be many legislative priorities competing for attention.

But advocates are hopeful that the experiences of the last 10 months will help move child care nearer the top of the list — and remind Americans and members of Congress of what’s really needed to make high-quality, affordable child care a reality in this country. “We know that there is an enormous investment required,” Allvin said.",voxdotcom,"['plan', 'money', 'allvin', 'includes', '40', 'covid19', 'families', 'child', 'stimulus', 'bidens', 'care', 'providers', 'pandemic', 'billion']",0
2021-01-21 13:51:54+00:00,10,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing.

2021-01-21 10:00:05+00:00,13,"President Joe Biden already announced a $400 billion Covid-19 plan as part of his $1.9 trillion economic relief proposal. But while he waits for Congress to act on those proposals, Biden is taking a dozen executive actions to tackle the US’s most pressing public health crisis.

Behind the executive actions is Biden’s “National Strategy for the Covid-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness,” announced Thursday. The plan aims to restore public trust, scale up vaccination, expand testing and masking, reopen schools and businesses safely, and more — all with an eye on equity in terms of race, ethnicity, and urban-rural divides.

The Biden team emphasized that it’ll need Congress — particularly for funding — as well as state, local, and private actors to fully implement the plan. But Biden is doing what he can for now.

The bulk of these actions will come on Thursday, Biden’s second day in office. He’ll leverage the Defense Production Act to try to make more vaccines, tests, and protective equipment such as masks. He’ll establish a pandemic testing board in order to expand testing supplies, access, and the public health workforce. He’ll provide guidance to help schools and businesses reopen safely. He’s directing the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to start establishing community vaccination centers. And that’s just for starters.

Those actions follow on Biden’s more limited first-day executive actions — requiring masks on federal property, committing the US to rejoin the World Health Organization, and creating (or reestablishing) federal positions and agencies to handle Covid-19 and broader disease outbreak response.

Biden’s first- and second-day actions are on top of the plans his team released last week, including a $400 billion Covid-19 plan that will require Congress’s approval and a national vaccine plan.

The steps vary in their significance, from the more symbolic to the more substantial. A mask mandate on federal property won’t affect much of the population, but it signals that the government takes this issue seriously. At the same time, the federal government supporting and building mass vaccination centers could really help get Covid-19 vaccines out to many more Americans — helping end this pandemic sooner, if it’s done correctly.

More broadly, the national plan and executive actions mark a clear shift from the previous administration. President Donald Trump generally took a hands-off approach to the pandemic — leaving the bulk of the work on masks, testing, contact tracing, and vaccines on states to figure out. Biden’s plans and actions signal that’s going to change, starting immediately.

It comes at a crucial time. As America’s Covid-19 vaccine campaign continues to falter, the country is experiencing some of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world. Whether Biden fixes all of this could decide the trajectory of his presidency — and may help prevent potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of more American deaths.

What Biden’s plan and executive actions will do

For much of the past year, a major complaint from experts was that there was no national plan for Covid-19. To the extent any plan was communicated at all, it’s that Trump and his administration didn’t see a larger federal role in response to the pandemic — such as when the Trump administration put forward an outline describing the federal government as merely a “supplier of last resort” on testing.

Now Biden is releasing a national plan. It’s a broad outline, but the general idea is that the federal government should take a more hands-on strategy: providing reliable guidance to the public; proactively supplying states with the resources they need to test, contact trace, and vaccinate; taking a stronger global role on pandemic response; and emphasizing equity in all aspects of the administration’s work.

At the top of the agenda is the overarching goal: 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. Some experts argue that goal doesn’t go far enough; it’s only a bit faster than the current vaccination rate of about 900,000 shots a day. Biden’s team says this is only the start of a process that will span months.

Biden’s team repeatedly acknowledged to reporters that they’ll need Congress’s support to get all of this done, including meeting the administration’s vaccination goal. But Biden is trying to get the ball rolling with a suite of executive actions that, in the administration’s view, chip away at some of the current gaps in the federal response.

Here are some of the major points of Biden’s executive actions:

More vaccines: The Biden administration is taking a series of actions to boost the distribution of vaccines: FEMA will build vaccination centers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will launch a new federal pharmacy program, and states will have new “Covid Response Liaisons to foster more cooperation, similar to those used during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Leverage the Defense Production Act: Whether it’s for testing or vaccines, supply chains have repeatedly broken down during America’s response to Covid-19. Biden has promised to fix that, leveraging a federal law known as the Defense Production Act to prioritize and boost the production and distribution of supplies that are necessary to combat the virus.

Biden has promised to fix that, leveraging a federal law known as the Defense Production Act to prioritize and boost the production and distribution of supplies that are necessary to combat the virus. Reimburse states for some personnel and supplies: With the economy still weak, states and local governments have seen revenues drop throughout the pandemic, leaving them unable to pay for all they need to combat Covid-19. The Biden administration has promised a bit of relief by offering to reimburse states through FEMA for the use of the National Guard and some supplies.

Biden will set up a board that will attempt to track down what the hold-ups are here and recommend how to fix them.

Improve data collection and sharing: Local and state officials have complained they often don’t know how many vaccine doses they’re getting from the federal government and when. Biden will try to ameliorate that through an executive order and other actions trying to improve data collection and sharing with all levels of government and the broader public.

New federal roles for pandemic response: Biden created a new position of Covid-19 response coordinator, who “will report directly to the President and be responsible for coordinating all elements of the COVID-19 response across government.” And he reestablished the National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which will oversee, in part, pandemic response for the White House.

Rejoining the World Health Organization: Biden also rescinded Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization, promising to rejoin and help reform the group. Anthony Fauci will attend the organization’s January 21 meeting while acting as head of the delegation.

For more details, the administration has put up fact sheets for its actions on its first and second day.

In part, the actions undo some of Trump’s moves. That’s most obviously true for rejoining the WHO. But it’s also true for the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which the Trump administration disbanded before the Covid-19 outbreak; Obama’s administration had set up the team after the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa to help the country prepare for future disease threats.

The actions also signal Biden’s broader agenda on Covid-19. He’s pushing against the limits of his executive powers to boost the production of vaccines, tests, and other supplies in a fight against Covid-19. He’s also effectively created a Covid-19 czar role to oversee future efforts.

It’s part of a more involved approach to Covid-19 than Trump took. That also includes potential legislation, which will have to be passed by Congress, pumping $400 billion into Covid-19 efforts — like a boosted vaccine campaign, scaled-up Covid-19 testing, and a new public health workforce of 100,000.

Biden’s executive actions lay some of the groundwork toward actually achieving what he’s promised on Covid-19. The questions now are if he will succeed — and if it will be enough to turn around one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks.

Biden is embracing a bigger federal role on Covid-19

Underlying Biden’s plans on Covid-19 is a concept that the Trump administration rejected: a larger federal role to fight the coronavirus.

To that end, none of what Biden is proposing is new or particularly radical. They’re the kinds of things that experts have been putting forward for a year now. They’re in many ways what one would expect the federal government to do in response to a disease outbreak — indeed, some of the steps Biden has taken simply revive policies from past administrations.

But the Trump administration rejected more aggressive steps on Covid-19. Whether it was protective equipment, testing, or contact tracing, Trump and his team repeatedly insisted that the federal government would only play a supplemental role to the states. Trump never came up with anything resembling a national plan on Covid-19, pushing the states to do the bulk of the heavy lifting.

As Trump’s last days in office counted down, that culminated in a messy vaccine rollout. While there are many factors contributing to America’s slow vaccine efforts — including the country’s size, sprawl, and segmented health care system — a key contributor is the lack of federal involvement. In effect, the Trump administration purchased tens of millions of doses of the vaccines, shipped them to the states, and then left the states to figure out the rest.

This was clear in the funding numbers. State organizations asked for $8 billion to build up vaccine infrastructure. The Trump administration provided $340 million. Only in December did Congress finally approve $8 billion for vaccine distribution, but experts say that money comes late, given that vaccination efforts are already well underway and the funds could’ve helped in the preparation stages.

When asked about the botched vaccine rollout, the Trump administration stuck to its anti-federalist stance — arguing that it’s on states and localities to figure out how they can vaccinate more people. Brett Giroir, an administration leader on Covid-19 efforts, argued, “The federal government doesn’t invade Texas or Montana and provide shots to people.”

Characterizing greater federal support for Covid-19 efforts as a federal invasion is absurd, but it’s emblematic of the Trump administration’s approach to the coronavirus as a whole.

That’s what Biden is pushing to change.

Much of Biden’s agenda will require congressional approval — particularly parts that require more money — and it’s possible Congress, now barely held by Democrats, could scoff at a high price tag.

And a lingering question has been how much of the US’s failure on Covid-19 is on Trump and a lack of federal involvement versus longstanding, broader structural problems (not least the country’s fragmented style of government and health care systems). Biden may show that weak federal governance was the problem — or he may not.

It all begins, though, with Biden’s executive actions during his first two days.",voxdotcom,"['fight', 'plan', 'explained', 'federal', 'biden', 'actions', 'administration', 'trump', 'response', 'covid19', 'executive', 'bidens', 'states', 'national', 'pandemic']",0
2021-01-20 23:03:04+00:00,13,"When Joe Biden, the former two-term vice president under Barack Obama and 36-year Senate veteran, took the oath of office on January 20, he became the chief executive with the most experience in public service in US history. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, became the first woman, first African American, and first South Asian American to serve as vice president.

The 46th president and his vice president take office amid a world-historic crisis, a pandemic that has already claimed more American lives than US soldiers who died in World War II, and has produced the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression.

As the scale of the pandemic and its economic damage started becoming clear earlier this year, the campaign signaled that Biden wanted an “FDR-sized” administration. And as a result of the surprise Democratic sweep of Georgia’s Senate runoffs earlier this month, Biden has congressional majorities, albeit extremely narrow ones, that could enable him to realize that ambition, or at least come close. He will be able to enact not just sweeping changes through executive action, but major spending bills with the benefit of a Democratic Senate and House.

Biden will preside over the first Democratic “trifecta” since the one he and President Barack Obama led from 2009 to 2011. That trifecta also came to power at a time of crisis. In 2008, the subprime mortgage crisis had grown into a full-blown financial crisis and the largest recession since the 1930s. Obama, Biden, and congressional Democrats pushed through a large (though not large enough) fiscal stimulus package, the Obamacare health reforms, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, the New START arms control treaty with Russia, legislation authorizing the Food and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes, and a repeal of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” ban on gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. They also used those two years to confirm Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

Biden and Harris now have a similar opportunity — and likely the same brief window. Presidents very often lose seats in Congress during the first midterm elections, so Biden and Harris will have to make exceptionally good use of the time between January 20, 2021, and January 3, 2023 (when the next Congress gets seated), to pass their agenda. They will also have to think carefully about priorities when they have a mere 50 senators on their side and any one Senate Democrat could derail an entire bill.

Their campaign promises suggest that time will be busy. They have pledged to implement a plan to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic by expanding testing, fostering better coordination between states, and funding and organizing rapid development and deployment of a vaccine.

They will need to pass their plan to respond to the economic crisis created by the pandemic, with funding for cash-strapped states and localities, cash and unemployment insurance for individuals and households, and grants and loans to keep small businesses like bars and restaurants in business.

They will need to pass their legislative package to prevent the worst effects of man-made climate change, including subsidies for developing and deploying green energy, and plans to expand access to clean energy abroad.

They will also need to decide how to respond to Republican constitutional hardball on the Supreme Court, whether by reforming or actively packing the Court. They will need to agree to a package of democratic reforms, like public financing of elections; requiring all states to use independent commissions to draw congressional districts; and admitting Washington, DC, as a state and holding a binding referendum for Puerto Rican statehood.

And they will need to use these first two years to pass their economic agenda, from enabling all Americans to buy into a Medicare-like public option for health insurance to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour to dramatically expanding subsidies for child care.

As they’re convincing Congress to do all that, they will also need to undo Donald Trump’s reversal of the Obama-Biden foreign policy by reengaging with Cuba and Iran, negotiating a new arms control deal with Russia before New START expires, and addressing the threat North Korea poses to South Korea and Japan.

And they will have to decide how to handle the legacy of their predecessor: whether to let bygones be bygones, as was the Obama-Biden attitude toward George W. Bush, or to seek to prosecute or at least investigate wrongdoing from the Trump years.

Related Joe Biden has a chance to finish the work of Obamacare

The Biden-Harris presidency is an enormous relief to the majority who voted against Trump four years ago, to those harmed by his policies from forced family separation to the botched Covid-19 response, and to the many who worried Trump harbored dangerous autocratic tendencies. To the Americans who elected Biden, it feels like the end of a dark chapter in our nation’s history, and potentially the beginning of a moment of great opportunity.

But for that opportunity to be fulfilled, Biden and Harris will need to work fast, and aggressively. They have no time to waste.

Biden and Harris’s plan to tackle Covid-19

Biden’s first task is to address the Covid-19 disaster, both from the perspective of public health and from the perspective of economic recovery. His agenda to do that, laid out on January 14, is called the American Rescue Plan. It’s a $1.9 trillion agenda that aims to vaccinate 100 million Americans against the virus in Biden’s first 100 days, send out $1,400 checks as part of a trillion dollar-plus stimulus effort, and bolster America’s family benefits in a way that the Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy concluded would cut child poverty in America in half.

The plan includes some $160 billion to accelerate testing and vaccine distribution this spring, on top of what Congress has already authorized under President Trump. Beyond the money, Biden’s vaccine plan is focused on making maximal use of vaccines already produced, accelerating the production of vaccines, and setting up new vaccination sites. Biden announced in a speech that he will encourage states “to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond health care workers and move through these groups as quickly as states think they can. That includes anyone 65 and older.”

He pledged to, on his first day in office, instruct FEMA to set up emergency vaccination centers, aiming to set up at least 100 by February 20, and to ensure all pharmacies across the country are able to distribute the vaccine. He has also promised to invoke the Defense Production Act to accelerate vaccine production, and production of associated materials like tubes and syringes.

Even more money, $170 billion, is set aside to enable schools to safely reopen. Biden’s goal is to reopen all of America’s K-8 schools in his first 100 days. That’s a goal that is in some tension with teachers’ union opposition to fast reopening, but the Biden team argues that reopening is relatively safe for younger grades, and important to ensure kids don’t lose crucial learning months and parents have child care relief. The money, Biden stated in a speech, will enable schools to invest in “more testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems in the schools” to make reopening maximally safe. That was enough to win buy-in from the country’s two leading teacher union federations.

But the bulk of the $1.9 trillion is to be spent on economic relief, intended to go big in an effort to foster a speedier recovery than the nearly decade-long one that followed the 2007-2009 recession. Georgia Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock successfully campaigned on $2,000 checks in their runoff, so Biden includes $1,400 checks (adding up to $2,000 when including the $600 checks passed by Congress in December). That would cost about $465 billion; some Democrats on the left in Congress are already pushing for a full $2,000 in new checks, for a total of $2,600 in relief.

Beyond that, Biden wants to boost the current $300 per week unemployment insurance supplement passed in the December stimulus to $400 per week, and extend it from its current expiration point in mid-March through September. He’d offer another $350 billion to state and local governments facing huge tax revenue shortfalls due to Covid-19 lockdowns and the broader recession. He’d gradually increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. (Normally, this could not pass through the expedited budget process, but incoming Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has signaled he’ll try to use the budget process to pass the wage increase).

And Biden includes a one-year version of the American Family Act, a longstanding Congressional proposal that would expand the current $2,000 child tax credit to $3,000 for older kids and $3,600 for younger ones. This provision accounts for much of the Biden plan’s dramatic anti-poverty impact, according to Columbia researchers.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget think tank summarizes the Biden Covid-19 proposals and their costs in this helpful chart:

The rest of “building back better”

But responding to Covid-19 is only part of Biden’s agenda. He also has an extensive list of other legislation he would like to pass after the economic stimulus plan; much of it is spending legislation that can pass the Senate with only 50 votes.

Biden wants to offer middle-class parents and caretakers $8,000 a year for child or long-term care support, achieve universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, make community college free, forgive the first $10,000 in student loans, guarantee paid family and medical leave, spend $700 billion on manufacturing and R&D to expand jobs in those sectors, and make it easier to organize unions. He has a proposal to make Section 8 housing vouchers an entitlement available to all eligible families, which could dramatically reduce homelessness and, per Columbia researchers, reduce poverty in America by a fifth.

Even on health care, an issue Biden has deemphasized, he is promising big changes, like lowering the Medicare age to 60. His staff tells me that the public option he’s proposing will be available not just to people on the Obamacare exchanges, but people with employer-based coverage they dislike and to large employers that want another option (similar to the Center for American Progress’s Medicare Extra for All Plan).

His climate plan features $2 trillion in investments in clean energy and a clean electricity standard mandating that electricity production in the US not produce any carbon by the year 2035. The Sunrise Movement, which gave Biden an “F-” grade for his climate policies during the primaries, put out a statement praising the plan. Julian Brave NoiseCat, director of Green New Deal strategy for Data for Progress, called the plan “a Green New Deal in all but name.”

With the possible exception of the public option proposal, where things get a little messy, all the above legislation is passable through the “budget reconciliation” process, which allows senators to evade the filibuster. Normally, the filibuster means that legislation needs 60 Senators to pass. In budget reconciliation, legislation only needs 50 senators — which Democrats have.

Also requiring only 50 senators? Judicial appointments. Biden’s first focus will likely be on lower courts, where Trump did a tremendous amount to put in young conservatives set to serve for decades. He might also get an early Supreme Court appointment if Stephen Breyer, 82, retires this spring, as many expect. Biden will not likely be able to shift the court’s politics, absent an aggressive court-packing effort; the oldest conservative, Clarence Thomas, is only 72 and unlikely to retire under a Democrat. But he will be able to protect what liberal seats exist currently.

If Senate Democrats are willing to end or weaken the filibuster rule, they and Biden could get more ambitious still. This seems unlikely, given moderate Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) opposition to changing the filibuster. But it’s possible. Former President Obama and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have strongly urged Senate Democrats to abandon the rule. Even relatively moderate Democratic senators like Biden’s Delaware successor Chris Coons have expressed openness to altering the filibuster rule so McConnell is not able to block the entire Biden-Harris agenda. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said that abolishing the filibuster is not “off the table” in the new Congress.

An obvious place to start in a post-filibuster world is passing HR 1, the reform bill passed first by the new Democratic House in 2019, which establishes public financing of elections, re-empowers the Federal Election Commission, requires presidential candidates to release tax returns, enacts automatic voter registration nationwide and makes Election Day a national holiday, and requires all states to use independent commissions to draw congressional districts.

Congress could also admit DC as a state and set a binding referendum for Puerto Rican statehood, which would expand the Senate and likely bolster Democrats’ majority in the body. If Sanders’s effort to use budget reconciliation to raise the minimum wage fails, altering the filibuster to boost the wage could be a natural move, too.

A filibuster-less Congress would also be better prepared to tackle immigration reform, which Biden has told activists will be one of his top priorities. He has promised to immediately send Congress a bill offering a pathway to citizenship for the 11-12 million immigrants without legal status, with an expedited pathway for child arrivals and essential Covid-19 pandemic workers. That will likely require either abolishing the filibuster, attracting significant Senate Republican support, or using budget reconciliation rules more aggressively than they’ve been used before. It’s a tough road, but not an impassable one.

There’s more to life than Congress, though, and Biden’s executive powers are significant. Biden can use his executive authority to set aggressive new climate rules, expand immigration by hundreds of thousands of people per year and protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, ease the federal ban on marijuana possession, fight air pollution and factory farming, experiment with postal banking, and toughen up regulations targeting monopolies and financial companies.

On foreign policy, his executive powers are even more extensive. Biden and his team — consisting largely of longtime Obama/Biden loyalists like national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State-designate Antony Blinken, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, along with some new faces like Defense Secretary-designate Gen. Lloyd Austin — are set to quickly rejoin the Paris climate accords and Iran nuclear deal, reengage with Cuba, and reorient Middle East policy away from strict allegiance to Saudi Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Biden promised to end support for the Saudis in Yemen’s bloody civil war, and incoming senior administration officials — including Blinken, Haines, Sullivan, and UN Ambassador-designate Linda Thomas-Greenfield — signed an open letter urging the same, suggesting that will be an early priority for the administration.

But even on executive action, Biden’s hands will not be entirely free. Some Trump measures, like labeling Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism, will take months or years of interagency process to undue. Reengaging on topics like the Iran nuclear deal will take years of delicate work as well. And aggressive domestic executive actions, like new climate regulations, will surely be challenged in the courts, where they will face many Trump appointees and a new 6-3 Republican appointee majority on the Supreme Court.

A new beginning

The Biden-Harris administration is going to almost immediately be faced with massive institutional impediments to the agenda it wants to implement. The key question it will face is whether to eliminate those institutional impediments or try to accommodate itself to them. If it chooses the former, it could go down in history as one of the most consequential presidencies in histories, one that cuts poverty in half, establishes housing as a human right, and begins tackling climate change in earnest. If it chooses the latter, the prospects are much grimmer.

The last four years have been consequential for the lives of Americans, from policy changes in the normal range of Republican presidencies (like Trump moving the Supreme Court markedly rightward and curtailing environmental and public safety regulations) to ones well outside it (like Trump’s enormous crackdown on legal immigration and his failed pandemic response). The public has also endured unprecedented levels of executive branch corruption and arguably criminality, not to mention two presidential impeachments.

Biden’s inauguration is America’s first step away from those changes and the people who made them. But it won’t instantly clean up the wreckage of the Trump administration, let alone the problems that enabled Trump to win and thrive in the first place.

Instead, it marks the beginning of Biden’s confrontation with a broken system and a bitterly divided citizenry. Judging by Biden’s plans for his first days in office, though, he has no intention of backing away from a fight. The new administration appears set to use the tools at its disposal to achieve as much of its agenda as possible, as fast as possible. The big question for the next two years is just how far it will go.",voxdotcom,"['100', 'trump', 'plan', 'public', 'biden', 'set', 'days', 'senate', 'pass', 'economy', 'covid19', 'plans', 'change', 'filibuster', 'bidens', 'congress', 'climate']",0
2021-01-20 22:55:29+00:00,76,"President Joe Biden isn’t waiting for Congress to start enacting his policy agenda. His presidency is beginning with an aggressive first 10 days in the Oval Office with a suite of executive orders and actions.

The promised actions span from the substantive to more symbolic. Some repeal key parts of former President Donald Trump’s agenda; others lay the groundwork for some of Biden’s own progressive promises.

On his first day, Biden will sign 17 executive initiatives. He’ll mandate masks on federal property. He’ll rescind Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. He’ll extend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums as well as a student loan pause. He’ll take multiple actions on global warming, including rejoining the Paris agreement. He’ll move on immigration, reversing Trump’s travel ban and stopping construction of a wall at the US-Mexico border. He’ll reinforce commitments to racial equity and nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people. And more.

Biden’s team emphasized in a call with reporters that these day-one actions were only the start. A memo from White House chief of staff Ron Klain outlined Biden’s plans to tackle “four overlapping and compounding crises”: Covid-19, the economy, global warming, and racial justice. Short of congressional action, Biden will sign “dozens of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies” to address those areas and more.

“In the coming days and weeks we will be announcing additional executive actions that confront these challenges and deliver on the President-elect’s promises to the American people, including revoking the ban on military service by transgender Americans, and reversing the Mexico City policy,” spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement on Tuesday.

There are limits to what Biden can do through executive actions. Addressing some issues — including the most immediate crises of Covid-19 and the economy — will require more money. Biden will need Congress to approve that. While Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package (which includes a $400 billion Covid-19 plan), Democrats hold only the slimmest majorities in Congress, and it’s unclear yet if policymakers will approve a proposal with such a high price tag.

Biden’s executive actions, in part, acknowledge that reality, and ensure that he’ll be able to claim some movement in his first few days as the hard work of getting legislation through Congress gets started.

Some of the moves will also have an immediate impact — helping millions of Americans who would struggle to pay rent and student loans, providing some relief to undocumented immigrants, and shifting the country toward combating climate change.

The scope of the actions is a reflection of Biden running on one of the most progressive agendas in history. But it’s also an acknowledgment that Democrats didn’t perform well enough in congressional races to fully implement that agenda. Now Biden will need to use his more limited executive powers to fill some of the gaps between his campaign promises and hard political realities.

What Biden’s executive actions do

Biden will take a range of executive actions quickly, simultaneously aiming to move the nation past the Trump era, address pressing crises, and fulfill campaign promises. The full details can be read in a fact sheet and memo, but here are some of the bigger components:

Action on Covid-19 : Biden will impose masking and physical distancing requirements on federal property — part of his “100-Days Masking Challenge” to get Americans to wear masks. He’ll move to rejoin the World Health Organization, following Trump’s decision to withdraw from the group. He’ll create a position of Covid-19 response coordinator and reestablish the National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, an executive team that Trump disbanded that handled pandemic response. More action is reportedly coming, including efforts to expand testing and set up “clear public health standards” regarding Covid-19.

Economic relief : Biden will ask federal agencies to extend federal moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures through at least March 31, which will likely help millions of Americans. He’ll also extend a pause on interest and principal payments for direct federal student loans through at least September 30. And Biden vowed to direct his Cabinet “to take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families bearing the brunt of this crisis.”

And Biden vowed to direct his Cabinet “to take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families bearing the brunt of this crisis.” Efforts to fight global warming : Biden will rejoin the Paris agreement, an international treaty binding countries to combat global warming. Biden will also sign an order reversing a wide range of Trump’s actions on climate change and taking new actions of his own. Included in that list: directing federal agencies to revise vehicle fuel economy and emission standards, imposing a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and revoking the Keystone XL pipeline permit. Biden’s team also promised further action in the coming weeks “with the urgency the science demands.”

Biden will reinforce Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which has provided legal protections to the children of undocumented immigrants. He’ll also reverse Trump’s travel ban, rescind Trump’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, and move to stop construction of the border wall, among other steps. With Biden already proposing legislation to reform the immigration system, this is an area he’ll certainly come back to in the future.

Rejecting bigotry: Biden will sign an executive order establishing that “advancing equity for all … is the responsibility of the whole of our government,” directing federal agencies to act on that principle. The order will also rescind Trump’s 1776 Commission and limits on diversity and inclusion training within federal agencies. Separately, Biden will sign an order that acknowledges the ban on sex-based discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, including in federal agencies.

Separately, Biden will sign an order that acknowledges the ban on sex-based discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, including in federal agencies. Improving government’s function: Biden will sign an order requiring “every appointee in the executive branch to sign an ethics pledge” and aiming to “ensure that executive branch employees act in the interest of the American people and not for personal gain,” building on similar action by former President Barack Obama. He’ll also pull back Trump-era rules on establishing new regulations while directing the director of the Office of Management and Budget to improve the regulatory review process. And he’ll issue a regulatory freeze to give his administration time to review new regulations imposed during Trump’s final days.

Much of the executive actions are focused on reversing Trump’s legacy, especially on his iconic issue of immigration. From the travel ban to the border wall, Trump did a lot on this topic that Biden and Democrats opposed. But because much of it was tied to executive instead of congressional actions, a new president has the chance to undo the bulk of that work.

Biden’s team emphasized more is to come — particularly to make it easier in the coming months and years to claim asylum in the US, which Trump made much more difficult in his years in office.

But Biden will also take a slew of actions that essentially build on Obama’s presidency. On climate change, for example, Biden’s moves to rejoin the Paris agreement and bring back rules first imposed by Obama start where the last Democratic administration finished. Climate change remains a top issue among Democrats, so this is a logical area, politically, for Biden to focus some proactive energy on.

And some of the actions simply address the most pressing issues of the day, particularly Covid-19 and the economic crisis.

Still, these actions are limited. They stand to provide some relief to millions of Americans and make other improvements here and there, but they won’t come close to solving any of the continuing and compounding crises that Biden’s team has acknowledged. That will take an act of Congress — and likely weeks, months, or years of work.

Biden is doing what he can for now

Although he was widely considered the moderate option in the Democratic presidential primary, Biden ultimately ran a very progressive campaign once he won the nomination. From economic inequality to health care to global warming, Biden promised a big shift to the left on a host of issues. As Matt Yglesias wrote for Vox, “His platform is in many ways a surprisingly progressive approach to policy that the left sees as a triumph of their own work in trying to change the terms of debate in American politics.”

Progressive hopes were largely dashed on Election Day 2020 when Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives and didn’t take control of the Senate. Some of those hopes were rekindled by the Georgia runoffs, which handed Democrats a razor-thin majority in the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. But with such a slim majority, and moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ) effectively setting the limits of the Democratic agenda, there’s a ceiling to how far Biden will be able to go.

That doesn’t mean Biden has given up. He’s already proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, including a $400 billion Covid-19 plan, and a comprehensive immigration reform bill. He’s spoken about finding common ground with Republicans — which would defy the polarized trends of the last few presidential administrations but would give Biden some wiggle room to get more done.

The reality, though, is this is going to be a tough political environment for the sweeping agenda that Biden ran on. There’s likely to be action on some of the more pressing issues, particularly Covid-19 and that stimulus plan. But more controversial actions, particularly those that can’t pass the Senate with a simple majority as tax-and-spend measures, seem less likely, such as building on the Affordable Care Act, a minimum wage hike, democratic reform, sweeping action on climate change, or significant criminal justice legislation.

Turning to executive actions is a way for the Biden White House to hit the ground running. But it’s also a reflection of that broader political reality.",voxdotcom,"['actions', 'explained', 'federal', 'hell', 'biden', 'firstday', 'covid19', 'flurry', 'executive', 'agencies', 'bidens', 'action', 'sign', 'trumps']",0
2021-01-20 22:20:04+00:00,11,"How do you host an inaugural parade under the potential threat of violence and a skyrocketing death toll from a highly contagious virus? Virtually.

Even ahead of the January 6 storming of the Capitol, now-President Joe Biden’s inaugural committee planned to modify the day’s celebrations due to the danger posed by Covid-19, which has now killed more than 400,000 Americans. Together, the insurrection and the pandemic have made for a different inauguration, with the usual crowds absent.

Abandoning the traditional pomp of an in-person parade, Biden elected instead to host a virtual “Parade Across America.” Following in the tradition of the Democratic National Committee’s successful virtual convention last summer, the inaugural committee hosted an event featuring regular “heroes” — everyday Americans who have engaged in noteworthy behavior — and celebrities.

The event was kicked off by the University of Delaware and Howard University drumlines, the president’s and vice president’s alma maters, respectively. They escorted Biden and Harris from 15th Street to the White House and began a series of live performances announced by Charlie Brotman, who has announced almost every inauguration parade since President Dwight D. Eisenhower (former President Donald Trump was the only president not to invite him).

The rest of the event was hosted by Tony Goldwyn, who played a fictional president on Shonda Rhimes’s show Scandal, and featured appearances by Jon Stewart, New Radicals, and Earth, Wind, and Fire, among other famous entertainers.

This new format made for a unique parade, one that showcased everyday Americans, whom the Biden team refers to as American “heroes.” They ranged from a teacher in Texas who went on a road trip to teach her virtual classroom history from important locations to a 12-year-old who played the trumpet for hospital workers during their breaks.

Biden’s team has hoped to emphasize unity as the theme of the inaugural events and ultimately was able to do so symbolically in his inaugural parade — highlighting Americans from all 56 US states and territories, a first for inaugural parades, according to the inaugural committee. The “Celebrating America” primetime special, which will air at 8:30 pm ET, is expected to follow this pattern, bringing together celebrities and noncelebrities to emphasize the theme of unity.

The day before his inauguration as the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden sought to begin a collective and public grieving of the more than 400,000 American lives lost in the Covid-19 pandemic.

“To heal, we must remember. It’s hard. But that’s how we heal,” Biden said, speaking from the base of the Lincoln Memorial during the Covid-19 memorial being held as part of his inauguration activities. “It is important we do that as a nation. That’s why we are here today.”

Pillars of light lined the Reflecting Pool. Lori Marie Key, a Michigan nurse who works in a Covid-19 unit, sang “Amazing Grace” to open the proceedings. Gospel singer Yolanda Adams followed Biden with her rendition of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” and the entire ceremony was over in less than 10 minutes.

But the symbolism was still powerful. The memorial occurred on the same day that the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the US surpassed 400,000. And it came the day before Biden becomes president, replacing Donald Trump, who has until now led the nation through the coronavirus pandemic and, in the estimation of most public health experts, fallen woefully short in his response.

Trump downplayed the coronavirus threat throughout the past year. He promised the American people a year ago that it would be quickly under control. He said that businesses could reopen by Easter. He defied public health guidance to hold indoor, mostly maskless campaign rallies starting in July. The political polarization of Covid-19, driven primarily by the misinformation propagated by the president, has hampered the ability of public health authorities to convince the public to wear masks, socially distance, and make other sacrifices as the best means of beating back the virus.

Biden, from the start of his presidential campaign, sought to in his words reclaim the soul of America from its contamination by Trump. He initially pegged that corruption to the white nationalist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, where Trump appeared unable to condemn the racist displays seen there.

But the pandemic made the stakes of that battle much more visceral.

Trump’s response to the coronavirus was defined by xenophobia, baseless hype, and a decided lack of empathy. Biden has promised to change the government policies that he believes have let down the American people during this crisis. But with the country seeing more than 200,000 new cases and 3,000 new deaths every day on average, it will take time to turn the tide of the pandemic.

More than anything, Biden’s advisers told me before the election, he needed to restore a sense of leadership and fill the void Biden thought Trump had left.

Those pillars of light surrounding Biden were a reminder: The cost of the last year’s failure has been hundreds of thousands of lives cut short. Thousands more people will die in the coming days.

Perhaps, with new leadership, there can be some hope that the worst is finally behind us. But that doesn’t change what has already happened.

2021-01-19 22:15:02+00:00,30,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

In just the 11 months since the country’s first confirmed death from Covid-19, the disease has killed as many Americans as US soldiers who died during four years of World War II.

That figure is also almost surely an undercount. The number of excess deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic (the number of deaths that have occurred in excess of what would ordinarily be expected based on long-running trends) is closer to 500,000, according to some recent estimates. Some of the additional 100,000 deaths may not be from the coronavirus — they could, instead, be people who couldn’t get adequate medical care because health systems have been strained by the pandemic — but experts think a substantial portion probably are uncounted Covid-19 deaths.

Regardless, the loss of human life over the past year has been extraordinary. The US has by far the most confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the world and nearly doubles the toll in Brazil, the second-hardest-hit country. Even when adjusting for population, America ranks 11th in the world in Covid-19 deaths per million people.

And even now, nearly a year into the pandemic, deaths are piling up faster and faster, rather than slowing down. It took about three months from the first confirmed Covid-19 death in the US in late February for the country to hit 100,000 deaths. Another four months elapsed before the country reached 200,000 deaths in late September. But then things picked up speed during the winter surge: The US added 100,000 more deaths in less than two months, and from there, it took a little more than a month to go from 300,000 to 400,000 deaths.

What went so wrong? Vox’s German Lopez explained at the beginning of this month:

The primary answer lies in President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, who have collectively abdicated the federal government’s role in addressing the outbreak or even acknowledging its severity. From Trump’s borderline denialist messaging on Covid-19 to Congress’s inability to pass broader economic relief, the country has been left in a place where states, local governments, and the public have to fend for themselves — and none of them have the resources to deal with the coronavirus on their own. Trump and his allies have also actively worked to sideline the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, crippling the agency’s ability to provide guidance to states and others that have now been left out on their own. At the same time, there are serious structural issues that hindered states’ and the public’s ability to act. Experts have long argued that the US’s public health infrastructure is underresourced and ill prepared for a serious crisis, and the pandemic has exposed this many times over: Nearly a year into the pandemic, no state has capacities for testing and contact tracing that most experts would consider adequate.

President-elect Joe Biden is coming into the White House promising to pass a big bill allocating more funding for the Covid-19 response and to fix the nation’s troubled vaccine rollout. More precautions and more vaccinations could help reduce the loss of life going forward.

As record daily Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths this month in the US have pushed the pandemic to new crisis levels, senior government health officials have lamented that many patients are not getting the drugs — including monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and corticosteroids — available to treat the disease, leaving many doses unused.

There are still questions about how well many of these drugs work. One recent report found that a mix of monoclonal antibodies developed by Eli Lilly could reduce Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths by 70 percent, though some researchers cautioned that the findings were drawn from a small number of events.

And with the new, potentially more contagious variants of the virus that causes Covid-19 now spreading, a few of these therapies could prove even less effective.

After some stumbles earlier with drugs like hydroxychloroquine, regulators have authorized monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and corticosteroids. Doctors say these drugs have helped them save lives, putting them in a far better position than they were last year and cushioning the blow of this pandemic.

Yet US health officials say hospitals are still struggling to get them administered, and to get patients to the hospital in time to take advantage of them. In particular, they noted earlier this month that less than 25 percent of available doses of monoclonal antibodies have been administered.

“Even with a vaccine, we know we will not prevent every infection,” said US Surgeon General Jerome Adams on January 14 during a press conference. “So today we want to remind everyone that for those of you who do contract Covid, we have excellent treatments to keep you out of the hospital, to keep you out of the ICU, to help you recover quickly.”

Administering these treatments most effectively also requires good timing. Some, like corticosteroids, work best in later stages of the disease; others, like monoclonal antibodies, need to be administered to patients early in the course of their illness, often before someone is even sick enough to go to the hospital.

That means testing to confirm that someone is carrying the virus and getting the results quickly is crucial, particularly for people at the highest risk of severe disease, like those over the age of 65. Then those patients need to get to a hospital that has the capacity to treat them in time. Many of these treatments also need medical supervision, adding further stress to hospitals reaching capacity. And as health facilities get overwhelmed, fatality rates are rising.

The Department of Health and Human Services has put together a website highlighting the tools available to control the pandemic and where people can receive treatments near them.

Here is how doctors think about treating Covid-19 patients, some of the most common treatments they have at their disposal, and their drawbacks.

Several tools and strategies for treating Covid-19 have emerged, with varying effectiveness

There are two main approaches for dealing with Covid-19. One is to constrain the virus, and the other is to temper the immune system’s response to it.

In the early stages of the disease, the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is the main culprit behind the damage, leading to symptoms like coughing and a loss of smell. But as the disease progresses, the body’s immune system starts to overreact, causing problems like inflammation and, later, organ damage.

Figuring out what works to tamp down this often deadly disease has been tricky. Ideally, scientists would conduct randomized controlled trials, but in the face of an overwhelming pandemic, it’s been hard to recruit people into these studies and get adequate results in time. Much of the evidence for drugs to treat Covid-19 comes from weaker observational studies, leaving some therapies under a frustrating cloud of uncertainty. And doctors have been inclined to prescribe drugs that have already been approved for other uses and have an established safety record.

“We don’t have time to find a new drug in a test tube and do years of studying to make sure it’s safe,” said Matthew McCarthy, an associate professor at Weill Cornell Medicine who has been treating Covid-19 patients since the start of the pandemic. “We want to take drugs that we know are safe and see if they can help with Covid.”

But research is still underway to find better treatment options, and more therapies, from repurposed existing drugs to novel drugs, could become available soon.

Treatments include the following:

Convalescent plasma: The idea here is to use plasma, the liquid part of blood plus the proteins used for clotting, harvested from patients who survived Covid-19. During an infection, the immune system generates proteins called antibodies. They stick to a part of the virus or to an infected cell. That attachment can then block the virus from invading hosts, or it can flag the virus or infected cell for destruction by other immune cells.

After a patient successfully defeats the virus, their blood contains a variety of antibodies that stick to all different parts of the virus. Doctors then transfer those remaining antibodies via plasma to a patient with an active infection. Without outside help, the immune system can take several days to produce antibodies, so getting some from outside can bolster defenses, particularly for people at high risk.

This technique has been used in the past to treat other infections, but the evidence of how well it works against SARS-CoV-2 is mixed. The Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization to convalescent plasma last year, but the National Institutes of Health reported at the time that the evidence for its effectiveness was weak. Subsequent studies seemed to show that it helps slow the disease when administered early, particularly in older adults. More recent results have also been conflicting, with one study in the UK reporting no benefit and another finding that convalescent plasma rich in antibodies lowered the risk of death. Revised FDA guidelines allow convalescent plasma to be used to treat hospitalized patients.

The supply of convalescent plasma is limited by the number of patients who donate. And it’s infused intravenously, so it has to be administered by a professional. The main concerning side effects are allergic reactions and circulation problems associated with transfusion.

Monoclonal antibodies: This approach takes the idea behind convalescent plasma one step further. Some antibodies are more effective than others at corralling a given pathogen, so if one clones the best antibodies, they could be used as the basis for a targeted drug.

There are now two monoclonal antibody therapies for Covid-19 that have received emergency use authorizations from the FDA. One is called bamlanivimab, developed by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. The other is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, created by Regeneron (the -mab suffix stands for “monoclonal antibody”). President Trump famously received a course of the Regeneron therapy when he was ill with Covid-19 last year.

Under Operation Warp Speed, more than 500,000 doses of these therapies have been distributed across the US. Only about 25 percent of these doses have been used, despite high levels of Covid-19 transmission.

Like convalescent plasma, these drugs require transfusion. But monoclonal antibodies are most effective in the early stages of the illness, rather than in patients who are already hospitalized.

“By the time you’re hospitalized, your immune system is kicked into high gear and it may simply be too late,” McCarthy said. Some hospitals around the country have reported good results using monoclonal antibodies, with the treatment reducing the likelihood of a high-risk patient needing hospitalization.

However, NIH has been more skeptical of the evidence provided to date. For both the Eli Lilly therapy and the Regeneron therapy, the agency said “there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use” of these drugs and that they “should not be considered the standard of care.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that these drugs don’t work — just that the research to date hasn’t yielded a definitive answer.

Side effects are similar to those of convalescent plasma, with allergic reactions being the main concern.

Antivirals: These are drugs that directly interfere with the reproductive cycle of a virus. Since viruses like SARS-CoV-2 use human cells to make copies of themselves, it’s tricky to come up with a drug that hampers the virus without causing any collateral damage.

Remdesivir has emerged as a leading antiviral drug against Covid-19. Sold under the brand name Veklury by Gilead Sciences, it was the first drug to receive full FDA approval to treat Covid-19, becoming the new standard of care. It works by imitating one of the molecules the virus uses to encode the instructions for making copies of itself. The impostor molecule causes the viral replication process to stall, but it doesn’t fool human cells, giving it a targeted effect.

It was initially developed to treat the Ebola virus. There are concerns about how well it works with Covid-19. The World Health Organization conducted one of the largest studies to date on antiviral drugs for Covid-19 and found that remdesivir had little to no effect on mortality. However, several smaller studies found that it could reduce the length of hospital stays in patients.

McCarthy said that means the drug can still be useful. Shorter hospital stays mean fewer beds occupied, which in turn allows health workers to treat more patients. The drug is mainly administered to Covid-19 patients who are hospitalized.

Side effects of remdesivir include elevated liver enzymes, which could indicate liver damage, as well as allergic reactions leading to fever, shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling, low blood oxygen, and changes in blood pressure. This is also a transfused drug, so the same concerns about circulation problems apply here, as well as the challenge of administering it under medical supervision.

Corticosteroids: As Covid-19 progresses, it can throw the immune system way off balance. Immune cells can start attacking healthy cells, and the strain of being on high alert can trigger dangerous immunological conditions like cytokine storms, even after the virus has been cleared from the body.

So drugs that tamp down on the immune system can help patients in more advanced stages of the disease. This seems to be the case with dexamethasone, a generic corticosteroid. It’s one of the few drugs that has been shown to actually reduce the mortality rate of Covid-19, and it costs as little as $1 per dose, administered orally.

That’s why it’s quickly become one of the most common drugs used to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients who are ill enough to need oxygen support.

However, because it can slow the immune system, it could actually backfire in early stages of Covid-19 when the virus itself is the main concern. Dexamethasone can also leave patients vulnerable to other infections and may cause dizziness, an irregular heartbeat, and psychiatric problems like anxiety and suicidal ideation.

Other emerging treatments: So far, there is still no surefire way to knock out Covid-19 the way an antibiotic can wipe away a bacterial infection. That’s why many doctors often use several of these therapies in conjunction to treat Covid-19 patients, like remdesivir and dexamethasone for hospitalized patients. “Those two things are given so frequently together that some people as a shorthand call it ‘remdexavir,’” said McCarthy.

But researchers are also investigating other drugs, both off-the-shelf varieties and new designs, to see if they can make more gains against the virus. Clinical trials are underway for drugs that act as immune system modulators like abatacept and infliximab, for instance, which are already used for rheumatoid arthritis, to deal with immunological imbalances wrought by Covid-19. A small randomized trial found that fluvoxamine, an antidepressant, prevented symptoms from getting worse in Covid-19 patients within seven days of symptoms appearing. Large scale trials are also beginning for generic drugs like the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine and the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin.

Doctors are also developing protocols to deal with patients experiencing lasting problems from Covid-19, the so-called long-haulers. “I think what you’re going to see six months or a year from now, long Covid is not going to be one diagnosis but a series or collection of different conditions,” McCarthy said. Persistent fatigue, neurological problems, and breathing trouble can linger, and each set of symptoms may require its own course of treatment. Some Covid-19 patients have had strokes, while others are reeling from blood clotting disorders.

“It’s become clear to me that I’m going to be dealing with coronavirus and the sequelae of it for years and years,” McCarthy said. And more research is still needed to determine what will work best for these many survivors who are still suffering.

Why it’s still so hard to deploy treatments for Covid-19

Despite the growing variety of options, health officials are concerned that not enough people are getting them. “These medications, these therapeutics, are not being used as much as I, or the doctors on the task force, or the career experts here at HHS feel that they should be,” Adams said. “Tools that never leave the toolbox don’t get the work done.”

Officials say part of the problem is public awareness — people don’t know that these options are available to them. Many public health agencies are also not conveying that there are treatments that can help people before they are hospitalized.

Another issue is that many of these drugs have to be administered early in the course of the disease. That means people need to get tested for the virus and get results quickly. People in high-risk groups in particular should then seek treatment right away, especially if they begin to notice breathing issues.

Hospitals are also filling up with patients, and many can’t spare the personnel to treat people with less severe symptoms, particularly with drugs that require transfusions. “The antibodies are not in shortage,” said Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA, during a press call this month. “We have a shortage of ability to administer these to patients.”

There are other options, however. Patients can receive these therapies at dedicated transfusion centers, or can have nurses administer the therapy at home, but both of these alternatives pose their own logistical challenges.

Cost is another barrier. While off-the-shelf therapies like dexamethasone are cheap, and the government is fronting the cost of the drugs for monoclonal antibodies, health providers can still charge for using their facilities. Transfusions in particular can cost hundreds to more than $1,000 out of pocket, depending on insurance coverage.

The Covid-19 pandemic is also throwing some curveballs. New variants of the virus are now spreading in the United States. These variants contain mutations that could weaken prior immunity to the virus and may elude targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies.

“We are actively looking at that question,” Woodcock said. “We can’t predict what variants will arise and will become prevalent, so we have to rely on sampling and testing that’s done across the United States” to continue studying the efficacy of these drugs.

A spokesperson for Regeneron told Vox that the company’s combination of two monoclonal antibodies still seems to be effective against the apparently more contagious B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom. The 501.V2 variant first detected in South Africa seems to elude one of the antibodies in the treatment regimen, but not the other.

“We’ll continue to test/replicate our data to confirm that is the case,” the spokesperson wrote in an email.

Drugs that aren’t specific to a given version of the virus like corticosteroids or antivirals are likely to remain as effective against the new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

To keep treatments viable, the full suite of public health tools to control the pandemic must be used. Relieving the stress on hospitals requires reducing transmission of the virus, which in turn demands social distancing, masking, and rigorous hand-washing. Reducing transmission also lowers the chances of mutations that could render treatments less effective.

Administering care away from hospitals whenever possible could also lift the burden on hospitals and allow them to focus on the most critically ill patients.

Though the coming weeks are likely to remain grim, with high levels of hospitalizations and deaths, the combination of treatments and vaccines does offer hope. Progress against the pandemic will continue to be slow, hard-fought, and fragile, but we now have tools that we didn’t before. It’s a matter of whether and how we wield them.",voxdotcom,"['immune', 'arent', 'virus', 'covid19', 'patients', 'antibodies', 'health', 'using', 'monoclonal', 'treat', 'treatments', 'drugs', 'tools']",0
2021-01-19 16:59:05+00:00,8,"Since December, a handful of fortunate end-of-day shoppers have received coveted doses of the coronavirus vaccine by simply being in the right place at the right time. That place, during a pandemic, could be a Safeway or a Walgreens. Some of these recipients are young and healthy adults, and have likened their surprise immunization to winning the lottery.

As the country embarks on a decentralized Covid-19 vaccine rollout program, grocery stores and pharmacies are at the forefront of inoculating local residents and, in some cases, issuing leftover doses to whoever might be available. Some social media users have joked about hanging around pharmacies near closing time in the hope of receiving a leftover vaccine dose, instead of allowing it to go to waste.

Los Angeles County, for example, has no official standby line for the coronavirus vaccine, but hundreds of “vaccine chasers” — young people, entire families, and even seniors unable to secure an appointment — have flocked to sites countywide in the hopes of receiving an expiring shot. Getting a vaccine depends on who you know and access to local news: The Los Angeles Times reported that those waiting outside clinics “heard about the opportunity through word of mouth in their social and professional networks,” and some hailed from wealthier neighborhoods.

State and local jurisdictions are being recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue their first vaccine doses to health care personnel, residents of long-term care facilities, and, more recently, adults over 65 and anyone with underlying medical conditions. These are only recommendations, though. Governors and individual vaccination sites are in charge of implementing their own vaccine prioritization plans. As coronavirus cases rise, state officials are amending their vaccine guidelines to include a larger population of people.

The US is lagging behind its projected vaccination goal of 20 million people by the end of 2020; only about 9 million people have received the vaccine’s first dose as of January 11. The two available vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, have to be injected within hours after the doses are thawed from subzero storage temperatures, which complicates their distribution. Health and state officials have begun urging medical providers to consider vaccinating lower-priority groups to minimize vaccine wastage. As a result of these logistical hiccups, a small group of healthy, low-priority people has been administered the vaccine as a measure of last resort.

Group of people I know got vaccinated because they were at the right place at the right time with many doses set to expire & be tossed. — The Natidude (@TheNatidude) January 11, 2021

A number of these random immunizations (that have been publicly documented, at least) have occurred in Washington, DC, where local health officials have encouraged pharmacists to adopt a zero-waste policy. A DC-based law student posted a viral TikTok of his Moderna shot, which he was offered while grocery shopping at a Giant Food. A DC-based reporter was inoculated at Safeway after hearing an in-store announcement that its pharmacy had extra doses left. A DC couple was able to get on a Safeway pharmacy waitlist to receive end-of-day vaccines for when priority patients fail to show up for one.

There have been a few instances reported elsewhere as well: A Louisville couple made news for receiving a Christmas Eve vaccine at a local Walgreens. “[A friend] called us, and we ran right up. It was pure luck,” the recipient told the Courier Journal. The pharmacy later said it sought to prioritize its excess doses to first responders, Walgreens staff, and senior residents as the news garnered attention.

Sudden time-sensitive incidents such as a malfunctioning hospital freezer in Ukiah, California, have forced providers to make rapid distribution decisions with little forethought. But there are also instances of those looking to jump the line if providers are disorganized. The Los Angeles Times reported that at one South LA vaccination site in early January, about 100 people received vaccines without being asked to show proof that they worked in the health care industry.

These stories of circumstantial — even chaotic — vaccinations might provide a semblance of hope for those who fall further down the priority list. According to Business Insider, pharmacies and grocery stores in the DC metro area are already fielding “tons of calls” from interested recipients eager to get on a vaccine waitlist. These last-minute lists in DC, however, have quickly filled up via word of mouth. A pharmacy manager in Pennsylvania told the local Fox News station that it only takes names of those eligible under the state’s 1A categorization, which includes health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, for its “do not waste” list. (The Food and Drug Administration and the federal government have yet to issue guidelines on who these extra doses should go to.)

These waitlists and random occurrences aren’t necessarily cause for optimism, though, especially as the vaccination timeline for most Americans remains unclear and varies from state to state.

“There has been outsized media and social media attention to the number of people this has happened to,” Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy of the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Vox. “It’s a good approach to not waste vaccine doses at the end of the day ... but in the grand scheme of things, it’s going to be a marginal contribution to vaccinations. The bulk of vaccinations being done at pharmacies are for those who fit into the prioritization groups and made appointments.”

It’s possible that vaccine providers might no longer need to resort to waitlists or last-minute immunizations, Michaud said, since the federal government has revised their vaccine recommendations: “We’re seeing more states moving in that direction, so the phenomenon of finding a random person might become less common, simply because there will be more people who fit into those higher-priority categories.”

The public desperation for a last-minute shot signifies a top-down failure of the federal government: Officials have largely ignored expert warnings of the potential for logistical hindrances, and there is no cohesive communication campaign to inform Americans when they’re available for a shot. Even as providers do their best to minimize vaccine waste, the disorganized rollout makes it harder for higher-risk Americans to receive the first vaccine dose. This approach “undercut[s] the needs-based approach to those who are savvy and to those who realize what’s going on,” Arthur Caplan of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University told Business Insider.

The US population has a long way to go to reach herd immunity — which may require 70-85 percent of the population vaccinated — in order for normal life to resume. Officials have maintained that the more people who get vaccinated, the better, and so the general interest toward these random store vaccinations is a good thing. But most members of the public won’t be able to skip the wait, unlike the lucky few on social media, no matter how often they stop by their local pharmacy.",voxdotcom,"['local', 'officials', 'health', 'right', 'vaccine', 'coronavirus', 'doses', 'pharmacy', 'managed', 'random', 'care', 'leftover', 'providers', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-19 15:07:05+00:00,28,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0
2021-01-17 04:47:04+00:00,146,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

Share All sharing options for: Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new Covid-19 variants, in 2 charts

A more contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is a deadlier one. Not because it gets any individual sicker but because it reaches more people. More illness means more cases: more mild cases, more severe cases, more long-term complications, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.

There’s no one perfect estimate for how much more contagious the SARS-CoV-2 variant called B.1.1.7, which was first discovered in the UK, might be. There needs to be more careful lab work done in animals to nail it down, which could take a few more weeks. But preliminary estimates find it to be between 30 percent and 70 percent more contagious. This variant is now popping up all over the world: in the US, throughout Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere. It’s especially concerning, considering that, in the US and elsewhere, the pandemic’s spread is still reaching new heights.

There’s also a variant called 501Y.V2 that was first found in South Africa; it appears less widespread than B.1.1.7, but also to be more contagious than older variants. It’s still possible that other more transmissible variants will emerge in the future. Scientists just don’t know.

Regardless of exactly how transmissible any new variant is, any possible increase in transmissibility is extremely concerning to epidemiologists and others in public health. It means now, more than ever, our collective and individual actions to stop the spread are critically important.

Here are a few key reasons why.

A more transmissible virus simply means more cases

The reason for concern over a more contagious variant of the virus is simple. “Once it [the variant] becomes common, it will accelerate transmission considerably,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a press call. Accelerated transmission means more cases.

That’s because the virus grows exponentially. Any increase in its inherent transmissibility causes an increasingly high number of cases down the line, if control measures don’t also accelerate to keep up.

With a 50 percent increase in infectiousness, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch says. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” It could be higher, he says.

A more transmissible virus means we need to work harder to stop the spread

Epidemiologists think about the transmissibility of a virus with a figure called R, or the basic reproduction number. This describes how many new cases, on average, will follow one case of the virus.

In the beginning of the outbreak, before the world sprang into action, epidemiologists estimated the R to be around 2 or 3. Since then, thanks to our (inconsistently implemented) efforts — mask-wearing, social distancing, business closures, etc — the R has been reduced in many states to around 1.1 to 1.2. But as long as the R figure is greater than 1, the virus can spread exponentially.

Let’s say a community has gotten its R value down to 1. Then a 50 percent more transmissible variant comes along. It could mean that the same mitigation effort that got the old variant of the virus down to 1 now only gets it down to 1.5.

Which is to say: To combat a more transmissible version of the virus, communities need even more stringent controls.

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Let’s say a community has the virus more or less under control. The R value in the area is 1, which means the number of cases in the area remains constant, month to month.

In this scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, and you’ll have 1,000 cases a month from now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes it takes about five days for one infection to cause another). “Now let’s imagine the virus is 50 percent more transmissible. .... 1,000 cases of such a virus now would translate to more than 10,000 cases a month from now if you did nothing!”

A more transmissible virus increases the number of people who need to be vaccinated

A more transmissible virus also increases the threshold for herd immunity, or the rough estimate of the percentage of people in a population who need to achieve immunity, ideally via a vaccination, in order for the outbreak to decrease in size.

Herd immunity thresholds are dependent on the value of R. The higher the R value, the higher the threshold. If a more transmissible variant becomes dominant the world over, it increases pressure on vaccination campaigns to vaccinate even more people. Already, it’s looking like upward of 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to achieve herd immunity (though the exact figure needed is unknown). That’s already an extremely high and difficult bar to clear, given the slow early distribution of the vaccines.

There’s also the yet-to-be-realized possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that reduces the efficacy of the current vaccines.

A more transmissible virus means more death

One good piece of news about the B.1.1.7 variant: So far, it doesn’t seem to be any deadlier than older variants of the virus. That is: Any individual who gets it isn’t any more likely to end up in the hospital or die, according to the early data.

But more infections mean more death. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Switzerland, says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

A 50 percent more contagious virus is even a deadlier concern than one that’s 50 percent more deadly, as London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains on Twitter.

If a city has an R value of 1.1 and there are 10,000 people infected, in one month’s time, you’d expect to see 129 deaths, he says.

Increase the deadliness of the virus by 50 percent in that scenario and you’d expect 193 deaths — a 49.6 percent increase.

Increase the contagiousness of the virus in this scenario by 50 percent and you get 978 deaths, Kucharski finds. That’s a 658 percent increase. That’s a theoretical calculation, but the central point is the exponential effect, as Kucharski explains.

The above is just an illustrative example, but the key message: an increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity). 5/5 — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) December 28, 2020

It’s not entirely clear if this will come to pass

Again, the estimate of 50 percent increased transmissibility is just an estimate. And even if new variants are more transmissible, it could be hard to predict how much more transmissible it will be in different locations.

Hanage stresses that the 50 percent more transmissible figure being reported is based on how this variant behaves in the UK. In a different place — with different adherences to social distancing, different mitigation measures in place — the new variant could behave differently. It’s complicated, yes, but that’s outbreaks for you.

But even the hypothetical threat of a more transmissible variant is a call for action.

To stop more mutations from happening, to stop more potentially problematic variants from popping up, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, told me in a December interview. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

The new variant mean our individual actions matter more than ever. This variant spreads in the same manner as other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the same precautions apply. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and ventilation are as important as ever.

With the new variant around, Lipsitch says, “Your isolation and quarantine and contact tracing is considerably more important, even more than it was before. So you’re doing more for the world.”",voxdotcom,"['r', 'epidemiologists', 'means', 'thats', 'virus', 'covid19', 'worried', 'charts', 'variant', '50', 'variants', 'transmissible', 'cases', 'number']",0
2021-01-16 19:25:07+00:00,22,"Nurse Elisheva Gasner reports for her shift about twice a week at Jerusalem’s Pais Arena, a sports stadium that has been transformed into a massive Covid-19 vaccination center. Patients arrive at the arena, swipe their insurance cards, and get a number. When their number is called, ushers escort them to vaccine booths where medics, doctors, and nurses like Gasner deliver shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine into their arms.

“We call it an operation — like an army operation,” Gasner told me last week. “It’s just orderly, and everyone is feeling good and excited.”

Israel leads the world in vaccination rate per capita. It’s been less than a month since its vaccination campaign began on December 19, and more than 20 percent of the country’s population of about 9 million have already gotten the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine as of January 14. In total, it’s about 2 million people.

Over the past few weeks, the country delivered shots to about 150,000 people per day. Priority went to people over 60 and health workers; however, in an attempt to avoid wasting any shots that might spoil, other Israelis got the vaccine if they happened to know the right clinic or happened to be in the right place at the right time.

Israel’s rapid campaign worked almost too well: The country soon began running low on doses, which threatened to slow the pace of new vaccinations. Israel also committed to reserving a second dose for everyone who received the first. Follow-up appointments are scheduled for 21 days after the first jab, often to the exact day, sometimes the hour.

But on January 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the country had reached an agreement with Pfizer to deliver more vaccines, with the goal of inoculating all citizens over the age of 16 by the end of March. With more than 70 percent of people over 60 already vaccinated, Netanyahu said Sunday that the campaign would soon expand to include all people 50 and older, and strive for 170,000 inoculations each day.

“We will be the first country in the world to emerge from the coronavirus,” Netanyahu said in a Friday statement about the campaign, called “Operation Getting Back to Life.” The prime minister himself received his second shot on Sunday.

Israel’s small population and existing health infrastructure — a universal, digitized system that makes it easy to keep track of and communicate with patients — have much to do with the country’s vaccination success.

Israel is also facing yet another election in March. An aggressive vaccination rollout will likely be a boost to Netanyahu ahead of that contest, and potentially help overshadow other public health failures that have happened on his watch during the pandemic.

But experts and officials I spoke to said the immunization campaign also benefited from Israel’s ability to react quickly in a crisis. “We are very good in improvising,” Gabi Barbash, a public health expert at the Weizmann Institute and director general emeritus of Israel’s Health Ministry, told me. “Israel is not very good at long-term planning,” Barbash said, but “it’s very good in responding to the immediate challenge.”

Israel’s vaccination efforts are unfolding alongside a rapid increase in coronavirus cases, forcing the country to tighten its nationwide lockdown on January 8 for at least two weeks. Positive Covid-19 cases in the country have reached their highest levels at any point since the start of the pandemic, with around 7,000 people testing positive each day.

It’s an example of the world’s split screen right now: the promise of a vaccine to slow and end the pandemic next to a devastating surge of cases in many parts of the world, in some places driven by a troubling new mutation of the virus.

The precariousness of the moment means Israel can’t claim victory yet. Gasner described it as feeling “a bit strange,” this spike in new cases alongside this undeniable feeling of triumph, of relief. She vaccinated a 100-year-old woman the other day, she told me, and last week, Gasner’s roommate planned to escort her 70-something neighbor to a vaccination appointment at Pais Arena. The neighbor had specifically requested that Gasner give her the shot.

“These people hadn’t left their homes in nine months, and they’re very excited to be able to see their grandchildren, and have human contact,” Gasner said. “They see the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Israel’s health care system provided the infrastructure to make this work

Tali Prilutski, a 23-year-old social work student who works at the Hadassah Medical Center, a major hospital system in Jerusalem, received her first injection of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at the end of December. She called a hotline for workers at the hospital, and they gave her an appointment time — something oddly specific, she recalls, like 2:53 pm.

“I already know when to come back” for the second shot, she said. “The same hour, the same place.” As Prilutski put it, this is the easiest way. People know exactly what comes next and where to go.

A big reason why Israel can do this is because the infrastructure to pull this off already existed.

Israel has a universal health care system: All Israeli citizens are enrolled in one of four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for their care. The system is digitized, and everyone has an ID number, which allows for easy access to electronic records — and a simple way to find everyone who’s 60 or above, in the current vaccination priority group. This system also allows health care workers to update a person’s vaccination status, monitor any side effects, and schedule an appointment for the next dose.

The HMOs, then, were the most efficient delivery system to get the vaccine out into the communities, employing their nurses, doctors, and other medical professionals to deliver the shots. “The minute [the HMOs] got information from the Ministry of Health on how to give the vaccines, they started organizing the employees and the infrastructure they had on how to do it the best way,” Orna Baron-Epel, a professor of public health promotion at the University of Haifa, told me.

The HMOs also designated vaccination sites across the country, places that were accessible and big enough to be able to space people out and keep them as socially distanced as possible. Arenas like the Pais, where Gasner worked in Jerusalem, or Rabin Square, in the center of Tel Aviv. Theaters and cultural centers, otherwise empty because of pandemic restrictions, were converted to vaccination sites. Baron-Epel told me about a park in the city of Ra’anana, where an HMO rented a place near an artificial lake so people could wait outside for their shots. The Health Ministry and HMOs also worked to get shots to nursing homes.

Communication has been another key element of the vaccine response: instructing people exactly where to go and when. Experts said Israel’s digitized health system also means patients can use the same information systems they use for primary care to get vaccination information. Israelis are accustomed to getting communications via text message in general, including from the HMOs, which further helped facilitate communication about vaccination.

For older Israelis, who may be less able to navigate the technology, call centers were set up, and in many cases, the local branch of one of the HMOs would directly call residents and tell them when and where to come and vaccinated, according to Asher Salmon, head of the International Relations Department at the Ministry of Health in Israel.

“The idea is that you get vaccinated, and you get vaccinated again, at the same time and same place after three weeks,” Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist at Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health, who plans to stand as a candidate in Israeli’s upcoming election, told me.

“And for that,” he said, “you need people to be informed, you need to have a good communication system, like we do for the hospitals and HMOs that you get through SMS.”

Levine joked that even he had to commit in advance to his second dose, with the nurse telling him, “Sorry, the date is automatically scheduled.” This, he said, worked as a really important nudge to get people to come back for that critical second dose that will provide fuller protection.

But the two-dose regime required for the Pfizer vaccine (and others, like the one from Moderna) does present a real logistical and operational challenge, experts told me. About 100,000 Israelis have already received their second dose, according to the Ministry of Health, but the second wave of injections will be the real test of just how well Israel’s vaccine program is working.

Israel tried to keep things simple yet flexible

Robbie Strazynski started to see the selfies popping up on Facebook of friends declaring their newly vaccinated statuses. The 39-year-old father and founder of a poker blog wanted to know how they did it — how he could get one, too.

They told him that if he went to a vaccination site on a Friday, he might be able to snag a leftover dose, which, if not used by a certain time period, would spoil and be tossed out.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be stored at minus 70°C (minus 94°F) or lower, and its delivery requires a complicated “cold chain” to preserve its integrity. Before use, the vaccine must be thawed and refrigerated at 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F) for no more than 120 hours. The vials must then be diluted before they can be administered, and if they’re not used, have to be discarded after 6 hours. That limited shelf life at various stages of the process means it’s basically “use it or lose it.” With the Covid-19 pandemic raging and not even close to enough vaccine supply to meet the worldwide demand, it is the worst kind of waste.

So Strazynski, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Karnei Shomron, went on Friday, January 1, to try to get a vaccine. He was No. 36 in a line of a hundreds. He waited 2½ hours in line to get the vaccine, though he would have waited 12 hours if he had to.

But he did get it. Shortly after, he received a text message with his second-dose appointment three weeks out. “I can actually see this light,” Strazynski told me. “I know exactly where the end of the tunnel is, at least for me.”

Strazynski wasn’t the only one searching for a spare shot. Facebook and WhatsApp groups have cropped up with Israelis sharing tips and advice on how to find leftover vaccines. And while Israel prioritized those over 60, it made the policy flexible enough to avoid as much waste as possible.

“That no-waste policy literally means that the nurse, when she’s got 10 vaccines left, hollers at the pizza guy, or the guy at the bus stop, and says, ‘Hey you, come in and get your vaccine,’” Michal Cotler-Wunsh, a member of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), told me.

Israel’s health infrastructure makes this kind of organized chaos possible. Even if you’re the pizza guy on the street, or you’re escorting your grandmother to her vaccine appointment and there’s a dose available for you, you’ll quickly be logged into the system and get the same follow-up as everyone else.

“For a vaccination campaign, we are well-prepared, but we’re also flexible,” Levine said. “When you plan, you don’t know, for example, how the cold chain will look, how many vaccines you will get — so you need to make rapid adjustments. And we are good at that.”

Israel wants to be a model for the world. Can it be?

Prime Minister Netanyahu received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this weekend, a sort of official kickoff to the next round of vaccinations. Prior to that, he’d announced a deal with Pfizer to receive new shipments of dosages, enough to vaccinate the entire population by March.

The details of the deal with Pfizer are not fully public, and there’s been some criticism that Israel has paid more for doses than other countries. (A spokesperson for Israel’s Ministry of Health declined to comment on record.) According to Politico, in exchange for more doses, Israel will provide information to both the company and the World Health Organization about the side effects experienced by those vaccinated and the vaccine’s efficacy, essentially helping to provide data on the long-term outlook of this Covid-19 immunization campaign.

Israel also approved the Moderna vaccine earlier this month, another two-shot regime that was reportedly supposed to be delivered this month.

Netanyahu declared that Israel will be a “global model state for the rapid vaccination of an entire country.” But how much Israel’s success can be replicated abroad is hard to say. Israel’s small and densely packed population has eased some of the logistical and operational challenges of delivering the vaccine. And Israel’s universal health care system, which has easily accessible records for all citizens, has massively facilitated the program.

Many countries where the virus is raging lack one or both of these attributes. The United States, which has struggled with its vaccination rollout, has neither — which is partly why the campaign has, so far, fallen short of its immunization goals. The rollout has been largely delegated to states and localities, which has led to uneven distribution and confusion on the requirements for who gets the jab when — all of which increases the possibility of wastage.

Israel’s rollout has also not been without controversy.

In particular, Israel has faced criticism from human rights groups for excluding Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from the vaccination campaign, despite making the shots available to Israeli settlers in the West Bank.

Israel says that based on the terms of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority is responsible for health care in the Palestinian territories. According to the Guardian, the Palestinian Authority had not asked for assistance early in the campaign.

But the Palestinian Authority doesn’t have anywhere near the resources Israel does. Though the territories are set to receive doses through the Covax facility, the WHO-linked international consortium, none have begun distribution yet. The Palestinian Authority also approved the Russian vaccine, though doses have not yet arrived.

Human rights and health groups are continuing to pressure Israel to “ensure that quality vaccines be provided to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation,” arguing that restrictions imposed by the occupation limit the Palestinian Authority’s purchasing and distribution capabilities.

And of course, Israel’s vaccination campaign can’t be at all divorced from politics. The Israeli governing coalition collapsed in December, leading to yet another election in March of 2021, the fourth in two years. A successful vaccination campaign, one that’s a world model, is undoubtedly a boost for Netanyahu, who can claim victory despite Israel’s larger struggle to control the pandemic and the prime minister’s own corruption scandals.

It might be that the last memory — this aggressive vaccination campaign — is the one that will stick with Israelis. “I think this, in a way, is going to amend for all mismanagement that we have seen over the course of the pandemic,” Barbash, the public health expert, said.

“But,” he added, “to be honest and fair: When you look, there is no one nation in the world that has been able to cope with this pandemic.”",voxdotcom,"['population', 'leading', 'health', 'israels', 'vaccine', 'campaign', 'vaccination', 'vaccinating', 'system', 'israel', 'second', 'world', 'told', 'hmos']",0
2021-01-16 18:05:44+00:00,57,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.



These are the latest weekly figures for number of incidents/outbreaks from @PHE_uk pic.twitter.com/92VXpFBATq — Dr Duncan Robertson (@Dr_D_Robertson) January 12, 2021

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0
2021-01-15 21:51:07+00:00,18,"For the nearly 100 million people around the world who’ve been infected with the coronavirus, new science offers some comfort: Reinfections appear to be rare, and you may be protected from Covid-19 for at least five months.

The study, the largest of its kind, followed more than 20,000 health workers in the UK, regularly testing them for infection and antibodies. Between June and November, the researchers — from Public Health England (PHE) — found 44 potential reinfections out of the 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies or had a previous positive PCR or antibody test when they joined the study. Meanwhile, of the 14,000-plus people who had tested negative for the virus at the start of the study, there were 409 new infections.

Only two of the 44 potential reinfections were designated “probable” and the rest were considered “possible,” “based on the amount of confirmatory evidence available,” according to the health agency. Fifteen people — or 34 percent — had symptoms.

So if all 44 reinfections are real, that translates to an 83 percent lower risk of reinfection compared to health workers who never had the virus. If only two are confirmed, that rate of protection goes up to 99 percent. Either way, it suggests natural immunity might provide a similar level of protection as the approved Covid-19 vaccines.

But as with the vaccines, it’s not yet clear how long immunity after an infection lasts. Antibodies may fade after five months or last much longer, something the researchers behind the ongoing study, which will run for a total of 12 months, plan to investigate.

“This [new] study does provide some comfort that naturally acquired antibodies are pretty effective in preventing reinfections,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at Yale University, told Vox. The findings also square with another paper on health workers, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December: Researchers found people who had Covid-19 antibodies were better protected from the virus for six months than people who did not.

Iwasaki added, “You can also interpret these data to mean that protection against reinfection is not complete — especially for people who had Covid during the first wave, say in March-April 2020.”

People who had the virus may still be able to pass it on if reinfected

The good news for individuals who have had Covid-19 also comes with a warning about the risk they can still pose to other people. While antibodies might protect against a second case of Covid-19 in most people, “early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests that some of these individuals carry high levels of virus and could continue to transmit the virus to others,” PHE warned in its press release.

“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total,” Susan Hopkins, a senior medical adviser at PHE and the study lead, said in a statement, “and we do not yet know how long protection lasts.”

In other words, even if you’ve had Covid-19, while you’re unlikely to get really sick again anytime soon, you should still consider yourself a potential risk of spreading it to others if you catch the virus again and are asymptomatic. That means continuing to take precautions — like mask-wearing and social distancing, Iwasaki added. And it’s one reason why immunologists have said people who’ve already been infected with the virus should still plan to get the vaccine when their turn comes.

So there’s still a lot more to learn about immunity after Covid-19: How will the new coronavirus variants affect it? Lab data from South Africa, where the 501Y.V2 variant has been spreading, suggests it might be able to escape antibodies produced by prior infections in some people.

Who is most likely to have a strong immune response? We do have some evidence that different individuals mount different antibody responses after Covid-19 infections, but the PHE researchers found no statistically significant difference in rates of protection between people who reported symptoms and those who did not. It’s also possible factors like gender and disease severity influence the strength of a person’s immune response.

For now, though, the research suggests that survivors of the virus might just help us get to herd immunity faster — if their immunity lasts long enough. But given the virus has only been known to humans for a little over a year, it may take a while to authoritatively answer the question.",voxdotcom,"['reinfections', 'natural', 'virus', 'covid19', 'health', 'antibodies', 'protection', 'researchers', 'suggests', 'immunity', 'study', 'months']",0
2021-01-15 21:29:41+00:00,6,"President-elect Joe Biden announced a plan on Friday for what will likely be his most pressing challenge when he takes the White House next week: fixing America’s messy Covid-19 vaccine rollout.

The plan builds on Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic stimulus proposal, which included a $400 billion Covid-19 plan, announced on Thursday. It seeks more support to states and lower levels of government, a greater expansion of vaccine eligibility, funding for more public health workers, a boost in vaccine production, better communication about the vaccines, an education and awareness campaign, and more. He promises 100 million vaccine doses delivered in his first 100 days in office.

Above all, the plan aims for something that President Donald Trump’s administration didn’t do with Covid-19 more broadly and the vaccine in particular: greater federal involvement. The Trump administration has repeatedly pushed against a bigger federal role — even characterizing more support for states so they can get shots in arms as a “federal invasion.” Biden has rejected that rhetoric, calling for a bigger role by the feds, and cementing it with his plan.

The stakes are as high as they’ve ever been. The country now averages 240,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 3,300 deaths each day. The American death toll is among the worst in the world, with the country now approaching a total of 400,000 dead. If the US had the same death rate per million people as Canada, over 230,000 more Americans would likely be alive today.

The vaccine is America’s — and the world’s — chance at fixing this mess. Experts say the country must vaccinate at least 70 percent of its population, and possibly more, to reach herd immunity and protect a sufficient amount of the population from the virus. Only then can outbreaks truly be curbed.

But the US has been slow in rolling out a vaccine. The Trump administration overpromised and underdelivered: It promised 40 million doses and 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020; two weeks into 2021, only 31 million does have been delivered and just 11 million Americans have received at least the first dose of a vaccine, according to federal data. The country is currently not on track to reach 70-plus percent vaccination rates by the end of the summer.

Biden’s immediate challenge is to clean this all up. His presidency may count on it — his handling of the country’s most pressing crisis will likely be what Americans judge him on over the next year.

More seriously, it’s a matter of life or death: With thousands of people dying each day, ending the epidemic in the US even days or weeks earlier than otherwise could save up to tens or hundreds of thousands of lives.

Here’s how Biden plans to do it.

What Biden’s vaccine plan does

Biden promises to leverage “the full strength of the federal government,” in partnership with state, local, and private organizations, for a truly national vaccine plan. You can read the full proposal here, but these are some of the key points:

More federal work to get shots to people : Biden calls for more involvement by the federal government in getting vaccine doses to people. That includes new vaccination centers, mobile vaccination units in underserved communities, reimbursement of states’ National Guard deployments, and expanding vaccine availability in pharmacies. He also promises to target hard-to-reach, marginalized communities with extra support, particularly those that have been hit the hardest by Covid-19.

He also promises to target hard-to-reach, marginalized communities with extra support, particularly those that have been hit the hardest by Covid-19. Boost the supply of vaccines : Biden says he’ll make greater use of federal powers, such as the Defense Production Act, to boost the manufacture of vaccines and related supplies. He also says he’ll improve communication with states so they can better understand when and how much vaccine they can expect to get — addressing a big complaint from states today, as the Trump administration has often failed to inform them of even these basic details.

Expanded vaccine eligibility : Biden calls for expanding vaccine eligibility to include everyone 65 and older as well as frontline essential workers, including teachers, first responders, and grocery store employees. Several states have already moved in this direction, but Biden promises more support and encouragement toward this objective.

Mobilize a larger public health workforce : Building on his stimulus plan, Biden vows to hire and use a larger public health workforce to help deploy the vaccine across the country. He’ll also take other steps, like allowing retired medical professions who aren’t currently licensed under state law to help administer vaccines “with appropriate training.”

He’ll also take other steps, like allowing retired medical professions who aren’t currently licensed under state law to help administer vaccines “with appropriate training.” Launch a national public education campaign: To help convince people to get vaccinated, Biden also plans to launch an education campaign “that addresses vaccine hesitancy and is tailored to meet the needs of local communities.”

All of that is on top of Biden’s broader Covid-19 plan, which promises $400 billion more funds to combat the coronavirus and, specifically, $20 billion more for vaccine efforts.

Biden’s plan hits many of the marks that I’ve heard from experts over the past few weeks as I’ve asked them about what’s going wrong with America’s vaccine rollout.

First, the plan has clear goals to address what supply chain experts call the “last mile” — the path vaccines take from storage to injection in patients — by making sure there’s enough staff, infrastructure, and planning to actually put shots in arms. Second, it takes steps to ensure that supply chain problems are fixed proactively, with careful monitoring and use of federal powers when needed to address bottlenecks. Last, but just as crucially, there’s a public education campaign to ensure that Americans actually want to get vaccinated when it’s their turn.

The question, of course, is if all of this can get implemented properly. As the US response to Covid-19 has floundered, a key question has been how much of the failure is attributable just to Trump versus bigger systemic problems, like the country’s size and sprawl, fractured health care system, and fragmented federalist government.

There’s also the question of whether Biden can get the congressional support needed for all these efforts. Democrats will control both houses of Congress. But more moderate wings of the party may scoff at the high price tag: Biden’s stimulus plan is estimated at $1.9 trillion and the Covid-19 plan alone (which is included in the bigger plan) at $400 billion. The cost of borrowing money is low, and Biden argues that the risk right now is doing too little instead of too much, but it remains to be seen if he gets enough backing in Congress.

If he pulls it off, though, Biden has a chance to show how much of a difference true federal leadership can make — and demonstrate how much the previous administration failed by refusing to embrace a larger role for itself.

Biden wants a federal role that Trump disavowed

At the core of Biden’s plan is a posture of more federal involvement that Trump has resisted at every step throughout the Covid-19 crisis.

This was clear in Biden’s broader Covid-19 plan, too: The ideas in the proposal aren’t at all new. Experts have called for expanding testing, preparing for mass vaccination efforts, supporting schools, providing emergency paid leave, and much more in the past year. Biden himself proposed many of these things last March. You can see many of these ideas in article after article in Vox and elsewhere, dating back to early 2020.

The Trump administration declined more aggressive steps, repeatedly taking a stance that it wasn’t the federal government’s proper role to get hands-on with the Covid-19 response. With protective equipment, Trump resisted using the Defense Production Act to get more masks, gloves, and other gear to health care workers. On testing, the Trump administration left the bulk of the task to local, state, and private actors, describing the federal government as merely a “supplier of last resort.” On tracing, the administration never had anything resembling a plan to make sure the country could track down the sick or exposed and help them isolate or quarantine.

This kind of hands-off, leave-it-to-the-states attitude culminated in the messy vaccine rollout. While there are many factors contributing to America’s slow vaccine efforts — including the country’s size, sprawl, and fragmented health care system — a key contributor is the lack of federal involvement. In effect, the Trump administration purchased tens of millions of doses of the vaccines, shipped them to the states, and then left the states to figure out the rest.

This was clear in the funding numbers. State organizations asked for $8 billion to build up vaccine infrastructure. The Trump administration provided $340 million. Only in December did Congress finally approve $8 billion for vaccine distribution, but experts say that money comes late, given that vaccination efforts are already well underway and the funds could’ve helped in the preparation stages.

When asked about the botched vaccine rollout, the Trump administration has stuck to its anti-federalist stance — arguing that it’s on states and localities to figure out how they can vaccinate more people. Brett Giroir, an administration leader on Covid-19 efforts, argued, “The federal government doesn’t invade Texas or Montana and provide shots to people.”

Characterizing greater federal support for Covid-19 efforts as a federal invasion is of course absurd, but it’s emblematic of the Trump administration’s approach to the crisis.

On vaccines, as with the coronavirus in general, Biden’s promise has long been that he’ll embrace a bigger role for the federal government. With his plan, Biden is putting some specific details to that end. The question now is if he can pull it off — if he gets the support he needs from Congress, and if the feds really can deliver what Biden has promised.",voxdotcom,"['plan', 'explained', 'federal', 'biden', 'trump', 'administration', 'fix', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'bidens', 'states', 'support', 'rollout', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-15 17:00:14+00:00,15,"America’s messy Covid-19 vaccination campaign should provide one overarching lesson for policymakers: Keep it simple.

In the lead-up to the vaccine, federal and state governments established priority groups for the vaccine. In the very first phase, vaccines would go to health care workers and nursing home residents. After, vaccines would go to front-line essential workers, older populations, and people with medical conditions that put them at a greater risk for Covid-19. The list of people eligible would expand from there.

It seemed simple enough, but then reality brought complications. Just giving vaccines to health care workers raised all sorts of issues: Do all health care workers get a vaccine? Does that include staff who never interact with any patients at all, or should other staff get priority? Do staff who regularly interact with Covid-19 patients get extra priority — and what does “regularly” mean?

These kinds of questions have led the feds and states down to an enormously complicated process: “Phase 1” has been broken down into phase 1a, 1b, and 1c, and each state has built out its own definitions and guidelines for every step.

The complexity has slowed things down. Out of the 30 million vaccine doses sent out by the federal government, only 11 million first doses have been administered. Even if states are holding half their supply for the second dose the current vaccines require (which the feds no longer recommend), that’s still millions of vaccines going unused.

President Donald Trump’s administration promised the US would vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020. The country has breached only half of that two weeks into 2021. Other countries are vaccinating much faster, eclipsing the US entirely or catching up after a later start.

California’s health and human services secretary, Mark Ghaly, acknowledged the role of the state’s complex rollout, saying the state’s “really thoughtful” guidelines “led to some delays in getting vaccine out into our communities.”

“I will say that certain states that have put a great deal of effort into coming up with their priority groups, watching how we keep a keen eye on equity, have been in the same place where California is,” Ghaly added.

For some experts, the troubled rollout has led them to a piece of advice to US officials: embrace simplicity. Instead of trying to fine-tune theoretically perfect but increasingly complicated vaccine plans, US officials should give more priority to getting vaccines out as quickly as possible — even if it’s less equitable in theory (though not necessarily in practice, since more complexity often enables more gaming of the system).

To put it simply: Worry less about whether the ideal population is getting vaccinated and more about actually vaccinating people.

“A massive vaccination campaign won’t work with our current fussy and intricate criteria for who gets a shot and when,” Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at Baylor College of Medicine, wrote. “We learned in 2020 that our health system simply cannot do complicated things.”

That doesn’t mean opening the floodgates and letting everyone get the vaccine. For one, the limited supply of doses won’t allow that for now. The idea is to find another, but simpler, standard. For example, age: Provide vaccines to older populations first, then work down to younger and younger people. This would still target those at highest risk of death — older age is a big predictor of Covid-19 fatality — and it’d be much more straightforward.

Some states, like New York and California, have moved in this direction by letting people 65 and older get the vaccine. But these states aren’t stratifying this process within the 65-and-up group, and there’s currently not enough supply to meet the demand.

A simpler rollout that speeds things up could save thousands of lives. Daily new coronavirus cases now average around 240,000 in the US, with more than 3,300 people dying a day from the coronavirus. With every day that this continues, the US experiences a higher Covid-19 death toll in 24 hours than the number of people who died in the 9/11 attacks.

Complexity is slowing down vaccinations

The current round of Covid-19 vaccinations was supposed to be the easy part.

With the first phase of vaccination, the country has the advantage of knowing where people who should get the first doses are: in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. That’s a sharp contrast to the later phases, in which would-be beneficiaries will come from more diverse places, jobs, and backgrounds. That’s why some experts expected the first phase would go at least a little smoothly, even if not perfectly.

Then the US began rolling out its plans in the real world. Vaccine doses were sent to the states slower than expected, but a continuing problem is that localities and states aren’t even using the majority of the doses they have. There are reports of health care workers and facilities throwing out doses because they can’t find people in priority groups in time.

Some state officials, like California’s Ghaly, admit they’ve been slowed down by their own guidelines. Brown University School of Public Health dean Ashish Jha, who’s advised state officials on Covid-19, told me he’s heard similar complaints. “The recurring theme is that complexity is proving really hard for them,” he said.

Some of that comes down to extra administrative work. For example, some places have tried to prioritize not just health care workers but frontline health care workers who see Covid-19 patients. That makes sense in theory, but in practice it’s required more hurdles, from paperwork to verification to penalties for line-cutters.

The emphasis on complex guidelines has also led to a rigid emphasis on following the rules. Some officials made this explicit, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who threatened health care providers that vaccinate people who don’t meet the state’s criteria with big fines. But it’s also the implication of the guidelines — after all, states wouldn’t spend so much time on these criteria if they didn’t want people to follow them.

The result is a mix of slowdowns in getting vaccines out and discarded doses as people don’t meet narrow guidelines. It’s a big contrast to Israel, which has vaccinated at about seven times the rate as the US in part by embracing flexibility, even if that means giving a vaccine to a pizza guy because he’s the only person vaccinators could find at the time.

“There’s a trade-off between speed and efficacy,” Kendall Hoyt, a vaccine and biosecurity expert at Dartmouth, told me. “If we’re going for the perfect solution to such a degree that we have to throw out doses at the end of the day, then we’re failing.”

Things will likely get messier moving forward. As the vaccine starts to roll out to broader populations, it’s going to become more difficult to verify who qualifies and who doesn’t. Who is a frontline essential worker? How does a vaccinator verify that a person actually holds a job that qualifies? If vaccinators rely entirely on an honor system, what happens when people who really want to get vaccinated realize that they can just lie and cut the line? If vaccinators don’t use the honor system and set up requirements, will people avoid getting a vaccine so they don’t have to deal with cumbersome paperwork?

Further complicating this, state plans use different definitions for who is a frontline worker. Some states currently limit the category to K-12 school staff, first responders, and not much more than that, while others embrace a broader criteria that can include even journalists. As Jennifer Kates, Jennifer Tolbert, and Josh Michaud at the Kaiser Family Foundation concluded, “Because of these differences, for this next period, a person’s place in the COVID-19 vaccine priority line will increasingly depend on where they live.”

All of this will create more work for the vaccinators themselves, but also make it more difficult for the supposed beneficiaries of all of this — the people getting vaccinated — to even know if it’s their turn. And unlike people who work in health care settings or live in nursing homes, these targeted groups won’t all be under one roof. That will reduce the chances people get vaccinated quickly, further slowing down a process that’s already too slow.

Meanwhile, thousands of Americans will die instead of getting the vaccine that could have saved their lives.

How to embrace simplicity with vaccines

For the feds and states, the reasoning for all the complicated guidelines was equity and public trust — showing that the process wasn’t built to benefit the powerful and wealthy over everyone else.

But the current process may achieve the opposite. When there are more complicated rules, the people who have more time and resources are better able to game them. It’s the powerful and wealthy who’ll have an easier time finding a doctor who’ll give them a note saying a medical condition qualifies them for vaccination (or have a doctor at all), or find an employer to put them on payroll so they can qualify as a frontline worker.

“They’re really thoughtful plans, but they’re implemented in a society with deep structural inequities,” Jha said. “And the end product of that is going to be inequitable distribution.”

It’s not too late to fix the rollout, making it both easier to understand and harder to game. And by doing that, states could actually foster equity and public trust.

One idea: After health care workers and nursing home residents, use age as the primary guideline. So people 85 and up would get vaccines, then 75 and up, then 65 and up, then 55 and up, and so on. This would acknowledge that, while the virus can kill people in any age category, the older are more vulnerable: Victims 55 and older make up more than 90 percent of Covid-19 deaths.

Jha, with University of California, San Francisco, Department of Medicine chair Bob Wachter, suggested using a lottery system after people 55 and older get vaccinated, perhaps one that “selects a number at random every two weeks, corresponding to the month or last digit of people’s birthdays.” That’s fairly straightforward, but also makes it hard to game the system or otherwise make it feel unfair.

Alternatively, the rollout could continue going down age bands: to 45 and up, 35 and up, and so on, all the way down to children (if approved for use in kids). That maintains a bit more simplicity, although it’d slow down when younger people, who can still spread the disease, get the vaccine.

Another idea, from Shan Soe-Lin and Robert Hecht at Yale, is to focus on coronavirus hot spots. States would look at places with the highest rates of Covid-19 cases, then saturate those areas with mass vaccination centers, mobile units, and other resources. Once those places reach 60 to 70 percent vaccination rates, the next tier could be targeted. This would require more logistical work than an age approach, but it could also slow transmission more quickly and, therefore, help save more lives.

In explaining the proposal, Soe-Lin told me, “We could see that the next phase was going to be way too complicated. Our point was to simplify it.”

In keeping things simple, these plans are easier to explain and justify. Everyone can understand why older populations or people in hot spots might need vaccines more. Focusing on one of those categories instead of multiple avoids the vast considerations of current priority groups. And these categories are more difficult for individuals to game than, say, a doctor’s note or place of employment.

No one claims these ideas are perfect. A notable gap is they don’t offer extra priority to frontline workers who really may be exposed more to Covid-19, minority groups who’ve suffered more from the coronavirus, or the immunocompromised. Jha said one way to alleviate such concerns may be to target places where, say, people of color live with vaccine centers or mobile units — not to put them ahead in line, but to ensure they can get vaccines quickly when it’s their turn.

But chasing the perfect — at the cost of more and more complexity — is what got us into the current mess and what’s likely to make the rollout even messier going forward. It’s not going to be a lot of people’s ideal, but that’s the point: To get vaccines out as quickly as possible, save more lives, and get America back to normal faster, the country should think less about the ideal and instead embrace simplicity — prioritizing a quicker, more efficient vaccination campaign above all else.",voxdotcom,"['americas', 'older', 'covid19', 'complicated', 'vaccine', 'health', 'workers', 'doses', 'priority', 'care', 'states', 'rollout', 'way', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-15 14:20:06+00:00,23,"For the nearly 100 million people around the world who’ve been infected with the coronavirus, new science offers some comfort: Reinfections appear to be rare, and you may be protected from Covid-19 for at least five months.

The study, the largest of its kind, followed more than 20,000 health workers in the UK, regularly testing them for infection and antibodies. Between June and November, the researchers — from Public Health England (PHE) — found 44 potential reinfections out of the 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies or had a previous positive PCR or antibody test when they joined the study. Meanwhile, of the 14,000-plus people who had tested negative for the virus at the start of the study, there were 409 new infections.

Only two of the 44 potential reinfections were designated “probable” and the rest were considered “possible,” “based on the amount of confirmatory evidence available,” according to the health agency. Fifteen people — or 34 percent — had symptoms.

So if all 44 reinfections are real, that translates to an 83 percent lower risk of reinfection compared to health workers who never had the virus. If only two are confirmed, that rate of protection goes up to 99 percent. Either way, it suggests natural immunity might provide a similar level of protection as the approved Covid-19 vaccines.

But as with the vaccines, it’s not yet clear how long immunity after an infection lasts. Antibodies may fade after five months or last much longer, something the researchers behind the ongoing study, which will run for a total of 12 months, plan to investigate.

“This [new] study does provide some comfort that naturally acquired antibodies are pretty effective in preventing reinfections,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at Yale University, told Vox. The findings also square with another paper on health workers, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December: Researchers found people who had Covid-19 antibodies were better protected from the virus for six months than people who did not.

Iwasaki added, “You can also interpret these data to mean that protection against reinfection is not complete — especially for people who had Covid during the first wave, say in March-April 2020.”

People who had the virus may still be able to pass it on if reinfected

The good news for individuals who have had Covid-19 also comes with a warning about the risk they can still pose to other people. While antibodies might protect against a second case of Covid-19 in most people, “early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests that some of these individuals carry high levels of virus and could continue to transmit the virus to others,” PHE warned in its press release.

“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total,” Susan Hopkins, a senior medical adviser at PHE and the study lead, said in a statement, “and we do not yet know how long protection lasts.”

In other words, even if you’ve had Covid-19, while you’re unlikely to get really sick again anytime soon, you should still consider yourself a potential risk of spreading it to others if you catch the virus again and are asymptomatic. That means continuing to take precautions — like mask-wearing and social distancing, Iwasaki added. And it’s one reason why immunologists have said people who’ve already been infected with the virus should still plan to get the vaccine when their turn comes.

So there’s still a lot more to learn about immunity after Covid-19: How will the new coronavirus variants affect it? Lab data from South Africa, where the 501Y.V2 variant has been spreading, suggests it might be able to escape antibodies produced by prior infections in some people.

Who is most likely to have a strong immune response? We do have some evidence that different individuals mount different antibody responses after Covid-19 infections, but the PHE researchers found no statistically significant difference in rates of protection between people who reported symptoms and those who did not. It’s also possible factors like gender and disease severity influence the strength of a person’s immune response.

For now, though, the research suggests that survivors of the virus might just help us get to herd immunity faster — if their immunity lasts long enough. But given the virus has only been known to humans for a little over a year, it may take a while to authoritatively answer the question.",voxdotcom,"['reinfections', 'natural', 'virus', 'covid19', 'health', 'antibodies', 'protection', 'researchers', 'suggests', 'immunity', 'study', 'months']",0
2021-01-15 04:49:06+00:00,76,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate.

2021-01-15 00:40:11+00:00,16,"President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled his opening bid on Covid-19 relief and economic recovery: a $1.9 trillion stimulus deal meant to help the United States address the health and economic crises induced by the pandemic.

The proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, is divvied up into three buckets: $400 billion for dealing with the coronavirus, including vaccines and testing; $1 trillion in direct relief to families; and $400 billion in aid to communities and businesses. It includes money for testing, vaccines, and public health workers; $400 a week in extended federal unemployment insurance through September; rental assistance; emergency paid leave; and funding for reopening schools, among other items.

And, as Democrats promised when campaigning in Georgia, Biden’s plan would send out another $1,400 in stimulus checks, bringing the total this year to $2,000.

“We need to tackle the public health and economic crises we’re facing head on,” Biden said in a tweet on Thursday. “That’s why today, I’m announcing my American Rescue Plan. Together, we’ll change the course of the pandemic, build a bridge toward economic recovery, and invest in racial justice.”

The incoming Biden administration is sorting its approach to the economy into two stages: rescue and recovery. This is the “rescue” part of the equation, meant to address the immediate crisis. The details on the recovery plank are still to come.

Lawmakers have already passed two sweeping Covid-19 relief bills, including the $2.2 trillion CARES Act in March and an additional $900 billion in relief in December. Biden’s proposal is a follow-up to those and signals a rather ambitious push on addressing the pandemic and the economy — even though the plan is likely to change before it’s signed into law, if it is at all.

Overall, this is a big deal. The $1.9 trillion in relief Biden is proposing is more than double the $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that Democrats passed in 2009 in the wake of the Great Recession. The size and scope of this proposal is a reflection of some lessons Democrats have learned: In 2009, many lawmakers believed they’d have a chance at another bill to deliver more help, but they never did. So the recovery was slower and more uneven than it could have been had they been more ambitious at the outset.

With that in mind, many Democrats and progressives plan to push the Biden administration and congressional leaders to go even further. Their mantra is that the real risk is doing too little — not too much.

“When Democrats passed the recovery act in 2009, it was smaller than was necessary, and a lot of members thought there was going to be another bite at the apple. There wasn’t,” one Democratic aide said. “Members who were around in that time period are very much cognizant of that lesson.”

What Biden wants done on the economy right now

Biden’s proposal for the American Rescue Plan is largely focused on immediate relief: measures necessary to help the country address the pandemic and its economic fallout. After all, the economy getting back to normal is contingent on getting the virus under control, which at this point means vaccinating as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.

Here’s a rundown of some of what Biden is proposing:

A national vaccination program and scaled-up testing. Biden is pushing to invest $20 billion in a national vaccination program in partnership with states, localities, tribes, and territories, including creating community vaccination centers and mobile vaccination units. He is also advocating for $50 billion to expand testing, including rapid tests, expanded lab capacities, and help for schools and local governments. And he is pushing for an additional $10 billion to manufacture pandemic supplies domestically, as well as $30 billion to the Disaster Relief Fund for supplies and protective gear.

A public health jobs program and funds toward addressing health disparities. Biden’s proposal looks to fund 100,000 health workers to expand the public health workforce. He also wants to increase funding for health services to underserved populations and those who live in congregate settings, such as nursing homes.

Money for reopening schools. Biden’s proposal calls for $130 billion to help schools reopen safely, $35 billion in funding for higher education, and $5 billion for governors to use to support educational programs for those hardest hit by Covid-19.

Emergency paid leave: Biden is calling for changes his team says will expand paid sick leave to 106 million more Americans, including renewing the expired requirement for employers to provide leave and expanding emergency paid leave to federal workers.

Bigger stimulus checks. Biden is proposing adding $1,400 to the latest round of stimulus checks so that they total $2,000. His plan also expands eligibility for the checks to adult dependents left out of previous rounds and to mixed-immigration status households.

Extended unemployment insurance. Under the current stimulus packages, the unemployed are eligible for an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits through March 14. Biden’s plan increases that amount to $400 through September and also continues extended benefits to people who have exhausted benefits or wouldn’t normally qualify, such as contractors or freelancers.

Housing assistance. The president-elect’s plan calls for extending eviction and foreclosure moratoriums through September, directing $30 billion toward rental assistance, and $5 billion in emergency assistance to secure housing for the homeless.

Food benefits. The plan includes extending the 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits through September, investing $3 billion in the special supplemental nutrition program for WIC, and providing US territories with $1 billion in nutritional assistance.

Child care assistance. The plan calls for a $25 billion emergency stabilization fund for child care providers and an additional $15 billion to the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program.

Tax credits for children and low–income workers. The plan expands the child tax credit — another important one for Democrats — to $3,000 per child up to age 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6. And, it increases the earned income tax credit from about $530 to $1,500 and expands eligibility.

Support for small business. Biden is proposing $15 billion in grants to hard-hit small businesses and leveraging $35 billion in government funds into $175 billion in loans and investment in small businesses.

Support for state and local governments. Biden’s plan calls on Congress to provide $350 billion in funds for state, local, and territorial governments. It’s framed as money that will help pay frontline workers, reopen schools, and get people vaccinated. It also requests $20 billion in relief for public transit agencies and $20 billion to support tribal governments’ pandemic response.

A $15 minimum wage. Biden’s proposal asks Congress to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour as well as ending the tipped minimum wage and sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities. It also calls on employers to provide hazard pay.

This is an opening bid, and some Democrats want to go bigger

Biden’s proposal is likely just the beginning of Democratic debate on how to bolster the country’s public health crisis response and economic recovery. More than nine months into the pandemic, thousands of people are dying each day of Covid-19, and millions of people are still out of a job.

“Given the urgency of the moment, I think there is a good argument for doing as much as possible as quickly as possible and continuing to push for more,” said Angela Hanks, deputy executive director of the progressive group Groundwork Collaborative, which released an estimate before last month’s stimulus bill was passed suggesting that it would take $3 trillion to $4.5 trillion to really get the economy moving.

Discussions are underway among Democrats and progressives inside and outside the legislative process about how to do more. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) sent a letter to Biden calling on his administration to push to include “baby bonds” in an economic recovery package. “We urge you to ‘go big,’ with a bold vision for racial and economic justice,” they wrote, arguing that baby bonds, which would create federally funded savings accounts for every child in America, “represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to close the racial wealth gap and unleash economic opportunity for every American.”

Student debt cancellation — an increasingly important issue on the left — is absent from Biden’s plan. Biden has said he supports Congress canceling $10,000 in federal student debt, but that’s not in Thursday’s proposal. He has come under pressure, including from many Democrats in the House and Senate, to cancel up to $50,000 of student debt.

That’s not the only thing Biden can do on his own. If he can’t get Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15, he could require federal contractors to pay a $15 minimum wage. There is a long list of actions he can take unilaterally to boost the economy, as well as putting people in place across the executive branch who can enact an agenda to create a fairer, more prosperous economic landscape. “There’s a lot that actually can absolutely be done without Congress,” said Felicia Wong, president and CEO of the Roosevelt Institute.

Biden’s plan nods at automatic stabilizers — tying social safety net mechanisms, such as expanded unemployment insurance, to certain economic conditions. That way, Congress doesn’t have to haggle about them all the time. But the idea is likely to get more attention in the coming weeks. A number of lawmakers have called for automatic stabilizers, including Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

“Ideally, you have a social safety net that exists to activate in times of crisis, and we don’t have to rely on policymakers to act just in time or after,” Hanks said. “It also means that in those moments of crisis, you’re not worrying about the immediate impact on things like unemployment insurance and you can focus on other areas you didn’t anticipate.” For example, like a pandemic.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is about to chair the Senate Budget Committee, has indicated he wants to go big from his new perch. That includes budget reconciliation, which could ultimately be the mechanism Democrats use if they can’t get enough Republicans on board with their agenda.

“It is absolutely imperative that the Congress not lose sight of the fact that working families in this country are facing more economic distress today than at any time during the Great Depression,” Sanders recently told Politico. “What Congress has got to show the American people is that … it can handle more than one crisis at a time.”

Budget reconciliation could be on the horizon

The general line from the Biden team and many Democratic lawmakers is that they want to give Republicans a chance to get on board with the agenda and pass Covid-19 relief through regular order, which would mean needing 60 votes to overcome a Senate filibuster. After all, that’s what happened throughout 2020. But if they can’t make it work, they’ll go another route.

“We need to know as early as we can, are [Republicans] serious about wanting this to go forward,” one Democratic aide said. “The disagreement will be how long we wait before we switch if we are going to be switching [tactics]. The best possible outcome here is that Republicans praise it and it’s bipartisan.”

Budget reconciliation — a process that exempts from the filibuster legislation primarily dealing with taxes and spending — is likely an option. (Vox has a full explainer on what it is.) In the current scenario, legislation passed under budget reconciliation could pass with 50 Senate Democratic votes plus tie-breaker Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

My colleague Dylan Matthews recently ran down a list of what Biden can do with budget reconciliation, and the rescue plan mostly includes items that are clearly doable under reconciliation. Experts say there are ways to finagle the rules to make almost of all it work.

“Looking through the Biden plan, as best I can tell, almost anything in it besides the minimum wage increase they can do through reconciliation,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He said there are a few areas where it could get tricky — namely, state and local aid and vaccination money. “They have to get a little creative, but it’s not even that hard.”

Democrats have two potential reconciliation bills to work with, one for the 2021 fiscal year and one for 2022. If they go that route, there will be a push on the left to make the proposal even bigger — that’s certainly, for example, what Sanders wants.

“I’m going to use reconciliation in as aggressive a way as I possibly can to address the terrible health and economic crises facing working people today,” he told Politico. That translates to spending on areas such as infrastructure, climate, and other parts of Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan.

But there are also moderate Democrats to contend with — getting to 50 votes means that the Joe Manchins and Kyrsten Sinemas of the world need to be on board. One Democratic policy adviser noted that a lot of the agenda is pretty uncontroversial, including expanded unemployment and state and local aid — among the caucus. Other elements, not so much. “It’s kind of a matter of what we think we can get away with and what we can push the envelope on and what we can convince 50 senators of, including our dear friend Mr. Manchin, on the floor,” the person said.

On a call with reporters earlier this week, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said he looked forward to soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer putting some legislation on the floor, in a test of whether soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans will take the same approach as under the Obama administration — obstruction at every turn. “If that’s his view of moving on anything, then we’ll have to find a way through reconciliation or something else. But I think you give them the chance,” Brown said.

Brown also said he believes there is “way more” consensus among Democrats than people may think. “My job is to find out what we can do together, find out what arguments work, are the most persuasive with them, and how I can figure out with them to make everything that we’ve come out with more palatable,” he said.

Biden and the Democratic Party are in a position many thought was unlikely after the November elections, when the probability of a double victory in Georgia’s Senate runoff elections seemed small: They have an opportunity to take some big swings at helping the economy, ultimately, helping people. Now we know what Biden’s opening bid to do that looks like. Over the days and weeks to come, the country will see how it plays out.",voxdotcom,"['joe', 'plan', 'explained', 'biden', 'covid19', 'health', 'proposal', 'stimulus', 'trillion', 'bidens', 'democrats', '19', 'economic', 'relief', 'billion', 'reconciliation']",0
2021-01-14 23:36:06+00:00,76,"Recent developments in the Covid-19 pandemic have exposed a grim reality: If we keep doing what we’re doing now to prevent infections, we’re screwed. Well, even more screwed.

That’s because the virus appears to be getting even better at infecting us. Since at least December, new, more contagious variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 have been outcompeting earlier versions of the virus in countries as far and wide as Brazil, the UK, and South Africa.

The advantage the new variants carry seems to be that in any given situation where people are gathered, they’ll infect more people — an estimated 30 to 70 percent more in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which has now been identified in 50 countries.

B.1.1.7 is already believed to be circulating at low levels across the US. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it has been detected in 10 states and is expected to become the most prevalent variant by March. And for a preview of what might come, look at how cases surged in the UK and nearby countries where this variant gained a foothold:

Even after a lockdown in the UK in November, the virus ripped through the population, overwhelming hospitals and forcing the government to implement even stricter stay-at-home orders by January.

While these variants haven’t been shown to be more deadly, a more transmissible virus is actually worse in many ways than a more lethal one. Cases snowball at a faster rate, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a recent press call. With a 50 percent rise in infectiousness, for example, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch said. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” The case growth could be even more dramatic, as Vox’s Brian Resnick reported.

More cases mean more really sick people, more strain on hospitals and health workers, more rationing of health care — and more deaths, including the entirely preventable ones now firmly linked to ICU bed shortages. More cases will also give the virus more opportunities to mutate further and potentially escape our vaccines, perpetuating the cycle of doom.

The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short.

“Shopping for five minutes in the grocery store is a lot better — six times better — than shopping for 30 minutes,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the odds of becoming infected rise the longer you’re exposed. “Picking up groceries at the curbside is even better, and having them delivered is even better still.” (If you’re able to get groceries delivered or pick up curbside, it will also help reduce the number of people in stores, potentially cutting the risk for essential workers or shoppers who can’t order online.)

It’s also time for governments to bring more urgency to what they should have been doing already — steps that could have an even greater impact than our individual actions: protecting at-risk groups by setting workplace standards, running inspections, offering programs like paid sick leave and paid isolation, and ensuring better masks for the population.

It’s time to avoid other people, even at the grocery store (if possible)

We know the virus can’t spread if we keep our distance from other people. But with the new variants, it might be even easier to catch.

The B.1.1.7 variant, for example, may generate a higher viral load in the respiratory tract of people who are infected, causing them to spew particles laden with even more virus into the air. Or the variant’s spike protein — the thorny edges on the surface that fit into the receptor in our cells — may be even “stickier,” meaning it’s even more effective at entering human cells.

We still don’t know the exact reason the virus variants appear to be more contagious, University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein told Vox, but we don’t have to wait for the answer. “The best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” he said. In other words, if you must meet others, a few minutes is much better than an hour or a few hours.

The activities we already knew were risky, like going to bars, eating in restaurants, or hanging out with friends at home, are probably even more so now. And even less risky indoor activities — going to a busy grocery store or pharmacy — could carry additional danger in contexts where the virus is spreading.

“Maybe if I’m in New Zealand [where new virus cases have mostly hovered below 20 per day for months], I can go get a haircut,” said Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who has studied Covid-19 mask effectiveness. “But I would not go in person to get a haircut if there’s a virus that’s 50 percent more transmissible spreading where I live.”

The emphasis here is on indoor activities. That’s because indoors is where most coronavirus transmission still takes place, even in the UK. In a recent report from Public Health England this week outlining where new cases of acute respiratory infections, including with the coronavirus, occurred, most popped up settings like workplaces, schools, long-term care homes, and hospitals.

There is a lot of chat about outdoor cycling and jogging.



But we need to focus on how to prevent transmission *indoors* - in care homes, workplaces, etc. That's where transmission takes place.

Concerns about going for a walk or run even in this scary new context are misplaced, experts say. “There seems to be a bit of a fuss about needing to be more wary of transmission outdoors, but I don’t know where that has come from,” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa. “Based on the evidence, we still think risk of transmission outdoors is very substantially less than indoors, and there’s no reason to believe the new variants change that equation substantially.”

But what is the likelihood of catching the virus outdoors? Contact tracing studies suggest that transmission risk is 20 times higher in indoor settings compared with outdoor environments. The risk is not zero but significantly lower. (4/n)

Get a better mask

When you do have to be around other people, use a mask — but not just any mask. The other lesson of the new variants, Frieden told Vox, is that we need to get better at masking.

“The fact that [the variants] are so infectious suggests to me having a better mask is a good idea,” Frieden said. When it comes to avoiding an infection, “a surgical mask is better than a cloth mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask is better than a loose-fitting mask, and an N95 is better than a surgical mask.”

Most Americans, however, still rely on cloth masks. Part of the problem is that the CDC continues to recommend cloth masks — what should have been a stopgap measure while the government procured better, medical-grade masks for citizens, Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard pointed out in the Atlantic.

This is a failure at a time when other countries around the world have managed to follow the evidence and get high-quality face coverings to people. It’s also an opportunity for the Biden administration to show leadership and learn from other countries.

In Austria, for example, the government is distributing FFP2 masks — the European equivalent of N95s — to citizens over the age of 65. In Taiwan, every citizen has access to new high-quality masks every week following the government’s manufacturing scale-up, Tufekci and Howard report. In Bavaria, Germany, the government has also boosted its mask supply and is mandating FFP2 masks on public transit and in stores.

If you can’t afford or access a higher-quality mask, Swann said, tight, well-fitting (cover that nose and mouth!) homemade masks with multiple layers are better than single-layer cloth masks. Similarly, double masking is better than single masking. And, of course, any mask is still better than no mask.

“But the best protection still remains avoiding contact with other people indoors, especially for a sustained period of time,” Goldstein added. “Masks are not 100 percent effective. Staying away from people is 100 percent effective.”

Employers and governments need to step it up fast

Of course, not everyone has the privilege of social distancing. From the United Kingdom to Sweden to Canada, we have evidence that the virus preys on people employed in “essential service” jobs (bus drivers, nurses, factory workers), which don’t allow for telecommuting or paid sick leave; people in low-income neighborhoods; and people in “congregate housing” like shelters, prisons, and retirement homes.

People of color tend to be overrepresented in these groups — but there’s no biological reason they’re more likely to get sick and die from the virus. Simply put: They tend to work jobs that take them outside the home and into close contact with other people, live in crowded environments ideal for coronavirus contagion, or both.

This means that, even when social distancing orders are in place, because of an individual’s work or living circumstances, they may be less able to physically distance. If they test positive, they may not be able to isolate themselves from family members or co-workers.

So policies like free testing, paid isolation, hazard pay, and paid sick leave are more important than ever — and the federal government also has a role to play in setting standards and carrying out inspections to ensure safety for workers. This is especially true in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons, where the virus is known to spread easily.

But business owners don’t need to wait on the government to intervene, Swann said. They should step up anti-virus measures now. For example, managers can ask employees who have just returned from holidays or other high-risk gatherings to self-quarantine for five days and then take a PCR test before coming to the office. “This gives time for an infection to have enough viral load to show up in test,” she said. Managers could also make sure workers avoid eating and socializing without masks, pay for testing, and consider supplying better masks for their employees.

Then there’s the vaccine. Early data from Israel, which now leads the world in Covid-19 vaccines per population, give us a preview of what might happen as more people are immunized. There, transmission is already slowing among people who got the shot. (Right now, the vaccines are still believed to work against the new variants or be adaptable to them, but more testing needs to be done.)

Related Why Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population

Most countries aren’t moving as quickly as Israel, and governments need to catch up in the race against the virus. Because if we continue doing everything the same way we’ve been doing at earlier stages of the pandemic, we’re going to help the virus get even better, and “the trajectory can get worse with a more transmissible variant,” Goldstein said. At a time when nearly 5,000 Americans are dying of the virus each day, anything worse is hard to fathom. But the point is: the situation doesn’t have to deteriorate. Even before governments announce new Covid-19 plans and programs and vaccines are injected into every possible arm, we can change the trajectory of the pandemic.",voxdotcom,"['spreading', 'masks', 'cases', 'transmission', 'mask', 'virus', 'store', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'going', 'need', 'dont', 'variants', 'stop', 'grocery']",0

2021-01-13 20:57:16+00:00,18,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

With coronavirus deaths now soaring in the US and several other countries, this prediction may be playing out: The crush of new Covid-19 hospital patients is probably leading to more deaths.

When intensive care units go from zero beds occupied to every bed full, patients have a 92 percent increased risk of death from Covid-19, according to a preprint published Wednesday on MedRxiv. (The paper has yet to be peer-reviewed.)

That means that when hospitals are pushed to maximum ICU capacity, the worst-case scenario is a near doubling of the risk of death for severely sick patients, the study found. For instance, a 40-year-old in a full intensive care unit would have the same risk of death as a 51-year-old, the study’s authors — researchers at UK institutions including Imperial College London, University College London, and the Wellcome Trust — estimated.

These risks fell along the gradient: As occupancy rates climbed higher, so did the risk of death. A second new preprint, analyzing data from nearly 20,000 Covid-19 patients in Israel, came to a similar conclusion:

The studies are particularly relevant at a time when more than one-fifth of hospitals with intensive care units in the US are reporting ICU bed occupancy levels of at least 95 percent and the daily coronavirus death count hit an all-time high (4,320 on January 13). The papers are also a grim reminder of why allowing the virus to run rampant is so dangerous, even as doctors have better treatments for the disease and vaccines are being rolled out worldwide.

“I’m saying [high] occupancy leads to mortality,” said Bilal Mateen, an author on the UK paper and a clinician-researcher who works at the Wellcome Trust and Kings College Hospital in London. “So that even if the virus isn’t directly killing you, indirect factors — like how full an ICU is on the day you arrive in hospital — are probably going to change your risk.”

Health workers are better at treating Covid-19 — but they need time and resources to do it

Covid-19 hospitalizations have exacted a heavy toll on hospital systems globally. But with all the terrible news about the pandemic, it’s easy to overlook the incredible amount of progress doctors have made in understanding and treating the disease.

Only a year ago, the medical community knew nothing of this new disease. Doctors thought they were dealing with a viral pneumonia that mainly affected the lungs. “We didn’t think about it as a whole-body viral assault — and yet that’s what we have,” Lewis Kaplan, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, told Vox in October. “There’s virtually no organ system — from skin to blood vessels to brain to nose — that is not implicated in one way or another.”

There’s still a lot to learn about Covid-19, but even this shift in understanding has come with improved medical care. Health workers now have numerous evidence-based tools at their disposal to save more lives. For example, there’s strong evidence that common steroids like dexamethasone can reduce the risk of mortality in severely sick in-patients. There is also strong evidence for monoclonal antibodies, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, which are typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.

Putting patients to rest on their stomachs instead of their backs (a practice known as proning) also seems to help, and certain kinds of convalescent plasma are showing promise.

Altogether, these medical advances are why — before the current case surge in the US and abroad — ICU doctors told Vox they generally expected their patients to survive the disease.

But health workers also warned that these gains could disappear as cases start piling up again and doctors, respiratory therapists, and nurses in hospitals become strained.

“When the hospital fills up, everything gets disrupted and a kind of ‘soft rationing’ kicks in,” Lakshman Swamy, who works with the Cambridge Health Alliance, told Vox. “The ICU has to raise the bar on how sick you need to be to get into the ICU. If you add stretched-out staff ... you end up basically providing slower, less ideal care to everyone, including the sickest patients.” And that can raise the risk of death for patients.

Governments need to prevent stress on hospitals

The new studies quantified the point at which deaths start increasing — and it doesn’t require hospitals reaching maximum capacity.

With the British preprint, Mateen and his colleagues used data from the first Covid-19 wave in the UK, from April to June, to model ICU occupancy — specifically, the number of patients in beds with ventilators — at the time a person was admitted to a hospital. They linked that occupancy data with the odds of survival for patients.

There were 4,032 patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in the study period. The researchers adjusted for patients’ comorbidities and age to make sure those factors weren’t affecting survival outcomes.

The study’s major finding: A patient admitted to the hospital when occupancy was higher than 85 percent had an almost 20 percent increased risk of death compared to those admitted when occupancy was around 45 percent. So even at occupancy rates of 85 percent, a patient’s risk of death had increased.

But going from zero percent ICU occupancy to 100 percent on the day of a patient’s admission was linked with the even more dramatic 92 percent increased risk of death.

“Every day we delay [strong anti-virus measures] in the context of occupancy being 90 something percent, there are probably people who are dying as a consequence,” said Mateen. As of January 7, 79 percent of ICU beds were occupied across the US, according to the New York Times, with one-fifth of hospitals with intensive care units reporting ICU bed occupancy levels of 95 percent or greater.

The researchers on the Israeli paper, which included all 19,336 Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Israel from mid-July 2020 to early January 2021, also adjusted for age and sex, as well as a patient’s health status on the first day of hospitalization. They found that even under conditions the Israeli government deems manageable for adequate patient care — 500 severely ill patients hospitalized countrywide — the mortality rate of Covid-19 patients starts going up.

Leora Horwitz, an NYU medical professor who has been studying Covid-19 mortality and was not involved in the new preprints, noted that there may be other explanations for the rising death risk as hospitals fill up. For example, there could be a potential selection bias that happens in the ICU: If sicker patients are admitted, compared to less strained days, that would also lead to an increase in mortality.

Even so, she said, “hospital strain probably does contribute,” and the implication couldn’t be clearer: Governments need to do everything possible to prevent infections now.

“The idea behind flattening the curve was that even if we have to have the same number of infections — if we can spread them out over time, we can keep our hospitals from being [overwhelmed],” Horwitz said. “Now that we have a vaccine, we can do even better than flattening the curve — we can drop the total number of infections dramatically,” because people can avoid ever getting the disease.

Communities need to drive down infections through social distancing and mask-wearing, while governments rapidly deploy the Covid-19 vaccine.

But around the world, these measures aren’t happening quickly or effectively enough, as Mateen is seeing firsthand in London. He’s supposed to return to part-time work helping treat Covid-19 patients on Friday, but the context is different from his last hospital shifts in the fall. One in 30 people in London are now testing positive for the virus — following the arrival of a new, highly contagious variant in the UK — and the city’s mayor just declared a state of emergency, warning “more people will die” as hospitals become overwhelmed.

Mateen’s doctor friends — who have been “shouldering an enormous burden” for months — are anxiously circulating stories about UK hospitals having to ration oxygen where supplies are running out.

Share All sharing options for: Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new Covid-19 variants, in 2 charts

A more contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is a deadlier one. Not because it gets any individual sicker but because it reaches more people. More illness means more cases: more mild cases, more severe cases, more long-term complications, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.

There’s no one perfect estimate for how much more contagious the SARS-CoV-2 variant called B.1.1.7, which was first discovered in the UK, might be. There needs to be more careful lab work done in animals to nail it down, which could take a few more weeks. But preliminary estimates find it to be between 30 percent and 70 percent more contagious. This variant is now popping up all over the world: in the US, throughout Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere. It’s especially concerning, considering that, in the US and elsewhere, the pandemic’s spread is still reaching new heights.

There’s also a variant called 501Y.V2 that was first found in South Africa; it appears less widespread than B.1.1.7, but also to be more contagious than older variants. It’s still possible that other more transmissible variants will emerge in the future. Scientists just don’t know.

Regardless of exactly how transmissible any new variant is, any possible increase in transmissibility is extremely concerning to epidemiologists and others in public health. It means now, more than ever, our collective and individual actions to stop the spread are critically important.

Here are a few key reasons why.

A more transmissible virus simply means more cases

The reason for concern over a more contagious variant of the virus is simple. “Once it [the variant] becomes common, it will accelerate transmission considerably,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a press call. Accelerated transmission means more cases.

That’s because the virus grows exponentially. Any increase in its inherent transmissibility causes an increasingly high number of cases down the line, if control measures don’t also accelerate to keep up.

With a 50 percent increase in infectiousness, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch says. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” It could be higher, he says.

A more transmissible virus means we need to work harder to stop the spread

Epidemiologists think about the transmissibility of a virus with a figure called R, or the basic reproduction number. This describes how many new cases, on average, will follow one case of the virus.

In the beginning of the outbreak, before the world sprang into action, epidemiologists estimated the R to be around 2 or 3. Since then, thanks to our (inconsistently implemented) efforts — mask-wearing, social distancing, business closures, etc — the R has been reduced in many states to around 1.1 to 1.2. But as long as the R figure is greater than 1, the virus can spread exponentially.

Let’s say a community has gotten its R value down to 1. Then a 50 percent more transmissible variant comes along. It could mean that the same mitigation effort that got the old variant of the virus down to 1 now only gets it down to 1.5.

Which is to say: To combat a more transmissible version of the virus, communities need even more stringent controls.

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Let’s say a community has the virus more or less under control. The R value in the area is 1, which means the number of cases in the area remains constant, month to month.

In this scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, and you’ll have 1,000 cases a month from now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes it takes about five days for one infection to cause another). “Now let’s imagine the virus is 50 percent more transmissible. .... 1,000 cases of such a virus now would translate to more than 10,000 cases a month from now if you did nothing!”

A more transmissible virus increases the number of people who need to be vaccinated

A more transmissible virus also increases the threshold for herd immunity, or the rough estimate of the percentage of people in a population who need to achieve immunity, ideally via a vaccination, in order for the outbreak to decrease in size.

Herd immunity thresholds are dependent on the value of R. The higher the R value, the higher the threshold. If a more transmissible variant becomes dominant the world over, it increases pressure on vaccination campaigns to vaccinate even more people. Already, it’s looking like upward of 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to achieve herd immunity (though the exact figure needed is unknown). That’s already an extremely high and difficult bar to clear, given the slow early distribution of the vaccines.

There’s also the yet-to-be-realized possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that reduces the efficacy of the current vaccines.

A more transmissible virus means more death

One good piece of news about the B.1.1.7 variant: So far, it doesn’t seem to be any deadlier than older variants of the virus. That is: Any individual who gets it isn’t any more likely to end up in the hospital or die, according to the early data.

But more infections mean more death. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Switzerland, says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

A 50 percent more contagious virus is even a deadlier concern than one that’s 50 percent more deadly, as London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains on Twitter.

If a city has an R value of 1.1 and there are 10,000 people infected, in one month’s time, you’d expect to see 129 deaths, he says.

Increase the deadliness of the virus by 50 percent in that scenario and you’d expect 193 deaths — a 49.6 percent increase.

Increase the contagiousness of the virus in this scenario by 50 percent and you get 978 deaths, Kucharski finds. That’s a 658 percent increase. That’s a theoretical calculation, but the central point is the exponential effect, as Kucharski explains.

The above is just an illustrative example, but the key message: an increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity). 5/5 — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) December 28, 2020

It’s not entirely clear if this will come to pass

Again, the estimate of 50 percent increased transmissibility is just an estimate. And even if new variants are more transmissible, it could be hard to predict how much more transmissible it will be in different locations.

Hanage stresses that the 50 percent more transmissible figure being reported is based on how this variant behaves in the UK. In a different place — with different adherences to social distancing, different mitigation measures in place — the new variant could behave differently. It’s complicated, yes, but that’s outbreaks for you.

But even the hypothetical threat of a more transmissible variant is a call for action.

To stop more mutations from happening, to stop more potentially problematic variants from popping up, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, told me in a December interview. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

The new variant mean our individual actions matter more than ever. This variant spreads in the same manner as other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the same precautions apply. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and ventilation are as important as ever.

With the new variant around, Lipsitch says, “Your isolation and quarantine and contact tracing is considerably more important, even more than it was before. So you’re doing more for the world.”",voxdotcom,"['r', 'epidemiologists', 'means', 'thats', 'virus', 'covid19', 'worried', 'charts', 'variant', '50', 'variants', 'transmissible', 'cases', 'number']",0
2021-01-13 01:19:57+00:00,7,"As vaccines began to roll out weeks ago, some hospitals around the country reported that 40 percent or more of their health care workers who could have gotten a Covid-19 vaccine by January had not immediately signed up for it. Other health facilities have had so many extra doses from employees who declined the vaccine that people outside that first priority group — including a sheriff’s deputy and a Disney employee — ended up getting shots.

And a new report by a consortium of universities, released Friday, shows that Covid-19 vaccine uptake and enthusiasm in the health care workforce has also been incredibly uneven. For example, those earning less than $50,000 a year were almost three times less likely to have been vaccinated by mid-January than someone earning more than $200,000 — 8 percent vs 23 percent. Those making lower wages were also much more likely to say they would not get the vaccine at all (27 percent versus 11 percent).

These are troubling developments, especially since health care workers are at higher risk of contracting the virus and are essential in our efforts to treat Covid-19 patients. Some public health experts hoped this group would be relatively easy to vaccinate — and could help pave the way for broader vaccine acceptance. But they also represent a revealing cross-section of America.

A December survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found health care workers overall were about as likely to be hesitant about getting the vaccine as the general population (29 percent and 27 percent, respectively), with these respondents saying they would probably not or definitely not get the vaccine.

And even those who say they plan to get the vaccine might not actually do so right away. Another December survey, of workers in the Yale Medicine and Yale New Haven Health systems, described in a commentary in NEJM Catalyst found that of the 3,500-plus respondents, 85 percent said they would be “extremely likely” or “somewhat likely” to get a Covid-19 vaccine. So far about 68 percent of their workers have gotten the vaccine when it was offered to them (which is, however, a sizable increase from early January, when the rate was 53 percent).

Understanding what’s holding many health care workers back could help us improve vaccine uptake in the wider population. What’s clear is that we will need the vast majority of people in the US to get vaccinated against Covid-19 in order to stop the pandemic.

But we also have to be careful. Using the wrong approach or language to encourage vaccination could backfire, increasing hesitancy overall, says Alison Buttenheim, a faculty member at Penn Nursing and the Perelman School of Medicine, and scientific director for the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics. “If we go about it in the wrong way, we could miss the window and blow it,” she says.

Here’s what we know about vaccine hesitancy among health care workers — and what we can learn from it.

3 big reasons health care workers are putting off the vaccines

In addition to preventing infections, serious illness, and even death, vaccinating health care workers first provides an opportunity to gather a wealth of information we won’t be able to get from the general public. That’s because health care systems have the data not only on how many people were offered and got the vaccine, but also on their demographics.

It’s a diverse group: People working in health systems include not just nurses and doctors, but also those who move patients, work in food service, serve in administrative roles, and keep facilities clean and operational. And the people in these many roles span ages, races and ethnicities, educational attainment, income levels, and many other categories.

“In the United States, it’s our best shot at really understanding vaccine hesitancy and the populations we need to be considering for getting the most vaccine coverage,” says Whitney Robinson, an epidemiologist at the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina.

From early trends, some key lessons about why some health care workers are putting off the vaccine are emerging.

1) Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy may not be the same as other vaccine hesitancy

The experts we spoke with noted that most of the health care workers who are reluctant to get the Covid-19 vaccine immediately are not necessarily refusing it indefinitely. Many nurses, Buttenheim said in early January, “are in a wait-and-see mode: ‘I wouldn’t mind if a few more million people got it before I did.’” Despite robust safety and efficacy data, they want to see more real-world proof first.

That’s a very different stance from people who refuse — or refuse for their children — vaccines that have been around and proven safe for decades. This means “you can’t necessarily just apply what we know about vaccine hesitancy for childhood vaccines and other vaccines,” Robinson says.

As the Yale study found, among those 15 percent of workers who said they were less likely to get a Covid-19 vaccine now, many wanted a year — or at least six months — of follow-up data on recipients. Only about 11 percent of these reluctant people said that nothing would make them comfortable getting it; and fewer than 1 percent of them said they were “anti-vaccine” overall. Still, as Vice reported, health care workers are vulnerable to both believing and disseminating the Covid-19 vaccine misinformation circulating via social media.

“Accounts with names like The Holistic Nurse are proclaiming that they won’t get vaccinated, and strongly implying their followers should do the same,” Vice’s Shayla Love and Anna Merlan write. “It’s a uniquely risky situation, where people claiming medical expertise are working to undermine trust in a vaccine, just as it becomes clear that a majority of the population worldwide will need to get it in order to keep us all safe.”

2) Covid-19 hesitancy among health care workers tends to follow education

The new February report found that, of workers in the health care field who had not received education beyond high school, 29 percent said they would not get the Covid-19 vaccine (and 22 percent said they would wait until most people they knew had been vaccinated) — compared to 9 percent (and 10 percent, respectively) of people who hold a graduate degree.

Similarly, of the 15 percent of adults in the Kaiser survey who said they would “definitely not” get a Covid-19 vaccine, more than half of those (53 percent) had a high school degree or less. On the flip side, those who reported they would get the vaccine “as soon as possible” were most likely to have at least a college degree.

These patterns track with reports from health systems so far. For example, groups getting the vaccine at higher rates also are those most likely to have among the highest education. Brita Roy, of the Yale School of Medicine, where she is also director of population health and co-author of the Yale NEJM Catalyst study, notes that by early January, about 90 percent of medical residents had chosen to get the vaccine right away, compared with about 20 to 25 percent for those working in environmental services, food service, and transportation (who are likely to have lower overall education attainment). These latter groups have since started signing up for the vaccine in larger numbers, with 45 percent of people in environmental services choosing to get the shot and 35 percent of those in food service. But a striking gap between uptake with those in higher-credentialed jobs remains.

3) There are historical reasons for health care workers of color to be skeptical about getting an early health intervention

About 40 percent of health care workers in the US are people of color. A deep history of institutionalized medical racism means that people of color have frequently been subjects of unethical experiments in the US, often sowing justified mistrust in the medical establishment. Unfortunately, due also to centuries of systemic racism, many of these groups have also been among those hardest hit by the pandemic.

“I want these populations that have been burdened so badly with Covid-19 to be prioritized” for the vaccine, Robinson says. But, she acknowledges that even that ethos could make people suspect. “That’s so unusual with how health care usually operates in the United States, people might have pause,” she says.

And while some workers who haven’t gotten a vaccine yet might be prompted to sign up through simple reminders or other behavioral nudges, overcoming mistrust due to systemic racism, “this is not a nudgeable problem,” Buttenheim says. “That set of concerns and history isn’t going to be solved by a ‘mythbusters’ fact sheet or another study. It’s about really frank conversations about what you need to feel comfortable about this vaccine.”

Another step in addressing this, she says, would also be for health and medical institutions to clearly communicate and own up to past wrongdoings and indicate their goals for equitable medical treatment now and in the future.

How to address vaccine hesitancy

The rate at which health care workers are declining or delaying Covid-19 vaccines is, to many experts, unfortunately not a surprise. “I’m on record banging my head against the wall for several months that we need to be prepared for this, to have a vaccine acceptance strategy,” says Saad Omer, an infectious disease professor at the Yale School of Medicine and director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.

Although some were optimistic that health care workers would have a particularly high uptake of the vaccine, Robinson was also skeptical. “Everybody saw this coming who works in this field,” she says. “This is one of my frustrations: We know things that we haven’t been acting on.”

And there is a vast amount of research on the best ways to help people feel more comfortable getting a vaccine in general, which we can borrow from to some extent for the new Covid-19 vaccines.

For starters, we know what not to do when approaching people who are reluctant to get a vaccine. “‘You’re wrong’ — that doesn’t tend to work,” Robinson notes. “It’s a delicate thing.” She has found that among the most effective techniques is understanding where people are coming from and what their hesitations are. Acknowledging the vaccines’ newness will likely be important in addressing people’s concerns — both in this first priority group and likely later ones, as well.

Also, giving people incentives — financial or otherwise — can actually discourage them from getting vaccinated, especially if they already have concerns about side effects.

Many health systems are already working hard to ramp up communications strategies with workers, provide peer-to-peer discussion opportunities, and even talking to their employees outside of work.

“Health care workers are also community members, so reaching them through social media and our local media outlets, as well as internal communications, has been key,” Mike Dacey, president and chief operations officer at Riverside Health System in Virginia (where they have now had about 66 percent uptake among workers), wrote to Vox in an email. “We are encouraging team members who are eligible to receive the vaccine to do so within their designated phase to best support the safety and health of our team and community.”

In a December JAMA op-ed, Buttenheim and her co-authors also suggested five behavior-based strategies for getting more people to get the Covid-19 vaccine:

Have community and public leaders endorse the vaccine

Frame vaccination as a “public act” that benefits others; maybe even hand out stickers

Make getting the vaccine free and easy

Give people early access to the vaccine — if they sign up early

Eventually make vaccination a requirement for entry, such as to schools, workplaces, and even restaurants, gyms, or airplanes

Other experts note that being transparent about any potential side effects, small and large, will help engender trust. For example, some people balked at a January 6 report from the CDC that noted several severe allergic reactions — anaphylaxis — following Covid-19 vaccinations, at a rate of about 11 per 1 million doses or about 0.001 percent of people who get the vaccine, and haven’t caused any deaths (unlike the virus itself). But these events would have been unlikely to surface in the trials of tens of thousands of people, which is why the government keeps careful record of all vaccines after they go to market.

Lesser side effects are also important to communicate clearly to improve trust and transparency now and in the future. “Planning to survey the population on mild side effects experience and share those data with our health care workers will also be useful for the community and [larger] population,” Brita Roy wrote to Vox in an email.

“The sooner we can get more people vaccinated, the sooner we can get back to some semblance of normal,” Buttenheim says. And we have to get a whole lot of people vaccinated. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci (after revising his public immunity estimations upward) says we’ll need 70 to 90 percent of people immune to the virus to squelch the pandemic.

For health care workers who refuse their first chance at a vaccine, getting back in line could be tricky. There’s no guarantee of when people will be able to get a vaccine if they wait past their designated phase — until more doses are available to the general public. And even more immediately, some states, including Connecticut, have been resupplying facilities based on the number of doses they were able to give the week before. So if uptake is chronically low, availability could dip, too.

That many health care workers are not refusing the vaccine outright and, instead, planning to wait and see provides some small glimmer of hope. Acceptance of the vaccine “is likely to grow as the social norm is established,” Omer says, with the result of more people getting it when they can.

For now, many advocate using the science and information we already have to meet people where they are, and help them feel comfortable getting the shot. “We just need to get ahead of it,” Robinson says. “So much of the response has been reactionary when it comes to Covid-19. I just hope we can break that cycle.”

At least three Democratic members of the House of Representatives recently found out the hard way. They were sheltering for hours with Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks during the Capitol riots on January 6 and later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Their experience suggests that one dose of a vaccine and masks may not be enough to protect someone in the face of hours of reckless behavior.

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) reported on January 11 that she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and began experiencing symptoms, though she’d already received one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 29. Watson Coleman, who’s 75 and a cancer survivor, said she may have been exposed at the US Capitol during the riots as she sheltered with other representatives who refused to wear face masks.

“[S]he is always masked and that included the time she spent in the Capitol in lockdown,” said a spokesperson for Watson Coleman in an email.

Another Congress member who was in the same lockdown area on Wednesday with maskless colleagues, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), announced Monday night she’d also tested positive. The Cut reports she received the vaccine on January 4.

On Tuesday, a third Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, who was also vaccinated on January 4, said he tested positive for the virus but was not experiencing any symptoms.

Unfortunately, I received a positive COVID-19 test this morning following being tested yesterday on the advice of the House Attending Physician. — Rep. Brad Schneider (@RepSchneider) January 12, 2021

“Today, I am now in strict isolation, worried that I have risked my wife’s health and angry at the selfishness and arrogance of the anti-maskers who put their own contempt and disregard for decency ahead of the health and safety of their colleagues and our staff,” he added on Twitter.

The vaccines for Covid-19 that have been approved to date are highly effective, but the new cluster in Congress is a reminder that they’re not perfect, especially not at one dose.

Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are reported to be around 95 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 illness after two doses, but that means that a tiny fraction of people who were vaccinated could still get sick.

And since the two doses of both vaccines are supposed to be administered 28 and 21 days apart, respectively, it is possible for people to be infected between their shots as well. While the first dose of the vaccine does offer some protection, that protection takes days or weeks to build up, and it’s not as complete as the shield provided by two doses.

Testing positive for the virus does not necessarily mean that an individual will experience the disease and show symptoms. But it might mean that they can still transmit the virus to others.

The possibility of getting infected even after beginning an inoculation regimen was evident during clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines.

In Pfizer and BioNTech’s application for an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, they reported 178 Covid-19 cases among participants in their phase 3 clinical trial, with nine cases in the group that received the vaccine. The majority of those nine cases were between the first and second doses.

Moderna’s phase 3 trial showed a similar pattern, with 185 Covid-19 cases in the placebo group and 11 cases in the group that received the vaccine, most within two weeks of the first dose.

For both vaccines, it may also be the case that some of the people who reported Covid-19 symptoms were infected before they received their first vaccine dose. In rare cases, people may fall ill even after two doses, but the evidence points to a less severe course of the disease among the immunized.

It’s important to note (since there’s a lot of misinformation circulating on social media) that the vaccines themselves cannot cause infection. Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine don’t contain any part of SARS-CoV-2. Instead, they use a strand of genetic material called mRNA that instructs the body to make a fragment of the virus.

There’s still more to learn about the protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines

One lingering concern about Covid-19 vaccines is that protection might not last forever. Since Covid-19 is still a fairly new disease and there’s only a few months of data on people who’ve received the vaccine, scientists are still trying to figure out how quickly immunity might wane. Based on experiences with past coronaviruses, scientists expect protection might last a few years, but that’s something that can only be verified with the passage of time.

Another important question is whether someone can spread Covid-19 to others after getting partially or fully vaccinated. Some early evidence from Moderna showed that its Covid-19 vaccine does block some transmission, but it might not be to the same degree that it prevents illness.

Determining this will take time, especially since many SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic and require testing to confirm. Researchers have reported recently that up to half of infections are caused by people who get infected but don’t show symptoms themselves, so it’s important to figure out how much asymptomatic transmission can still occur among the immunized.

If a vaccine does block transmission well, it means that it can provide a faster route to herd immunity. But since there are currently so many unknowns, people who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 should still follow all the regular Covid-19 precautions, like hand-washing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, especially when community transmission is as high as it is now. Vaccines are critical, but they are just one line of defense against Covid-19, and as the recent infections of members of Congress show, preventing transmission requires others to take precautions as well.",voxdotcom,"['dose', 'outbreak', 'received', 'transmission', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'protection', 'coronavirus', 'positive', 'fully', 'shows', 'capitol', 'cases', 'shield', 'vaccines']",0

Share All sharing options for: Once you and your friends are vaccinated, can you travel and quit social distancing?

Editor’s note, March 9: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 8 issued new guidelines for fully vaccinated people. Read about the new guidelines here, and for Vox’s latest coverage of vaccine efforts in the US and worldwide, see our storystream.

Now that the vaccines are arriving, people are starting to dream.

They say things like, “The second everyone in my family is vaccinated, we’re going on a big trip to Asia!” or “As soon as my five closest friends and I get the shot, I’m spending a weekend at a cabin with them. No masks, no social distancing.”

While many of us are thinking about the Covid-19 pandemic in binary terms — there’s “life before I get the shot” and “life after I get the shot” — experts are cautioning us to think more gradually. Not everything will change the second that syringe enters your arm.

“Realistically, it’s definitely not going to be an on/off switch on normal,” said Eleanor Murray, a Boston University epidemiologist.

The best way to set realistic expectations around what life will look like in 2021 is to think of it in three stages. Stage 1 is what you can safely do once you and your close friends or family are vaccinated. Stage 2 is what you can safely do once your city or state has reached herd immunity, where enough people are protected against infection that the virus can’t easily spark new outbreaks. Stage 3 is what you can do once herd immunity is reached internationally. (Note that there’s a good chance we won’t reach that last stage in 2021.)

A lot will depend on the answer to a crucial open question: Are the vaccines only good at preventing symptomatic disease, or are they also good at preventing infection and transmission?

“One can imagine a scenario where you are vaccinated and you develop a protective immune response. You will not get sick, you will not die, but the virus will still be able to grow in your nose and transmit to other people,” said Barry Bloom, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard.

Bloom and other experts are optimistic that the vaccines help reduce infection and transmission, but nobody knows by how much. “We just need more data on transmission,” he said. “Hopefully it will come out of the trials in a couple of months.”

In the meantime, even vaccinated people have to assume they can still become infected and pass along the virus. That means they need to keep wearing masks and social distancing whenever they’re around unvaccinated people.

But as more and more people get vaccinated, the question will arise: What about when you’re among people who’ve all been vaccinated? That brings us to stage 1.

Stage 1: You and your close friends or family are vaccinated

Let’s say you and your five closest friends have been vaccinated. Can you all rent a cabin in the woods and spend a weekend together, without masks or social distancing?

The answer is: It’s likely to be fine — with some caveats.

For one thing, vaccines don’t work instantly. “You need to wait at minimum two weeks after the first shot to see any kind of protection, but really you need to wait at least a week after the second shot,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University.

Then there’s the fact that the vaccine may not work equally well in everyone. Some people may have health issues that keep their bodies from mounting quite as successful an immune response. “The fact is, I’m not absolutely sure that everybody who receives the vaccine develops a protective response,” Bloom said.

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines showed 95 percent efficacy at preventing symptomatic disease in trials after two doses. But they’re not 100 percent. There’s still a chance you could pick up the virus from one of your vaccinated friends and develop symptoms. Although the vaccines are very good at preventing the severe symptoms that land people in the hospital, experts can’t rule out the possibility that you’ll develop milder symptoms, which could conceivably turn chronic or “long-haul.”

So the weekend getaway will not be completely safe. But, Rasmussen said, “if your entire group of friends have all gotten the full vaccine regimen and at least a week has passed since their second shot, it probably is okay for you to get together with them in a closed setting, where you’re not interacting with the public. So maybe a vacation where you all get an Airbnb and hang out — but without going bar-hopping! — would be okay.”

Murray agreed the risk would be relatively low, provided you and your friends have no underlying conditions and don’t live with vulnerable unvaccinated people whom you want to protect from infection. “But when you come back and go to the grocery store,” she said, “I’d expect that you’re still wearing masks.”

That’s because there’s a big difference between being in a closed bubble, where you know that everyone is vaccinated, and being in the public domain, where you risk infecting unvaccinated people.

Asked if she would go on the cabin weekend trip, Murray said, “I would probably be comfortable,” but that’s because she doesn’t live near any unvaccinated parents or grandparents whom she needs to keep safe, and because she expects to be in the last group of people to get the vaccine — by which point herd immunity will have built up more, driving down the chances that any of her friends would show up at the cabin unwittingly infected.

Stage 2: Your city or state has reached herd immunity

In public settings, Americans should continue with masking and social distancing until 75 to 85 percent of the population is vaccinated, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He estimates that around that stage — which could come in mid-fall — the US will reach herd immunity. (This is just an estimate, though, and it’s liable to change depending on Covid-19 variants, vaccine uptake rates, and other factors.)

Rather than achieving national immunity all at once, we’re likely to see regions within the US passing the immunity threshold at different times. As each city or state announces that it’s past the threshold, it’ll probably start rolling back requirements gradually. We might see restaurants open up for indoor dining, but with servers continuing to wear masks.

“I think probably masks will be one of the last things to roll back,” Murray said, “because masks don’t have a commercial cost to them. They’re something that’s helpful and doesn’t necessarily cost the economy anything.” Given that there’s a lot of travel between jurisdictions, masks may not be rolled back until the whole country reaches herd immunity.

Once a jurisdiction reaches immunity, people there will be able to safely return to venues like schools, movie theaters, and indoor dining at restaurants (though of course state and local governments have been making these decisions all throughout the pandemic, weighing the indispensability and risks of different venues). The idea is that if, say, 80 percent of people are vaccinated, that creates an “umbrella” of immunity, as Fauci put it, that “would be able to protect even the vulnerables who have not been vaccinated, or those in which the vaccine has not been effective.”

Rasmussen emphasized that if we want to feel not just 95 percent but more like 99 percent safe in public spaces, we need as many people as possible to get vaccinated, because that’s what stops community transmission.

“You can have a lot of great vaccines, but they don’t completely eradicate these viruses unless they’re taken up very, very widely,” she said. “But people are still not thinking about vaccines as a population-level intervention. They’re thinking about them as an individual intervention. It’s very exemplary of this pandemic.”

From the beginning, health experts have tried to get the public to understand that when it comes to the coronavirus, nobody is truly safe until everybody is safe.

Stage 2, for that reason, is not the time for international travel to countries that have not yet achieved herd immunity or that have little health care infrastructure.

If a large region in your country passes the immunity threshold, domestic travel — say, to see vaccinated family members a couple of states over — may be fine. But for your safety and for the sake of people abroad, it’s best to hold off on big international trips.

Stage 3: Herd immunity is reached internationally

Let’s manage expectations right off the bat. There’s a good chance we won’t reach this stage until 2022 or later. That’s because access to the vaccines is far from equal around the world.

“What we’re seeing is the US, Canada, and Europe are getting pretty good access to the vaccine, but if you’re hoping to go to Mozambique or something, a lot of those other countries are not necessarily able to purchase the vaccine and it’ll be a lot longer for those countries,” Murray said.

That’s why it’s so important to have groups like the Covax Facility, a unique financing mechanism that has gotten 190 countries (92 of which are lower-income countries) to pool their resources to end the pandemic faster. It aims to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year to participating countries, regardless of their ability to pay.

How long it takes for various countries to reach herd immunity will depend in part on how fast they can access vaccines and what share of their populations are willing to get the shot. But as mentioned above, there’s another crucial factor.

“It’s really going to come down to what we learn over the next few months about how well the vaccine prevents infection and transmission,” Murray said, adding that she doesn’t expect we’ll have an answer to that until March at the earliest.

If it turns out that the vaccines prevent infection and transmission almost as well as they prevent symptomatic disease, we may see some countries opening their borders to tourists who provide proof of vaccination, in an effort to get the tourism sector and the broader economy going again.

“If we do find that it prevents 95 percent of infections, then I’d say yeah, if you and all your friends are vaccinated, plan that Fiji vacation, go wild, spend your tourism dollars helping economies of places that can’t yet afford the vaccine!” Murray said. “But if it turns out that no … then it would be really inappropriate to be going somewhere where they can’t afford the vaccine and still spreading disease.”

In that scenario, we may have to wait until 2022 or later for travel to some countries to resume.

For now, remember that keeping up with the measures we know curb the spread of the virus — like masking and social distancing — is the best way to ensure we can all get back to normal faster. Yes, we are all sick of them. But the more we stick to them over the next few months, the sooner we can abandon them for good.

2021-01-12 15:10:08+00:00,5,"With supply of the two authorized vaccines for Covid-19 still limited, there’s been a lot of chatter around how exactly to distribute the initial doses in the US. But the prospect of vaccinating one group in particular has proven to be especially vexing for scientists and health officials: people participating in phase 3 clinical trials for these vaccines.

The ongoing phase 3 trial for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine includes 44,000 people, and 22,000 received the placebo. For the Moderna vaccine trial, half of the 30,000 participants got it.

These trials demonstrated that both of these vaccines are highly effective at preventing Covid-19. But to get those results, hundreds of people had to get sick, some of them severely ill, and the vast majority of those people received a placebo. And that reality is especially tricky as the trials continue while the vaccines are being distributed to high-priority groups of the general public.

That’s why some vaccine researchers have called for all people in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech trials not just to eventually receive a Covid-19 inoculation but to move to the front of the line right away.

“I think the most important [reason] is that these men and women volunteered and have been instrumental and critical in helping us develop these vaccines,” said Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, during a press conference in December. “They should be rewarded for it rather than, in a way, punished for it by, for instance, being delayed in receiving the vaccine.”

The trial participants themselves have also been agitating to receive the vaccines.

@pfizer @AlbertBourla @aroseyone @US_FDA @FDAMedia I live across the street from my trial site and they said they have my vaccine ready, but you are prohibiting them from giving it to your placebo group until mid-February. Let them vaccinate us. You are allowing us to get sick! https://t.co/raL8qCNViF — Michael Tovar (@MichaelXTovar) January 11, 2021

In December, Moderna announced that it would offer placebo recipients the option of getting the vaccine. Earlier this month, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they would offer their vaccine to any trial participant who wanted it on March 1. In both cases, the decision is left to the individual participant.

Other scientists, however, are concerned that losing the placebo group in these trials squanders a critical opportunity to learn about things such as the rate of long-term complications, how long protection against the disease lasts, and how well the vaccines keep people from spreading it even if they don’t get sick themselves.

At the same time, participants in the trials can drop out at any point. Presented with the threat of a raging pandemic and multiple vaccines being administered, some may choose to do so, leaving researchers with an even smaller pool of subjects.

That’s why regulators, scientists, and vaccine companies spent so much energy debating ways to learn as much as they can from clinical trials before they potentially crumble.

There’s a lot left to learn about Covid-19 vaccines, and placebo-controlled trials are a great way to get answers

To figure out if a vaccine works in the real world, researchers have to test it in tens of thousands of volunteers in trials that can last for years. Roughly half of the volunteers get the actual vaccine while the other half get a placebo, and neither group knows what they received.

Scientists then observe the two groups to see how many people get sick. A substantially larger number of Covid-19 cases in the placebo group indicates that the vaccine is highly effective at preventing disease.

In preliminary results, the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine both showed that they can prevent about 95 percent of recipients from getting Covid-19. It took fewer than 200 Covid-19 cases in either trial to determine this.

This rapid discovery was enabled by having so many people in the trials. “[W]e need large numbers of participants to observe relatively few events, and this is exactly why trials number in the thousands,” said Natalie Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, in an email last year.

But these initial numbers only reveal overall efficacy for the whole trial. Within the trial, it’s likely that vaccines offer varying levels of protection and risk within different demographics, like in older adults or in people with preexisting health conditions.

When split into these groups, the differences between the placebo group and the vaccine group isn’t as stark. In the Pfizer/BioNTech trial, there were just 15 Covid-19 cases detected in people between the ages of 65 and 74, with 14 cases in the placebo group. For people 75 and older, just five cases were reported, all in the placebo group. These results are promising, but not as robust as the efficacy results for the trial as a whole.

Letting the trial run longer and allowing more cases to accumulate would clarify the level of protection offered by the vaccine in different groups. That information can then be used to better target doses where they’ll be more effective or compare vaccines against one another to select the most effective one for particular populations. This information would be especially useful as more vaccines gain approval.

Having a large number of participants in clinical trials helps answer some other critical questions about the vaccines, like the chances of rare complications.

There’s also a time element to consider. The emergency use authorizations were granted based on two months of safety results. While complications relating to vaccines often arise shortly after the shots are administered, there could be other issues that arise months or years later.

Another crucial factor is how long immunity from the vaccine lasts, which can only be determined by monitoring recipients of the vaccine — and ideally also of the placebo — over a much longer period.

There are also some important vaccine questions that are beyond the scope of these studies. For instance: Can you spread Covid-19 even if you get the vaccine? Many SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, and finding those asymptomatic spreaders would require testing participants on a regular basis, a tedious and time-consuming endeavor, but one that would reveal a critical variable for the pandemic. If it turns out that a vaccine can block transmission about as well as it blocks disease, that would make it easier to achieve herd immunity. It would also help families and communities resume close contact more quickly.

Answers to these questions are all the more urgent now that there are new variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating that are seemingly more transmissible and that contain mutations that may weaken the protection offered by the Covid-19 vaccines that are currently available.

The structure of a double-blind clinical trial, where neither the participants nor the experimenters know right away who received the vaccine, is also important for gathering good data. It helps ensure that participants don’t change their behavior based on what they received.

“If we unblinded today, vaccine recipients probably would engage in riskier activity immediately,” said Steven Goodman, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the Stanford University School of Medicine. “I mean, why not?”

Someone who knew they were vaccinated might end up engaging in riskier behavior, or someone who knows they received a placebo may take additional precautions. Both types of behavior skew the results and make it harder to draw a direct comparison between the arms of a trial.

Taken together, these factors mean that the longer a placebo-controlled trial remains intact, the more information we will be able to gather on how best to deploy the vaccines and ultimately illuminate a path to the end of the pandemic.

How Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are proposing to get Covid-19 vaccines to the placebo groups in their clinical trials

Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna have all agreed to monitor their remaining pool of phase 3 clinical trial participants for at least two years. Both companies also say they are ethically obligated to let participants know that they may be eligible to get vaccinated outside of the trial.

But they have very different ideas for how to handle their placebo groups from here on out. During a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, officials at Moderna proposed offering everyone in the placebo group the vaccine. This would unblind the trial and effectively end the placebo control, although the company plans to continue monitoring participants. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.

Pfizer, meanwhile, proposed what it calls a Vaccine Transition Option that would only unblind participants who would be eligible to receive the vaccine outside of the trial if they weren’t enrolled. Right now, that would mean mainly older participants and front-line health workers in the placebo group would have the option of getting vaccinated. As more vaccines become available to the general public, more people in the placebo group would have the option of getting their shots. And then by March, they would offer the vaccine to anyone in the placebo group.

“Participants should not have to choose between remaining in the study or receiving the investigational vaccine if it is available to them in their community,” wrote a spokesperson for Pfizer in an email. “Please note that this move from the placebo group to the vaccine group is completely optional, and participants are encouraged to remain blinded throughout the full study duration.”

But some are skeptical the company could pull it off. “The Pfizer approach, which I think is intellectually a very elegant and appropriate one, practically is a very difficult one,” said Operation Warp Speed’s Slaoui. He noted that every state has its own eligibility guidelines for vaccines, so it would be hard to keep tabs on 22,000 people in the company’s placebo group in sites across the country and determine who gets what and when. He noted that there are vaccine doses allocated for clinical trial participants independently of the shots meant for the general public, so vaccinating the placebo group would not come at the expense of anyone else.

All the while, more participants will continue dropping out of the trials as they try to get vaccines on their own. Already, 95 participants have dropped out of the placebo group in the Pfizer/BioNTech phase 2 trial. And once someone leaves the trial, researchers will no longer be able to gather data about their experiences.

There is another approach that could help maintain the placebo group for longer

Stanford’s Goodman suggested another strategy known as a blinded crossover. The idea is to get everyone in the trial vaccinated without revealing who is in which group.

To do this, trial administrators would essentially have to administer a second set of shots to anyone in the trial who wants to become unblinded. The people who received the vaccine at the outset would get a placebo, and the people who received a placebo would get the actual vaccine.

Though every participant would then be assured that they are immunized, none could be sure when they were actually immune until two weeks after the second shot, so any subsequent changes in behavior would likely be similar across both the placebo group and the vaccine group.

The challenge for that approach is going to be getting all 30,000 to 44,000 participants back into the clinic to receive another round of injections. “That would require more infrastructure, for sure, but it would expand that period of valid comparison in the clinical trial,” Goodman said. There’s also a chance that some participants might leave the trial anyway once they know for sure they’ve been immunized.

The window for effective clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines is closing

There is an even bigger problem looming for other placebo-controlled trials for Covid-19 vaccines: It’s going to get much harder to recruit participants from here on out. Why would you enroll in a trial where you have a 50-50 shot of being protected from the disease if you can now get in line for an actual vaccine?

The companies like Johnson & Johnson and Novavax running trials on other Covid-19 vaccines may be faced with the prospect of losing participants or having to vaccinate everyone in the trial — some immediately and some deferred — to have at least a brief placebo comparison group. They may also have to consider conducting trials in places or with populations where no Covid-19 vaccine is available yet.

“These two [Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech] trials may be among the last placebo-controlled trials we’re going to see,” Goodman said.

The question of how to handle the placebo group is emblematic of the tension recurring throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. With hospitals filling up and thousands dying every day, when is “good enough” good enough?

The scientific questions are indeed important, but balanced against a rising human toll, there is immense pressure to move ahead with incomplete results. This has led to situations like the FDA’s EUAs for questionable Covid-19 treatments like hydroxychloroquine, which it subsequently revoked. At the same time, the longer regulators wait to approve a drug or vaccine, the more people will die.

There is no clear right answer here for placebo groups in clinical trials, but every trial has to make a deliberate decision about how to vaccinate them. Otherwise, researchers will resign themselves to the worst possible outcome, with trial participants haphazardly dropping out and those who stay remaining defenseless against a deadly disease, all while the trials yield less robust data.",voxdotcom,"['explained', 'participants', 'group', 'debate', 'moderna', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'trials', 'trial', 'placebo', 'ending', 'clinical', 'vaccines']",0
2021-01-11 22:40:16+00:00,22,"As vaccines began to roll out weeks ago, some hospitals around the country reported that 40 percent or more of their health care workers who could have gotten a Covid-19 vaccine by January had not immediately signed up for it. Other health facilities have had so many extra doses from employees who declined the vaccine that people outside that first priority group — including a sheriff’s deputy and a Disney employee — ended up getting shots.

And a new report by a consortium of universities, released Friday, shows that Covid-19 vaccine uptake and enthusiasm in the health care workforce has also been incredibly uneven. For example, those earning less than $50,000 a year were almost three times less likely to have been vaccinated by mid-January than someone earning more than $200,000 — 8 percent vs 23 percent. Those making lower wages were also much more likely to say they would not get the vaccine at all (27 percent versus 11 percent).

These are troubling developments, especially since health care workers are at higher risk of contracting the virus and are essential in our efforts to treat Covid-19 patients. Some public health experts hoped this group would be relatively easy to vaccinate — and could help pave the way for broader vaccine acceptance. But they also represent a revealing cross-section of America.

A December survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found health care workers overall were about as likely to be hesitant about getting the vaccine as the general population (29 percent and 27 percent, respectively), with these respondents saying they would probably not or definitely not get the vaccine.

And even those who say they plan to get the vaccine might not actually do so right away. Another December survey, of workers in the Yale Medicine and Yale New Haven Health systems, described in a commentary in NEJM Catalyst found that of the 3,500-plus respondents, 85 percent said they would be “extremely likely” or “somewhat likely” to get a Covid-19 vaccine. So far about 68 percent of their workers have gotten the vaccine when it was offered to them (which is, however, a sizable increase from early January, when the rate was 53 percent).

Understanding what’s holding many health care workers back could help us improve vaccine uptake in the wider population. What’s clear is that we will need the vast majority of people in the US to get vaccinated against Covid-19 in order to stop the pandemic.

But we also have to be careful. Using the wrong approach or language to encourage vaccination could backfire, increasing hesitancy overall, says Alison Buttenheim, a faculty member at Penn Nursing and the Perelman School of Medicine, and scientific director for the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics. “If we go about it in the wrong way, we could miss the window and blow it,” she says.

Here’s what we know about vaccine hesitancy among health care workers — and what we can learn from it.

3 big reasons health care workers are putting off the vaccines

In addition to preventing infections, serious illness, and even death, vaccinating health care workers first provides an opportunity to gather a wealth of information we won’t be able to get from the general public. That’s because health care systems have the data not only on how many people were offered and got the vaccine, but also on their demographics.

It’s a diverse group: People working in health systems include not just nurses and doctors, but also those who move patients, work in food service, serve in administrative roles, and keep facilities clean and operational. And the people in these many roles span ages, races and ethnicities, educational attainment, income levels, and many other categories.

“In the United States, it’s our best shot at really understanding vaccine hesitancy and the populations we need to be considering for getting the most vaccine coverage,” says Whitney Robinson, an epidemiologist at the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina.

From early trends, some key lessons about why some health care workers are putting off the vaccine are emerging.

1) Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy may not be the same as other vaccine hesitancy

The experts we spoke with noted that most of the health care workers who are reluctant to get the Covid-19 vaccine immediately are not necessarily refusing it indefinitely. Many nurses, Buttenheim said in early January, “are in a wait-and-see mode: ‘I wouldn’t mind if a few more million people got it before I did.’” Despite robust safety and efficacy data, they want to see more real-world proof first.

That’s a very different stance from people who refuse — or refuse for their children — vaccines that have been around and proven safe for decades. This means “you can’t necessarily just apply what we know about vaccine hesitancy for childhood vaccines and other vaccines,” Robinson says.

As the Yale study found, among those 15 percent of workers who said they were less likely to get a Covid-19 vaccine now, many wanted a year — or at least six months — of follow-up data on recipients. Only about 11 percent of these reluctant people said that nothing would make them comfortable getting it; and fewer than 1 percent of them said they were “anti-vaccine” overall. Still, as Vice reported, health care workers are vulnerable to both believing and disseminating the Covid-19 vaccine misinformation circulating via social media.

“Accounts with names like The Holistic Nurse are proclaiming that they won’t get vaccinated, and strongly implying their followers should do the same,” Vice’s Shayla Love and Anna Merlan write. “It’s a uniquely risky situation, where people claiming medical expertise are working to undermine trust in a vaccine, just as it becomes clear that a majority of the population worldwide will need to get it in order to keep us all safe.”

2) Covid-19 hesitancy among health care workers tends to follow education

The new February report found that, of workers in the health care field who had not received education beyond high school, 29 percent said they would not get the Covid-19 vaccine (and 22 percent said they would wait until most people they knew had been vaccinated) — compared to 9 percent (and 10 percent, respectively) of people who hold a graduate degree.

Similarly, of the 15 percent of adults in the Kaiser survey who said they would “definitely not” get a Covid-19 vaccine, more than half of those (53 percent) had a high school degree or less. On the flip side, those who reported they would get the vaccine “as soon as possible” were most likely to have at least a college degree.

These patterns track with reports from health systems so far. For example, groups getting the vaccine at higher rates also are those most likely to have among the highest education. Brita Roy, of the Yale School of Medicine, where she is also director of population health and co-author of the Yale NEJM Catalyst study, notes that by early January, about 90 percent of medical residents had chosen to get the vaccine right away, compared with about 20 to 25 percent for those working in environmental services, food service, and transportation (who are likely to have lower overall education attainment). These latter groups have since started signing up for the vaccine in larger numbers, with 45 percent of people in environmental services choosing to get the shot and 35 percent of those in food service. But a striking gap between uptake with those in higher-credentialed jobs remains.

3) There are historical reasons for health care workers of color to be skeptical about getting an early health intervention

About 40 percent of health care workers in the US are people of color. A deep history of institutionalized medical racism means that people of color have frequently been subjects of unethical experiments in the US, often sowing justified mistrust in the medical establishment. Unfortunately, due also to centuries of systemic racism, many of these groups have also been among those hardest hit by the pandemic.

“I want these populations that have been burdened so badly with Covid-19 to be prioritized” for the vaccine, Robinson says. But, she acknowledges that even that ethos could make people suspect. “That’s so unusual with how health care usually operates in the United States, people might have pause,” she says.

And while some workers who haven’t gotten a vaccine yet might be prompted to sign up through simple reminders or other behavioral nudges, overcoming mistrust due to systemic racism, “this is not a nudgeable problem,” Buttenheim says. “That set of concerns and history isn’t going to be solved by a ‘mythbusters’ fact sheet or another study. It’s about really frank conversations about what you need to feel comfortable about this vaccine.”

Another step in addressing this, she says, would also be for health and medical institutions to clearly communicate and own up to past wrongdoings and indicate their goals for equitable medical treatment now and in the future.

How to address vaccine hesitancy

The rate at which health care workers are declining or delaying Covid-19 vaccines is, to many experts, unfortunately not a surprise. “I’m on record banging my head against the wall for several months that we need to be prepared for this, to have a vaccine acceptance strategy,” says Saad Omer, an infectious disease professor at the Yale School of Medicine and director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.

Although some were optimistic that health care workers would have a particularly high uptake of the vaccine, Robinson was also skeptical. “Everybody saw this coming who works in this field,” she says. “This is one of my frustrations: We know things that we haven’t been acting on.”

And there is a vast amount of research on the best ways to help people feel more comfortable getting a vaccine in general, which we can borrow from to some extent for the new Covid-19 vaccines.

For starters, we know what not to do when approaching people who are reluctant to get a vaccine. “‘You’re wrong’ — that doesn’t tend to work,” Robinson notes. “It’s a delicate thing.” She has found that among the most effective techniques is understanding where people are coming from and what their hesitations are. Acknowledging the vaccines’ newness will likely be important in addressing people’s concerns — both in this first priority group and likely later ones, as well.

Also, giving people incentives — financial or otherwise — can actually discourage them from getting vaccinated, especially if they already have concerns about side effects.

Many health systems are already working hard to ramp up communications strategies with workers, provide peer-to-peer discussion opportunities, and even talking to their employees outside of work.

“Health care workers are also community members, so reaching them through social media and our local media outlets, as well as internal communications, has been key,” Mike Dacey, president and chief operations officer at Riverside Health System in Virginia (where they have now had about 66 percent uptake among workers), wrote to Vox in an email. “We are encouraging team members who are eligible to receive the vaccine to do so within their designated phase to best support the safety and health of our team and community.”

In a December JAMA op-ed, Buttenheim and her co-authors also suggested five behavior-based strategies for getting more people to get the Covid-19 vaccine:

Have community and public leaders endorse the vaccine

Frame vaccination as a “public act” that benefits others; maybe even hand out stickers

Make getting the vaccine free and easy

Give people early access to the vaccine — if they sign up early

Eventually make vaccination a requirement for entry, such as to schools, workplaces, and even restaurants, gyms, or airplanes

Other experts note that being transparent about any potential side effects, small and large, will help engender trust. For example, some people balked at a January 6 report from the CDC that noted several severe allergic reactions — anaphylaxis — following Covid-19 vaccinations, at a rate of about 11 per 1 million doses or about 0.001 percent of people who get the vaccine, and haven’t caused any deaths (unlike the virus itself). But these events would have been unlikely to surface in the trials of tens of thousands of people, which is why the government keeps careful record of all vaccines after they go to market.

Lesser side effects are also important to communicate clearly to improve trust and transparency now and in the future. “Planning to survey the population on mild side effects experience and share those data with our health care workers will also be useful for the community and [larger] population,” Brita Roy wrote to Vox in an email.

“The sooner we can get more people vaccinated, the sooner we can get back to some semblance of normal,” Buttenheim says. And we have to get a whole lot of people vaccinated. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci (after revising his public immunity estimations upward) says we’ll need 70 to 90 percent of people immune to the virus to squelch the pandemic.

For health care workers who refuse their first chance at a vaccine, getting back in line could be tricky. There’s no guarantee of when people will be able to get a vaccine if they wait past their designated phase — until more doses are available to the general public. And even more immediately, some states, including Connecticut, have been resupplying facilities based on the number of doses they were able to give the week before. So if uptake is chronically low, availability could dip, too.

That many health care workers are not refusing the vaccine outright and, instead, planning to wait and see provides some small glimmer of hope. Acceptance of the vaccine “is likely to grow as the social norm is established,” Omer says, with the result of more people getting it when they can.

For now, many advocate using the science and information we already have to meet people where they are, and help them feel comfortable getting the shot. “We just need to get ahead of it,” Robinson says. “So much of the response has been reactionary when it comes to Covid-19. I just hope we can break that cycle.”

2021-01-11 19:30:08+00:00,40,"Exactly one year ago, on January 11, the first death from a confirmed case of Covid-19 was reported in China.

Today, the US is inching toward 400,000 confirmed deaths, the world toward 2 million. With alarming milestone after alarming milestone, the temptation grows to compare Covid-19 to the other horrific pandemics of history. It is not as bad, of course, as the 1918 flu pandemic, or as the notorious Black Death. But it has long surpassed the death toll of SARS (2002-2004), MERS (2012, 2015, and 2018), the 1957-58 and 1968-1970 pandemic influenzas, and the 2009 swine flu. By sheer number of casualties, Covid-19 ranks among the 10 deadliest plagues in history.

Some have taken a stab at putting the pandemic in historical context. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Washington Post visualized the devastating plagues of history, with Covid-19 by comparison a tiny dot. (By today, tragically, it’d be a much bigger dot.) This vivid graphic ranks Covid-19 the ninth deadliest in history

Those rankings should come with caveats. Our methods for measuring the deadliness of plagues past aren’t very good, and there’s a lot of guesswork involved. Our methods for counting the current death toll of Covid-19 have some serious flaws as well. Excess death measures suggest that the official toll is too low, even in countries with fairly good testing and death reporting like the US, and other countries do much less testing and death reporting.

Moreover, while Covid-19’s overall global death toll is among the 10 highest in history, that mostly reflects that the world’s population has grown a lot. The Black Death, which devastated Europe and killed around 30 percent of everyone alive on the continent, likely killed between tens of millions and a hundred million people, while a plague as deadly today, if it spread around the whole world, would kill more than 2 billion.

With those caveats in mind, there is a lot that we can learn from stacking Covid-19 up against history’s most notable plagues. Some of the things that stand out are ways that we got lucky. Most of the plagues that ravaged humanity in previous centuries particularly affected young children and babies, while the coronavirus has mostly spared them. Infection with the coronavirus seems to confer long-lasting immunity, and the virus doesn’t mutate too quickly; we could have been afflicted with a virus that is harder for our immune system to respond to, or that changes quickly enough that our vaccines aren’t effective against variants.

Other lessons from past plagues are reminders of the long road ahead. For example, many of these pandemics lasted years and years, and then became endemic, with recurrences for centuries afterwards. The Black Death, for example, was merely one big recurrence of a disease that had stalked humanity for hundreds of years at that point, and that was a major danger all the way through the invention of antibiotics.

By far the most notable takeaway is that, for most of our history, humanity has been relentlessly stalked by infectious disease. Devastating plagues ravaged major European cities every 20 years, if not more often, through the 1500s and 1600s. Half of children died of disease before they reached adulthood.

Modern medical knowledge and relentless vaccination programs made a world ruled by infectious disease feel like a thing of the past — until it suddenly wasn’t.

But even in this, our plague year, the modern world has seen far less risk of death from infectious disease than people saw in an average year in the premodern world. The coronavirus is a reminder we haven’t entirely triumphed over disease — but, put in its historical context, it’s also a reminder that things used to be much, much worse.

Plagues, ranked

Let’s be clear about this: Ranking all the plagues in human history is a nearly impossible task.

The historical record is often very scant, and some of the worst plagues in history — like the smallpox that swept the Americas after contact with Europe — occurred mostly in societies without written birth or death records, leaving historians stuck guessing at their overall impact.

And making comparisons across pandemics is tricky: The absolute number of deaths from a disease is, of course, the result of both how deadly the disease is and how many people there are. In 1300, the century of the Black Death, there were around 400 million people in the world. By 1918, when the Spanish flu hit, there were nearly 2 billion.

That said, there is enough information for us to compare the worst plagues in history, and there is consensus on the worst of the worst.

At the top, of course, is the Black Death, an outbreak of bubonic plague that spread across much of Asia, Europe, and North Africa in the mid-1300s. The bubonic plague is spread by a bacterium carried in rats and fleas, called Yersinia pestis. Today, it is easily treated with antibiotics, but before they were developed, half of people infected might not survive. The victims would become feverish and achey, while lymph nodes swelled horrifyingly, sometime to the size of a chicken egg — called “buboes,” and the source of the name of the disease. While rats and fleas primarily transmitted it, when it became pneumoniatic (infecting the lungs) it could also spread directly person-to-person.

The Black Plague’s death toll is fiercely debated, with many historians estimating that between 25 million and 200 million people died in the space of five years. That’s a range of 5 percent to 40 percent of the world’s population at the time. For context, confirmed deaths from Covid-19 account for .0025 percent of the world’s population.

A contender for the next most devastating outbreak, the mid-500s Plague of Justinian, was also caused by the bubonic plague. Over the space of about two years, it afflicted the Byzantine Empire and from there, much of Europe. But our records of events from this time period are exceptionally shaky. Some historians believe it represented the first bubonic plague outbreak in history, and they estimate its death toll in the tens of millions. Other historians have pushed back, arguing that later scholarship magnified the plague and that deaths ought to be presumed to be considerably lower (more on this later).

While the various outbreaks of bubonic plague are the deadliest plagues on the list per-capita, they are not actually the ones that have killed the most people. In sheer numbers killed, the Black Death is possibly surpassed by the 50 million deaths worldwide in the 1918-1919 flu outbreak known in the US as the Spanish flu (though it didn’t originate in Spain — it acquired the name because, as the country was neutral in World War I, its toll was more accurately reported there than elsewhere in Europe).

The Spanish flu was an influenza virus much like the ones that circulate our world every year, but much deadlier. It had one particularly devastating quirk. Almost all influenzas are deadliest to the elderly and the very young, but the Spanish flu was exceptionally deadly to young adults. A hundred years later, historians are still theorizing about why that was the case. The Spanish flu mostly killed people through pneumonia — the flu weakened the lungs, after which secondary infections would arrive.

The other devastating killer pandemic of the 20th century — HIV/AIDS, which is estimated to have killed around 35 million people — is quite different from the other entries on the list. While most of them are fast-moving, contagious, or insect-transmitted diseases that swept the world in the space of a few years, HIV/AIDS, which is transmitted only through bodily fluids, spread slowly over the course of decades, abetted by the indifference of politicians who thought at first that the virus only affected gay men.

While HIV/AIDS used to be nearly 100 percent fatal, good treatments now exist, and the virus claims the most lives in poor countries where those treatments are not widely available despite their critical importance. Almost a million people still die every year of HIV/AIDS.

Other pandemics that rank among the worst in history include several influenza outbreaks, including the 1890 flu, the 1956-1958 flu, and the 1968 flu. As the study of viruses was just beginning in 1890, that outbreak’s origins are unknown.

The 1956-58 flu is believed to have originated in China, and the 1968 flu in Hong Kong. Each is estimated to have caused approximately 1-2 million deaths.

What makes some flu seasons so much deadlier than others? We can identify specific deadly features of each of these viruses, but we don’t know for sure what made them emerge in those years and not others — and many public health officials worry a future influenza outbreak could be that bad or worse.

Covid-19, of course, has now been certified as the cause of death for 1.94 million people in the space of one year. That makes it worse in absolute terms than most influenza pandemics in history, except 1918’s; worse than the seven cholera pandemics of the 19th and early 20th century; but much less bad than HIV, 1918, or the Black Death and associated bubonic plague outbreaks. Every mentioned pandemic surpasses it in terms of deaths per capita, though — much of its high death toll is a consequence of the world’s population having grown from about 2 billion in 1920 to more than 7.8 billion today.

The challenge of ranking plagues

Looking closely at the trouble we have had in estimating deaths from the coronavirus this year will make it obvious why historical plague ranking is so imprecise and involves so much guesswork.

How many people have died so far of Covid-19? Official statistics maintained by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering have a precise answer: about 1.94 million. But that is the number of deaths following confirmed cases of Covid-19 — and many people die of Covid-19 without ever getting formal confirmation that is what they had.

Instead, most epidemiologists prefer to estimate the total toll of a disease with a different approach: excess mortality. Simply put, we measure how many people died this year. Then we compare that to an estimate of how many people would have died this year under normal conditions — that is, if there hadn’t been a global pandemic.

This approach isn’t perfect. For example, deaths in car accidents are down while many commutes and vacations are cancelled. Other infectious diseases have been suppressed by the public health measures taken against Covid-19. That has decreased mortality, which will cause us to underestimate Covid-19 deaths if we look at total deaths.

Nonetheless, excess mortality is often the best tool historians have to estimate the toll of pandemics. Here is an excess mortality chart showing excess mortality in the US in 2020:

In general, measuring excess mortality finds that the toll of Covid-19 has been larger than officially reported — even in rich countries like the US. One December study in the Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that from March to August, 220,000 excess deaths attributable to Covid-19 occurred in the US, compared to 169,000 confirmed deaths during that period.

But there isn’t accurately reported excess mortality data for most of the world. Often, there isn’t even accurate data on deaths during previous years that could be effectively used to establish a baseline for excess mortality measurement.

And this problem, while thorny for evaluating the Covid-19 numbers, is especially difficult for most of the other pandemics on the list. Above, I mentioned that the Black Death is thought to have killed as many as 200 million people. But its actual toll is hotly contested by historians. For the Justinian Plague, the situation is even worse. We rely mostly on limited surviving records from a handful of individuals, including the Byzantine court historian Procopius of Caesarea. Some historians estimate its toll might be as high as 100 million dead.

But that’s probably wrong, historian Lee Mordechai and other authors argued in an article last year declaring the Justinian Plague overblown. “The existing direct evidence consists of several historical narrative texts and 2 inscriptions,” they argue — not enough evidence to make claims that tens of millions of people died.

It takes a lot of historical background even to dig into some of the disagreements surrounding the toll of the Justinian Plague or the Black Death. Certainly lots of people died. But do we really know enough to rank historical plagues from least to most devastating, as is so perpetually tempting?

The responsible way to do it is probably with enormous error bars. The Justinian Plague, such a chart might read, killed between 2 million and 100 million people. That’s extraordinary uncertainty — but it’s what we are often working with, when trying to estimate health data from antiquity.

And even the several historical texts and inscriptions are more than historians have to go off when estimating the ravages of smallpox, measles, and other diseases spread by European contact in parts of the Americas that did not have written records. Some believe that up to 80-90 percent of native Americans died; with few records, though, the population of the continent pre-disaster is difficult to estimate.

Historians sometimes rely on DNA analysis, which finds a population bottleneck at the time of contact, estimating that the population of women of reproductive age fell 50 percent. There would likely have been higher mortality in other age groups.

Today’s horrors in perspective

Given all this uncertainty, is there even any value to comparing plagues across history? I do think there are a few crucial takeaways that are not diminished by the uncertainty inherent in such a historical exercise.

The first is that it helps us grasp that diseases can get much worse than the one we are currently facing. Covid-19 has devastated our world, but there are a few blessings: it very rarely strikes children, and its infection fatality rate — the percentage of those who are infected who die — is much lower than for many other famous plagues. Epidemic diseases like smallpox frequently killed 30 percent of those infected. Bubonic plague killed up to half of those it sickened. Both of them were particularly deadly for children.

Another reason such an exercise is valuable is that it can be a crucial reminder that this has happened before and, unless we get spectacularly good at halting outbreaks in their tracks, it will happen again. In an increasingly interconnected world, there will be a next pandemic — whether caused by another SARS-family coronavirus, by an influenza, or by an engineered disease. As the global population nears 8 billion, it would not take a disease anywhere near as deadly as the untreated bubonic plague to become the deadliest outbreak in history.

And yet somehow humanity persists. The bubonic plague is, of course, now treatable. HIV, still a driver of more than 1 percent of all global deaths annually, is not a death sentence anymore with appropriate treatment. Smallpox, the likeliest culprit in the mass deaths in the Americas after European contact, has been eradicated.

The point is: Disease isn’t inevitable. While many countries grapple with spiking coronavirus cases, others that took the disease seriously from the beginning still have remarkably few infections. And better tools for disease surveillance and rapid response might help catch the next coronavirus pandemic at the root.

2021-01-11 13:00:22+00:00,37,"Despite Covid-19 surges in Europe, the United States of America’s extraordinary death toll remains among the worst in the developed world.

As of January 9, 2021, nearly 373,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, with a death rate of more than 1.1 per 1,000 people, according to Our World in Data.

While there are nations with higher death rates, this still puts the US in the top 20 percent for deaths among the world’s developed countries, with more than twice the death rate of the median developed country.

Some numbers to put that in perspective:

If the US had the same death rate as the European Union overall, nearly 79,000 Americans who died of Covid-19 would likely still be alive (unless they died of other causes).

If the US had the same death rate as Germany, more than 212,000 Americans who died of Covid-19 would likely still be alive.

If the US had the same death rate as Canada, nearly 225,000 Americans who died of Covid-19 would likely still be alive.

If the US had the same death rate as Australia, nearly 361,000 Americans who died of Covid-19 would likely still be alive. Fewer than 12,000 would have died, compared to the 365,000 who died in reality.

If the US had the same death rate as Japan, nearly 363,000 Americans who died of Covid-19 would likely still be alive — and fewer than 10,000 Americans would have died of the disease.

As a result of Covid-19 surges in Europe, the US does look relatively better, compared to other developed nations, than in September. Back then, the US had seven times the death toll as the median developed country. That gap has shrunk massively — to two times.

That’s not because the US has done better but because Europe has done much worse. After managing to largely suppress the coronavirus over the spring and summer of 2020, Europe eased up over the late summer and fall, and saw huge surges as a result.

The European surge has engulfed even countries widely heralded as successful for their fights against Covid-19 — such as Germany, which has recently reported a higher daily Covid-19 death toll than the US.

But Europe is still doing better when you look at deaths since the pandemic began; it at least managed to suppress cases for a time — something the US hasn’t been able to do. One of the key reasons the US death toll remains so high compared to other developed nations is because America suffered a huge summer surge of Covid-19 that other places, including much of Europe, managed to avoid.

And there are some countries that have managed the pandemic well. That includes some European nations like Denmark, Estonia, Cyprus, Finland, Norway, and Iceland. But the biggest success stories are Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan — which have broadly adopted more aggressive government measures against the coronavirus than America.

In September, San Marino, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Italy, and Sweden led the US in Covid-19 deaths per million people. But Slovenia and Czechia now also pull ahead of America, while Spain and Sweden have fallen behind.

So why did the US fail so badly? A lot of this comes down to President Donald Trump. He pushed the country to reopen far too early and quickly, calling on states to “LIBERATE” their economies. He abdicated federal leadership and instead forced states, cities, and private entities to pick up the slack on a host of issues, particularly testing and, recently, vaccines. He downplayed the need for masks, outright mocking people, such as President-elect Joe Biden, for wearing them. The list goes on and on.

In comparison, other leaders around the world have taken Covid-19 more seriously — embracing social distancing, testing and tracing, masking, and, when necessary, more extreme measures like lockdowns. Even with the recent surge of the coronavirus, many countries across Europe have reacted quickly and aggressively by imposing lockdowns, slowing the spread of the virus. The US, by comparison, has by and large remained open, with some states still not requiring masks.

Clearly, not everything has gone perfectly in Europe and other parts of the world. A lot of people and places have screwed up their response to the coronavirus, showing that it’s no easy challenge.

But when the numbers are added up, the US remains an extraordinary failure in its handling of Covid-19.",voxdotcom,"['worst', 'developed', 'rate', 'likely', 'nearly', 'europe', 'americans', 'covid19', 'died', 'uss', 'toll', 'world', 'death']",0

Share All sharing options for: Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new Covid-19 variants, in 2 charts

A more contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is a deadlier one. Not because it gets any individual sicker but because it reaches more people. More illness means more cases: more mild cases, more severe cases, more long-term complications, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.

There’s no one perfect estimate for how much more contagious the SARS-CoV-2 variant called B.1.1.7, which was first discovered in the UK, might be. There needs to be more careful lab work done in animals to nail it down, which could take a few more weeks. But preliminary estimates find it to be between 30 percent and 70 percent more contagious. This variant is now popping up all over the world: in the US, throughout Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere. It’s especially concerning, considering that, in the US and elsewhere, the pandemic’s spread is still reaching new heights.

There’s also a variant called 501Y.V2 that was first found in South Africa; it appears less widespread than B.1.1.7, but also to be more contagious than older variants. It’s still possible that other more transmissible variants will emerge in the future. Scientists just don’t know.

Regardless of exactly how transmissible any new variant is, any possible increase in transmissibility is extremely concerning to epidemiologists and others in public health. It means now, more than ever, our collective and individual actions to stop the spread are critically important.

Here are a few key reasons why.

A more transmissible virus simply means more cases

The reason for concern over a more contagious variant of the virus is simple. “Once it [the variant] becomes common, it will accelerate transmission considerably,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a press call. Accelerated transmission means more cases.

That’s because the virus grows exponentially. Any increase in its inherent transmissibility causes an increasingly high number of cases down the line, if control measures don’t also accelerate to keep up.

With a 50 percent increase in infectiousness, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch says. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” It could be higher, he says.

A more transmissible virus means we need to work harder to stop the spread

Epidemiologists think about the transmissibility of a virus with a figure called R, or the basic reproduction number. This describes how many new cases, on average, will follow one case of the virus.

In the beginning of the outbreak, before the world sprang into action, epidemiologists estimated the R to be around 2 or 3. Since then, thanks to our (inconsistently implemented) efforts — mask-wearing, social distancing, business closures, etc — the R has been reduced in many states to around 1.1 to 1.2. But as long as the R figure is greater than 1, the virus can spread exponentially.

Let’s say a community has gotten its R value down to 1. Then a 50 percent more transmissible variant comes along. It could mean that the same mitigation effort that got the old variant of the virus down to 1 now only gets it down to 1.5.

Which is to say: To combat a more transmissible version of the virus, communities need even more stringent controls.

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Let’s say a community has the virus more or less under control. The R value in the area is 1, which means the number of cases in the area remains constant, month to month.

In this scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, and you’ll have 1,000 cases a month from now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes it takes about five days for one infection to cause another). “Now let’s imagine the virus is 50 percent more transmissible. .... 1,000 cases of such a virus now would translate to more than 10,000 cases a month from now if you did nothing!”

A more transmissible virus increases the number of people who need to be vaccinated

A more transmissible virus also increases the threshold for herd immunity, or the rough estimate of the percentage of people in a population who need to achieve immunity, ideally via a vaccination, in order for the outbreak to decrease in size.

Herd immunity thresholds are dependent on the value of R. The higher the R value, the higher the threshold. If a more transmissible variant becomes dominant the world over, it increases pressure on vaccination campaigns to vaccinate even more people. Already, it’s looking like upward of 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to achieve herd immunity (though the exact figure needed is unknown). That’s already an extremely high and difficult bar to clear, given the slow early distribution of the vaccines.

There’s also the yet-to-be-realized possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that reduces the efficacy of the current vaccines.

A more transmissible virus means more death

One good piece of news about the B.1.1.7 variant: So far, it doesn’t seem to be any deadlier than older variants of the virus. That is: Any individual who gets it isn’t any more likely to end up in the hospital or die, according to the early data.

But more infections mean more death. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Switzerland, says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

A 50 percent more contagious virus is even a deadlier concern than one that’s 50 percent more deadly, as London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains on Twitter.

If a city has an R value of 1.1 and there are 10,000 people infected, in one month’s time, you’d expect to see 129 deaths, he says.

Increase the deadliness of the virus by 50 percent in that scenario and you’d expect 193 deaths — a 49.6 percent increase.

Increase the contagiousness of the virus in this scenario by 50 percent and you get 978 deaths, Kucharski finds. That’s a 658 percent increase. That’s a theoretical calculation, but the central point is the exponential effect, as Kucharski explains.

The above is just an illustrative example, but the key message: an increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity). 5/5 — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) December 28, 2020

It’s not entirely clear if this will come to pass

Again, the estimate of 50 percent increased transmissibility is just an estimate. And even if new variants are more transmissible, it could be hard to predict how much more transmissible it will be in different locations.

Hanage stresses that the 50 percent more transmissible figure being reported is based on how this variant behaves in the UK. In a different place — with different adherences to social distancing, different mitigation measures in place — the new variant could behave differently. It’s complicated, yes, but that’s outbreaks for you.

But even the hypothetical threat of a more transmissible variant is a call for action.

To stop more mutations from happening, to stop more potentially problematic variants from popping up, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, told me in a December interview. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

The new variant mean our individual actions matter more than ever. This variant spreads in the same manner as other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the same precautions apply. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and ventilation are as important as ever.

With the new variant around, Lipsitch says, “Your isolation and quarantine and contact tracing is considerably more important, even more than it was before. So you’re doing more for the world.”",voxdotcom,"['r', 'epidemiologists', 'means', 'thats', 'virus', 'covid19', 'worried', 'charts', 'variant', '50', 'variants', 'transmissible', 'cases', 'number']",0
2021-01-09 11:01:14+00:00,19,"A new, seemingly more contagious variety of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — that has been spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom has now been found in the United States in at least two locations.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced December 30 that the new strain, known as B.1.1.7 (we’ll call it the UK variant, for simplicity’s sake), was detected in the southern part of the state. It’s the second report of the UK variant in the US in as many days, following news that the variant was found in a male Colorado National Guard member in his 20s with no history of travel, a sign that the virus is spreading locally.

“There is a lot we don’t know about this COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement.

The evidence that this new strain spreads more easily between people is not rock solid, but it’s concerning enough to have forced dramatic action, like shutting down travel from the United Kingdom earlier this month. But it wasn’t enough: The variant has now been detected in Canada, Spain, Sweden, France, and Italy, among others.

At the moment, it doesn’t appear as though the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 is more dangerous in individuals. It doesn’t seem to make people sicker, nor is it more likely to kill them. “I think the key point is that there is no evidence now … that this virus is more pathogenic — creates more problems, more morbidity and mortality — than the previous virus,” Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, said during a December 21 press conference.

What it does appear to do, at least based on preliminary evidence, is spread more quickly among people. That alone is a problem: The coronavirus spreads fast enough as it is. Compounding concerns is that the UK variant echoes a similar story in South Africa, where a strain called 501.V2 has become the dominant version among new cases of the virus. Scientists are wondering whether that strain is more transmissible, too.

The virus has been continually changing its genetics through the course of the pandemic. That’s what RNA-based viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do — they mutate. Most of the time, the mutations mean nothing. But this time, something is different.

“I’ve spent a lot of time this year reminding people that mutations are normal,” molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, who works on a project called Nextstrain, said. For the entire pandemic, scientists around the world have been collecting genetic information about SARS-CoV-2 in a public database called GISAID. Hodcroft and her colleagues at Nextstrain draw on this database to closely track genetic changes in the virus.

In the past, mutations haven’t warranted big newspaper headlines. “I’m now finding myself singing a slightly different tune,” Hodcroft said. This time, there does seem to be evidence that the new strain is something worth being vigilant about. “We probably should consider taking some precautionary measures while we’re trying to find out more,” she added.

At the same time, Covid-19 is surging around the world, even without these new mutations. Scientists are still trying to figure out what these new variants of the coronavirus actually mean for the pandemic. It’s also unclear where else the UK variant may have already spread, aside from the countries where it has been detected. While it was reported in the US only this week, it could have been in the country for much longer. “The variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported December 22.

The good news is that we already know how to respond to these new variants: in the same way we’ve been responding to the pandemic overall. The virus still transmits primarily through viral-laden breaths in the air. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and good indoor ventilation are as critical as ever.

There’s a lot about this story that’s potentially very alarming or confusing. And the story is not yet complete, as scientists need more evidence to understand whether these new variants pose a new threat.

To add some clarity, here’s what researchers have learned so far. Let’s start with the basics.

Viral mutations, explained

Viral mutations. New strains. Increased transmission. It all sounds like scary science fiction. But to demystify things, and to understand why scientists are a little concerned about this new variant — and why most variants don’t faze them — it’s worth understanding how viruses mutate in the first place.

“Oftentimes, I think the word mutation in general conjures up a lot of things in people’s minds, like, you know, Ninja Turtles or X-Men or cancer, like zombie apocalypse-type stuff,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said. “A mutation is just a lot more mundane than that.”

Viruses mutate because they’re constantly making copies of themselves in enormous numbers. To accomplish this, they have to hijack the hardware of a host cell that they infect. However, this process can be a bit sloppy.

Within a human body, a virus can replicate itself millions or billions of times, Hodcroft explains. If you were writing a draft of something millions of times on a computer, extremely quickly, you’d probably make some typos. That’s what’s happening with the viruses. “They make a typo” in their genetic code, she says. One letter of their ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain is replaced with another.

Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, like SARS-CoV-2, are particularly vulnerable to mutations since the RNA molecule itself is more unstable than DNA. The process of copying RNA is also more prone to error.

These typos can be very useful for scientists because they happen at a regular rate, and are passed down through generations of the virus as it spreads through a community. Often, scientists can use these subtle changes to trace certain strains’ lineage and their spread through a population.

The majority of these typos are inconsequential when it comes to human health. “One typo, or even a few typos, doesn’t usually change how the virus works,” Hodcroft says. Some even harm the virus. “You’re much more likely to break it than to make it better” when it comes to mutations, she says.

But in rare instances, some mutations can give a virus an advantage, like allowing it to infect cells more readily or spread among people faster. Those mutant strains can then become dominant within a population.

That might be what we’re looking at here with the UK variant; this new strain may have accumulated typos that could make it more easily transmitted between people.

Four lines of evidence converging on this new mutation being more transmissible

So why do scientists think this variant is more transmissible?

They don’t have this nailed down yet for sure, but four converging streams of evidence are all pointing in the same direction. “That’s making people feel like maybe there is something here to be worried about,” Hodcroft says. “Each one of these things on their own, I would say is not necessarily convincing.” But all together, they paint a concerning picture.

One is that in the areas of the UK where this new variant is spreading, it is accounting for a larger proportion of new cases. “What this implies is that this new variant is spreading better than other variants that are circulating in the same region,” she says.

National testing data shows increased prevalence of the variant in positive cases over time. This is detected incidentally by the commonly used 3-gene PCR test because 69-70del leads to a negative signal. But this does not effect the results of the test. 7/

h/t @The_Soup_Dragon pic.twitter.com/aPpAjjb35W — Muge Cevik (@mugecevik) December 21, 2020

A second is that the increase didn’t co-occur with any overly obvious change in human behavior. “We don’t really have strong evidence that everyone in the southeast [UK where this variant is spreading] has just ripped their masks off and is, you know, totally violating restrictions,” she says. That said, it could be a coincidence. It could be just that people who happen to have contracted this variant have it are spreading it more often via their behavior.

After all, “this new variant has emerged at a time of the year when there has traditionally been increased family and social mixing,” according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which estimated that the transmissibility of the new variant has increased by 70 percent compared to prior versions of the virus. Both Rasmussen and Hodcroft say the 70 percent more transmissible figure is most likely an overestimate. A recent, not yet peer-reviewed study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine used a mathematical model to estimate that the new strain may be 56 percent more infectious.

Third, there’s some early data about how this variant acts in Covid-19 patients. “There may be slightly higher viral loads in patients with the variants,” Hodcroft says, suggesting the virus has an easier time replicating in the body. (Viral load refers to the amount of virus in the patient. Rasmussen also cautions that viral load data is really sensitive to timing and when the patient was sampled in the course of the illness, so there needs to be more data to confirm this.)

Finally, the genetic changes in the UK variant mirror changes in the South African variant, which has also been associated with rising case numbers. That makes a plausible link: that this particular genetic change may be behind the increased transmissibility in both variants.

However, this is still short of definitive confirmation that the new variant is more transmissible.

According to Slaoui, figuring this out for certain would require laboratory animal testing to see how easily the virus can spread from one organism to another. But this testing can take several weeks.

In the face of that uncertainty, many urge caution.

Again, there’s still no evidence this new variant causes more severe disease. The evidence points only to increased transmissibility. But a more transmissible virus is still a concern. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Hodcroft says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

What does the mutation ... do?

The UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 actually contains 23 mutations in the genome of the virus. “We don’t really know what they do,” Rasmussen says. Individually, many of these mutations have already been seen in other strains of the virus around the world. But the combination of these changes in a single virus could be making the new variant more likely to spread.

However, scientists do think that some mutations may be more important than others, and there are several mechanisms by which mutations could make the virus more infectious. Those include:

1. The virus could end up with changes to its spike protein that allow it to enter cells more easily.

2. The virus could develop a mechanism to replicate more quickly inside a body, which would lead “to people becoming infectious faster, or contagious faster than they would with another variant,” Rasmussen explains.

3. The virus could theoretically have evolved an ability to counteract the cell’s innate immune defenses, making it easier to infect that cell.

One of the pathways scientists suspect may be at work stems from the N501Y mutation, where the amino acid asparagine is replaced by the amino acid tyrosine in the 501st position of the viral protein sequence. It’s one of several mutations in the virus’s spike protein in the UK variant, but N501Y is in the part of the spike that actually comes into direct contact with human cells. The same mutation has been found in the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 that’s also quickly spreading.

Since the virus attaching to a host cell is critical to the virus’s reproduction, the virus’s spike protein is especially important — and delicate.

“If you were just making random changes in the lab, almost any change you make in that area would result in just a dead virus that can no longer get into the cell,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University Texarkana. “That fact that this thing is able to spread at all tells you that it’s at least as good as the original version. The fact that it’s spreading faster may indicate that it’s a little bit better at grabbing on to host cells, which is the first step of the entry process.”

But this particular N501Y mutation has already been detected in strains that have risen and fallen in other parts of the world over the course of the pandemic. So it may be that the other mutations coupled with N501Y are having some sort of compounding effect. And scientists still need to do more work to determine if this is actually what’s causing the rise of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Finding out the answer could help researchers come up with ways to counter this variety of the coronavirus.

How did these coronavirus mutations happen?

Scientists don’t know exactly how the UK variant came to be. But there may be a clue. Hodcroft is struck by the sheer number of mutations in the UK variant — 23 in all — which makes her suspect it’s possible this variant arose in an immunocompromised person. “It’s an above-average number of mutations,” she says.

In most people, she explains, the immune system mounts a full-on assault on the virus, eliminating it in a matter of a couple of weeks. “In people that have compromised immune systems, though, there’s a very different dynamic,” she says. “So, for one thing, the virus could be in them for months instead of weeks.” That gives the virus more time to evolve, to accumulate mutations that might make it easier to thwart the immune system.

“It’s one scenario,” she says. “We may never know exactly what happened here.”

The basic truth: The more this virus spreads, the more chances there are for dangerous new variants to emerge. In any person — or animal, for that matter — the chance for a dangerous new variant to arise is rare. But rare things can happen when there are so many cases: more than 80 million confirmed cases worldwide.

Since viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are mutating and since Covid-19 has spread in so many people, it’s theoretically only a matter of time before a certain set of mutations align in a way to give the virus a boost.

What can we do about Covid-19 mutants?

To stop mutations, quite simply, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Rasmussen says. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

We fight the new variant as we would any variant of SARS-CoV-2: with masks, with social distancing, with good hand hygiene. “I don’t think people should be panicking,” Hodcroft says. “Lower case numbers, no matter what the variant, are better.”

It’s already been said but if we actually follow protocol and have policies that support those protocols a new variant that is more transmissible would be combatted just as an older variant. So like worry less about mutants and more about masking and distancing and vaccination. — K. Taylor, Ph.D., M.S. (@KYT_ThatsME) December 21, 2020

Scientists have one more tool, though: genetic tracking. At Nextstrain, Hodcroft and her colleagues receive viral genetic sequences from all over the world to try to paint a real-time picture of transmission chains and keep tabs on how the virus is changing. But not every place in the world is providing the same amount of data.

The UK does a lot of viral sequencing, for instance. It was able to pick up on the new viral strain quickly because of that. In other locations around the globe, that might not have happened so fast.

“In the US, it’s a really spotty picture,” Hodcroft says when it comes to sequencing. “Some states have really invested in sequencing; some states haven’t. So for some states, we probably have a fair idea of what’s going on. In other states, we really don’t have many sequences.”

Overall, the CDC reports that the US has sequenced only 51,000 of the more than 17 million cases reported in the country. That’s 0.07 percent. In comparison, the UK aims to sequence 10,000 virus samples per week, and plans to increase that capacity further. (In addition: The UK sequences the genomes faster than the US, according to infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford.) That lack of viral genetic testing creates a big blind spot in the US. The UK variant could have already arrived here undetected “given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced,” the CDC states.

More sequencing, overall, would lead to the faster detection of new strains and faster means to contain them if they were deemed problematic.

Do mutations mean a Covid-19 vaccine won’t work anymore?

With new mutations, there is a concern that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 could arise that would be different enough from previous versions such that prior exposures — whether through a vaccine or an infection — won’t offer protection. So, yes, it’s possible that the coronavirus could someday mutate in a way that would elude a vaccine or previous immunity.

Right now, though, scientists think this UK variant would still fall under the same umbrella of protection as earlier strains. If someone received a Covid-19 vaccine for an older generation of the virus, they would likely have protection against this one.

To explain why, it helps to understand how the immune system deals with viruses. When the human body detects a hostile foreign entity like a virus, it starts to produce antibodies (proteins that attach to the virus or to infected cells). Antibodies can then interfere with how the virus works. They can also flag the virus or virus-infected cells for destruction by other immune cells.

The specific places where the antibodies attach to the virus are called epitopes, and most Covid-19 vaccines target epitopes on the virus’s spike protein (which is what the virus uses to attach to human cells and enter them).

“The good thing with the vaccine is that it induces an immune response against several epitopes that have been mapped around the spike protein,” Slaoui said. “The chances that one set of mutations would alter all those epitopes, I think, are extremely very low. The expectation, scientifically, is that these kinds of variations are unlikely to escape fully the protective response by the vaccine.”

More good news: Scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch have announced (via a tweet) preliminary evidence that antibodies that neutralize the more common strain of the virus also neutralize a strain with the N501Y mutation (the one that impacts the part of the virus that comes into direct contact with human cells, as mentioned above). That suggests that an immune system primed — by a natural infection, at least — to fight the old variant can also fight one with this specific mutation.

Some good news (and incredibly fast work) on one of the mutations scientists are worried about: N501Y.

In these lab experiments serum from recovered #covid19 patients was just as good at neutralizing virus with the mutation as without it. https://t.co/SIxfo2x3qp — Kai Kupferschmidt (@kakape) December 22, 2020

Texas A&M’s Neuman noted that there’s also evidence right now showing how well vaccines can protect against mutated forms of the virus in clinical trials. Many of the vaccines being administered were engineered to counter the earliest generations of SARS-CoV-2 but are still showing themselves to be highly effective against Covid-19 caused by more recent versions of the virus.

“All the tests are being done, all the papers being published, are being done with current strains, which have several mutations relative to [the first iterations of the virus], and it does still seem to be working,” Neuman said.

Covid-19 vaccine developers say they are keeping a close eye on these changes and testing to make sure their vaccines are still effective. “In terms of the new variant, Pfizer and BioNTech are monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequence changes and the companies are working to generate data on how well serum from people immunized with [the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine] may be able to neutralize the new strain,” said a Pfizer spokesperson via email.

And the new Covid-19 vaccines are well equipped to adapt. The two that have received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration — the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine — both use mRNA as their platform. These vaccines deliver the instructions for making the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Those human cells then manufacture the component themselves, allowing the immune system to use it to prepare for an infection. One huge advantage of this approach is that the mRNA sequence can be altered quickly; the first such vaccines for Covid-19 were developed within days after the genetic sequence of the virus was posted online.

Could manufacturers like Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech then retool their vaccines to target the new variants without going through the whole tedious clinical trial process again?

Possibly, according to Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA and a professor of medicine at Georgetown University. He told Vox that vaccines for new variants of the influenza virus are approved every year without large-scale trials. New versions of a Covid-19 vaccine to accommodate mutations similarly might not need another round of study in tens of thousands of people, but may require some testing to figure out dosing and immune response. With such a new virus and brand new vaccines, the regulations for these situations have not yet been laid out.

Should we expect more mutations in the future?

Short answer: yes.

The UK and South African variants are unlikely to be the last to make headlines. Coronavirus is constantly evolving. We should expect it to keep changing slightly.

“There will be new variants that emerge,” Rasmussen says. The thing is, with each new significant strain, scientists will have to do careful work to determine whether it’s more dangerous.

And there are some mutations we can perhaps even expect — if not in the coming weeks, over the next several years.

Recently, virology researchers at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center published a preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) study, looking at how a coronavirus that causes the common cold evolved from the 1980s onward. To accomplish that, they got old blood samples, which included antibodies that cling to this particular virus. They also reconstructed pieces of the cold virus from other eras. Basically, they wanted to see if older blood could still neutralize newer virus. If it couldn’t, that would indicate the virus has evolved over time to evade the immune system.

Here’s what the researchers found: “This other human coronavirus does indeed evolve over the course of multiple years to gradually escape human immunity,” Jesse Bloom, a virologist who co-authored the study, says. “So we think this suggests that there’s the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to do the same thing.” But Bloom stresses that this process takes years. It’s enough time to prepare, to monitor, and to potentially tweak vaccine formulations to keep up with the virus’s evolution.

It’s not like the virus can evolve into an entirely different beast. “It can mutate to maybe escape antibodies,” Rachel Eguia, the study’s lead author, says. But it can’t change so much that it alters its ability to enter cells.

Scientists are also keeping their eyes out for a rapid, major mutation event known as recombination. That’s where an individual is infected with two different strains of the virus at the same time, allowing the virus strains to swap parts. These new viruses could then evade the antibodies that targeted their predecessors. Some researchers think that recombination might be how SARS-CoV-2 originated in the first place.

“This is all hypothetical in this particular virus, but it happens in other viruses all the time,” Neuman said.

Faced with these looming challenges, reducing the transmission of the coronavirus in general is still the best way to protect the fragile progress made in the Covid-19 pandemic so far. Reducing transmissions is also one of the best ways to make sure powerful tools like vaccines remain potent for as long as possible. The fact that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are coming out is not a cause for complacency, and these new variants of SARS-CoV-2 highlight how important it is to remain vigilant.

Share All sharing options for: Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new Covid-19 variants, in 2 charts

A more contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is a deadlier one. Not because it gets any individual sicker but because it reaches more people. More illness means more cases: more mild cases, more severe cases, more long-term complications, more hospitalizations, and more deaths.

There’s no one perfect estimate for how much more contagious the SARS-CoV-2 variant called B.1.1.7, which was first discovered in the UK, might be. There needs to be more careful lab work done in animals to nail it down, which could take a few more weeks. But preliminary estimates find it to be between 30 percent and 70 percent more contagious. This variant is now popping up all over the world: in the US, throughout Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere. It’s especially concerning, considering that, in the US and elsewhere, the pandemic’s spread is still reaching new heights.

There’s also a variant called 501Y.V2 that was first found in South Africa; it appears less widespread than B.1.1.7, but also to be more contagious than older variants. It’s still possible that other more transmissible variants will emerge in the future. Scientists just don’t know.

Regardless of exactly how transmissible any new variant is, any possible increase in transmissibility is extremely concerning to epidemiologists and others in public health. It means now, more than ever, our collective and individual actions to stop the spread are critically important.

Here are a few key reasons why.

A more transmissible virus simply means more cases

The reason for concern over a more contagious variant of the virus is simple. “Once it [the variant] becomes common, it will accelerate transmission considerably,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a press call. Accelerated transmission means more cases.

That’s because the virus grows exponentially. Any increase in its inherent transmissibility causes an increasingly high number of cases down the line, if control measures don’t also accelerate to keep up.

With a 50 percent increase in infectiousness, “in less than two weeks, you get twice the number of cases,” Lipsitch says. “And in a month or so, you have four, five times as many cases. But that’s very approximate.” It could be higher, he says.

A more transmissible virus means we need to work harder to stop the spread

Epidemiologists think about the transmissibility of a virus with a figure called R, or the basic reproduction number. This describes how many new cases, on average, will follow one case of the virus.

In the beginning of the outbreak, before the world sprang into action, epidemiologists estimated the R to be around 2 or 3. Since then, thanks to our (inconsistently implemented) efforts — mask-wearing, social distancing, business closures, etc — the R has been reduced in many states to around 1.1 to 1.2. But as long as the R figure is greater than 1, the virus can spread exponentially.

Let’s say a community has gotten its R value down to 1. Then a 50 percent more transmissible variant comes along. It could mean that the same mitigation effort that got the old variant of the virus down to 1 now only gets it down to 1.5.

Which is to say: To combat a more transmissible version of the virus, communities need even more stringent controls.

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Let’s say a community has the virus more or less under control. The R value in the area is 1, which means the number of cases in the area remains constant, month to month.

In this scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, and you’ll have 1,000 cases a month from now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes it takes about five days for one infection to cause another). “Now let’s imagine the virus is 50 percent more transmissible. .... 1,000 cases of such a virus now would translate to more than 10,000 cases a month from now if you did nothing!”

A more transmissible virus increases the number of people who need to be vaccinated

A more transmissible virus also increases the threshold for herd immunity, or the rough estimate of the percentage of people in a population who need to achieve immunity, ideally via a vaccination, in order for the outbreak to decrease in size.

Herd immunity thresholds are dependent on the value of R. The higher the R value, the higher the threshold. If a more transmissible variant becomes dominant the world over, it increases pressure on vaccination campaigns to vaccinate even more people. Already, it’s looking like upward of 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to achieve herd immunity (though the exact figure needed is unknown). That’s already an extremely high and difficult bar to clear, given the slow early distribution of the vaccines.

There’s also the yet-to-be-realized possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that reduces the efficacy of the current vaccines.

A more transmissible virus means more death

One good piece of news about the B.1.1.7 variant: So far, it doesn’t seem to be any deadlier than older variants of the virus. That is: Any individual who gets it isn’t any more likely to end up in the hospital or die, according to the early data.

But more infections mean more death. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Switzerland, says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

A 50 percent more contagious virus is even a deadlier concern than one that’s 50 percent more deadly, as London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains on Twitter.

If a city has an R value of 1.1 and there are 10,000 people infected, in one month’s time, you’d expect to see 129 deaths, he says.

Increase the deadliness of the virus by 50 percent in that scenario and you’d expect 193 deaths — a 49.6 percent increase.

Increase the contagiousness of the virus in this scenario by 50 percent and you get 978 deaths, Kucharski finds. That’s a 658 percent increase. That’s a theoretical calculation, but the central point is the exponential effect, as Kucharski explains.

The above is just an illustrative example, but the key message: an increase in something that grows exponentially (i.e. transmission) can have far more effect than the same proportional increase in something that just scales an outcome (i.e. severity). 5/5 — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) December 28, 2020

It’s not entirely clear if this will come to pass

Again, the estimate of 50 percent increased transmissibility is just an estimate. And even if new variants are more transmissible, it could be hard to predict how much more transmissible it will be in different locations.

Hanage stresses that the 50 percent more transmissible figure being reported is based on how this variant behaves in the UK. In a different place — with different adherences to social distancing, different mitigation measures in place — the new variant could behave differently. It’s complicated, yes, but that’s outbreaks for you.

But even the hypothetical threat of a more transmissible variant is a call for action.

To stop more mutations from happening, to stop more potentially problematic variants from popping up, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, told me in a December interview. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

The new variant mean our individual actions matter more than ever. This variant spreads in the same manner as other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the same precautions apply. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and ventilation are as important as ever.

With the new variant around, Lipsitch says, “Your isolation and quarantine and contact tracing is considerably more important, even more than it was before. So you’re doing more for the world.”",voxdotcom,"['r', 'epidemiologists', 'means', 'thats', 'virus', 'covid19', 'worried', 'charts', 'variant', '50', 'variants', 'transmissible', 'cases', 'number']",0

There were 3,964 Covid-19 deaths reported on Wednesday, according to the New York Times’s database. The US is now averaging about 2,700 deaths daily over the last seven days. In total, 361,383 Americans have died in the pandemic.

Every important Covid-19 metric — cases, deaths, and hospitalizations — is at or near its record high in the waning days of the Trump administration.

Despite the rollout of two vaccines, the death totals are going to continue to climb alongside hospitalizations. Public health experts have said they expect the holiday season to continue to take a heavy toll, the full extent of which will take several weeks to be seen in the numbers. A new, more contagious variant of SARS-Cov-2 has arrived, cropping up in states across the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Director Robert Redfield warned at the beginning of December that the US could see as many as 450,000 Covid-19 deaths by February. Yet there’s been no significant federal mobilization to combat the surge.

Public health experts point the finger squarely at the White House, as well as state leaders, to explain the record-breaking Covid-19 numbers being reported across the country.

“It’s really from my perspective because of failed leadership at the state and federal level that we’re in the position we’re in,” Harry Heiman, a clinical professor at Georgia State University, told me this week.

President Trump has barely commented on the pandemic since Election Day, while fomenting discontent over his electoral loss that led to Wednesday’s siege at the Capitol. Meanwhile, the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines that could help end the pandemic has become a mess on his watch.

Heiman said his hope for turning the tide in the pandemic was President-elect Joe Biden bringing in an “A-team” and providing more resources to states for their Covid-19 response and vaccine efforts.

After the Democratic victories in the Georgia Senate runoffs, the other big event in this historic week, Biden should have a better chance of passing legislation to fund those efforts. Some additional funding for hospitals and local health agencies is already on the way, part of the second Covid-19 relief package that passed in December. Biden has said additional funding will be a top priority when he takes office.

2021-01-07 12:30:09+00:00,11,"In the past couple of weeks, experts and pundits have debated a big question surrounding the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna: Do we stick to two doses for every person, spaced a couple of weeks apart, as originally planned? Or should we go ahead and give out single doses to more people even when we’re not sure we’ll manage the second dose as planned — to get a shot in as many arms as possible, even if there’s less certainty about the efficacy of that approach?

Britain has taken the latter approach, and much of Europe looks inclined to follow.

And on Friday, the Biden administration said that on taking office, Biden would release all doses currently in reserve so that more people can get their first shot. The president-elect’s transition team said it expected the move would not delay second doses, but it would likely have that effect to some extent. The FDA had previously said the US should not change vaccine dosage schedules without more data.

To understand this debate, let’s rewind the tape to mid-December, when the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine against Covid-19. A similar vaccine from Moderna was approved shortly after. Both are highly effective at protecting people from getting sick and dying from the coronavirus. But we are just a few weeks into the rollout and we don’t have enough doses, with some 18 million shipped so far for a population of about 330 million — and lots of at-risk people aren’t yet vaccinated. Meanwhile, a more contagious virus variant is spreading, and vaccine distribution in the US is going more slowly than initially planned.

Some prominent scientists and public health researchers have proposed adapting the US’s vaccine approach in response. They suggest getting as many people the first dose as possible, even if that means there aren’t doses available to deliver the second shot on schedule (three or four weeks after the first dose, depending on the vaccine). Both Pfizer and Moderna tested the efficacy of giving people two doses of the vaccine, spaced three weeks (Pfizer) or one month (Moderna) apart. This two-dose regimen is 95 percent effective against the virus. But according to data from their trials, getting just one dose still reduces a person’s chances of getting Covid-19 by 80 to 90 percent, at least initially.

That finding is what has prompted the proposal that we delay giving people second doses until everyone has a first dose. The idea is simple: You have two people eligible for a vaccine. Does it make sense to vaccinate the one who’s already been vaccinated with a second dose, or the one who hasn’t been given a dose at all? By using a two-dose regimen, we’re choosing the one already vaccinated, despite the vaccines’ scarcity.

Britain has already moved ahead with such an approach, delaying second vaccinations with the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine for as long as three months in order to get more people the first dose.

The debate over this proposal in the US gets at many of the biggest challenges of doing science in the middle of a pandemic like this one. We like to approve drugs and vaccines only once we’re highly confident in our approach — but in a pandemic, we sometimes have to guess with our best-informed estimate, not with a rigorously demonstrated solution. Waiting months for additional research could cost lives, so we may have to decide what we’ll do in the interim as we wait for that work.

This debate is important in its own right: Figuring out the right way to vaccinate will mean the pandemic ends weeks or months sooner. But it’s also a debate about something deeper, a challenge that has recurred throughout the pandemic: How should we think about expertise and policy in the face of incomplete data and uncertainty?

The case for delaying the second dose to get more shots into arms now

An mRNA vaccine like the one from Pfizer and Moderna contains a strand of RNA that the body interprets as instructions to build a protein. That protein is a key one on the virus that causes Covid-19, and once the instructions are executed, the immune system sees the unfamiliar protein and learns how to mount an immune response.

In the clinical trials, Pfizer and Moderna tested the efficacy of their vaccines by giving two doses, one month apart, to people in the trial group, and giving two placebo shots to people in the control group. Their research was aimed at estimating the efficacy of the whole regimen. But they collected data on outcomes throughout the trial, which means we do know how well the first shot prevented Covid-19 by itself, during the weeks before the second shot was delivered. And the answer is that it worked reasonably well.

“We do not know for sure, but for at least a month or more, a single shot mRNA vaccines should provide ~90% protection,” Yale virologist Akiko Iwasaki wrote in a Twitter thread calling for delaying the second dose, citing an additional Moderna analysis of patients who for whatever reason missed their booster shot. Iwasaki’s estimate of 90 percent effectiveness is in the ballpark of estimates from other experts, though it’s an extrapolation from limited data (more on that below).

“Giving 100 million people — particularly those at high risk — a single shot that is 80 to 90 percent effective will save far more lives than giving 50 million people two shots that are 95 percent effective,” Brown University School of Public Health dean Ashish Jha and University of California San Francisco Department of Medicine Chair Robert Wachter argue in a Washington Post op-ed.

There’s not much data on the question of how long the immunity from the first dose will persist without the second dose. But, Wachter and Jha argue in their piece, we don’t see immunity start to wane over the weeks after the first dose, and “experts believe it is extremely unlikely immunity would somehow plummet by week eight or even week 12 following a single shot.” And hopefully by the time immunity does start to decline, there’ll be greater availability of vaccine doses, and booster shots can be provided to everyone who needs them.

What’s uncontroversial among public health officials is that giving two doses, as studied, is the ideal thing to do. We know that the two-dose regimen works. The evidence points to protection from two doses being stronger than protection from one dose. Even the strongest proponents of delaying the second dose agree that in an ideal world, the second dose would happen on time — and some of them have argued that for the highest-risk populations, such as those in nursing homes, it’s worth doing a second dose even if the second dose is being delayed for the general population.

The dispute is over what to do given the deeply non-ideal situation we face. There aren’t enough vaccines for everyone who wants them. It may be many months before there are. In the meantime, a new, more contagious variant of the virus is spreading, and hospitals are overwhelmed. Ideal solutions, argue proponents of delaying the second dose, aren’t what we have available.

On Friday, the Biden administration suggested they will move US policy in the direction of aiming for more first doses. “The President-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans’ arms now,” transition spokesperson TJ Ducklo told CNN.

The case for offering the second dose on time

In a statement on Monday, the FDA directly addressed the debate, coming down against delaying the second dose.

“[A]t this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence,” its statement reads. “Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19.”

After noting that the evidence about the lasting efficacy of a single dose is very limited, the agency statement argues, “If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks.”

“We must not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by administering vaccines in any way besides that for which they were carefully evaluated,” Georgetown virologist Angela Rasmussen and University of Alberta infectious diseases doctor Ilan Schwartz argued in the Guardian, citing worries that we don’t know how long immunity lasts and that partial immunity could invite the spread of strains that the virus doesn’t address.

Other experts told the New York Times that they worried delaying the second dose would undermine trust in vaccination and increase vaccine hesitancy, making it harder to get everybody vaccinated.

“Even the appearance of tinkering has negatives, in terms of people having trust in the process,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, told the Times. “The longer the duration between doses, the more likely people are to forget to come back,” she said, adding, “Or people may not remember which vaccine that they got, and we don’t know what a mix and match might do.”

Moncef Slaoui, a scientific adviser to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, has said the administration is considering allowing half-doses of the Moderna vaccine. But Slaoui said in an emailed statement to the Times on Sunday that “the approach some countries are taking of delaying the booster shot could backfire and could decrease confidence in the vaccines.”

Given the absence of data, some have advocated doing full-fledged studies comparing the efficacy of one dose versus two. That’s what physician Peter Bach argues at Stat News: “this study could enroll 30,000 participants in a handful of weeks and start generating insights in a few months. If we move on this question, and I can’t think of a more important one to prioritize, preliminary data could be in hand by March.”

The FDA’s statement, which mentioned half-dosing and delayed dosing as “reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials,” does not seem to rule out such a study, but no one has yet announced plans to conduct one.

What the one-shot, two-shot debate has to teach us about uncertainty and science

The pandemic has repeatedly challenged some assumptions of science communications, where journalists confidently report what is evidence-based and what has “no evidence.” That vocabulary has shaped the conversation about vaccine dosing; for example, Pfizer has said there is “no data” to demonstrate that the immunity from the first dose lasts more than 21 days.

It’s true that length of immunity from the first dose is not what their clinical trials studied. But scientific evidence isn’t all-or-nothing like that. In many cases, scientists (and historians, and researchers in every field) have deeply limited evidence about the topic of interest. Often they’re in a position of trying to make inferences from the results of other similar events, from a few unusual data points that arose due to accidents, or from measured results that were not the primary aim of the trial they were measured in.

Sources of evidence like these are being employed when researchers try to estimate the likely duration of immunity from a single vaccine dose. The UK’s Working Group that made the delayed dosing recommendation “concluded that vaccine efficacy will be maintained with dosing intervals longer than 21 days … based on clinical trial data that showed the vaccine was 90.5 percent effective against preventing Covid-19 after the first dose once the protection that starts at around 12 days kicks in, and there was no evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine is declining toward the end of the 21-day period following the first dose,” a spokesperson said.

From one perspective, that study produced “no data” about effectiveness past 21 days. For another research team, it shows there’s “no evidence” of declining effectiveness.

It seems reasonable to move past claims of “no evidence” and instead acknowledge we’re dealing with limited evidence — not ideal, but not total ignorance either. We do know some things: Booster shots are common for vaccines, but usually to make immunity years-long or lifelong; in general, immunity doesn’t vanish in the space of just a few months, and immunity from Covid-19 after contracting it looks like it’s typically longer-lasting than that (though vaccines with mRNA are new and we have less evidence about their long-term effects on immune function). The evidence from the few participants in trials who missed their booster shot is limited, but it’s still evidence.

“It’s been a repeated problem throughout the pandemic that we have relied on this ‘we have the evidence/we don’t have the evidence’ binary, meaning that we have moved slowly, waiting for rock-solid confirmation; but moving faster, making decisions on imperfect information, would have saved a lot of lives,” British science journalist Tom Chivers argued in an article Wednesday about the difference between the US and UK approaches to vaccination.

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are incredibly valuable for determining how well vaccines work, decisions about vaccination in a pandemic require many judgment calls that we unfortunately cannot assess in advance with an RCT. And to be clear, concerns like whether the change in vaccination schedules will limit public confidence in the vaccine, increase vaccine hesitancy, or prompt individuals to take risks, believing themselves fully immune when they aren’t, are very legitimate and should no doubt feature in our reasoning and planning about vaccination.

But those concerns have also not been rigorously demonstrated in an RCT. No one has conducted a controlled study on how delaying the second dose will affect vaccine hesitancy. Instead, public health officials who raise vaccine hesitancy concerns are looking at lots of factors and making their best informed prediction about what will happen — and public health officials who estimate that delayed second dosing is worth it are doing the same thing.

It’s tempting, when faced with decisions of this magnitude, when lives are at stake and the pandemic has frayed our nerves and our trust, to want to retreat to the solid, reassuring embrace of perfect knowledge. But almost all the key questions before us will never be answered to our satisfaction in an RCT, at least not immediately. What increases vaccine hesitancy? How much risk compensation will there be? Will delaying the second dose save lives by getting vaccines first to those who need them?

There’s no proven truth to retreat to at this moment, just our best guesses — and the fight to gather more information and make better guesses next time.",voxdotcom,"['dose', 'data', 'biden', 'vaccine', 'delaying', 'vaccines', 'immunity', 'hold', 'second', 'shot', 'evidence', 'doses']",0
2021-01-06 19:10:04+00:00,12,"We knew it was going to be a long, dark winter. But unfortunately, it’s now looking even more grim. Just as the first coronavirus vaccines began rolling out in the US and countries around the world in December — offering hope for the end of the Covid-19 pandemic — two fast-spreading variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were discovered in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

Within a matter of weeks, the new variants replaced other versions of the virus in some regions. Scientists say these variants help explain the recent peak in cases in the UK and South Africa that have forced new and tough social distancing measures. They’re also proliferating around the world. As of January 17, the UK variant had been found in 60 countries, and the South Africa variant in 23, according to the World Health Organization.

“It’s scary, isn’t it?” said Richard Lessells, a University of KwaZulu-Natal infectious disease specialist in Durban, South Africa, who co-discovered the South Africa variant. “I’m a Scotsman so talking about my emotions doesn’t come to me naturally but I have a lot of anxiety at the moment.”

All viruses mutate as they move through populations, and until recently, the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 weren’t cause for much concern. (A mutation is a change in the genetic makeup of a virus while a variant is a virus that has a suite of mutations that alter how it behaves.)

B.1.1.7 in the UK and 501Y.V2 in South Africa each have a startling number of changes in the virus’s spike protein, the part that fits into the receptor in human cells, allowing it to infect people — and these changes may be why the new variants are seemingly more contagious than earlier versions of the already contagious virus. (There’s already increasing alarm over variants that have emerged in California and Brazil — and these are just the ones we know about right now.)

While there’s no evidence they cause more severe disease, more cases mean further stress on hospitals and, after that, a rising death rate.

And some researchers have another, pressing worry: These mutations could render the current Covid-19 vaccines less effective. Or they could mean the virus eventually “escapes” them all together. That’s why doctors, virologists, and other health researchers are calling on officials to “vaccinate 24/7 like it’s an emergency,” as Scripps Research scientist Eric Topol said on Twitter. “Because it is.

If we wanted to get serious vs B.1.1.7

—get N95/K95 masks to all and enforce their use

—get rapid home testing big supply to each household for daily use

—amp up digital, mobility, genomic and wastewater surveillance 100X

—vaccinate 24/7 like it's an emergency. Because it is. — Eric Topol (@EricTopol) January 5, 2021

While vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and BioNTech say their technologies can readily adapt to changes in the virus, we’re still learning about how the shots will work in this new context — and the mutations in South Africa’s 501Y.V2 are causing particular concern.

As the virus continues to spread and more people are infected, the likelihood of even more dangerous mutations happening rises. So too does the threat the mutations pose to the vaccines. So, without drastic countermeasures, the variants could herald a new, potentially even more difficult, chapter in the pandemic.

Why the new Covid-19 variants are different — and more worrisome — when it comes to the vaccines

Scientists have warned that it was always possible the coronavirus could evolve to evade the Covid-19 vaccines that have been approved so far. The arrival of the UK and South Africa variants may be a step in that direction, increasing the odds of the vaccines becoming less effective over time.

In SARS-CoV-2, the main mutations scientists care about are on the spike protein of the virus — the part that allows it to enter human cells. This is also the protein that Covid-19 vaccines currently available in the US (from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech) are designed to imitate. About 4,000 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been detected at various points in the pandemic. Most haven’t altered the function of the virus and haven’t stirred worry.

In rare cases, a mutation, or several at the same time, lead to changes that give the virus a greater advantage. And that appears to be what’s happening with the UK and South Africa mutation.

The UK variant, B.1.1.7, contains 23 mutations in the genome of the virus while the South Africa variant, 501Y.V2, has at least 21 mutations, with some overlap between the two. In both cases, the changes seem to have increased the fitness of the virus, or its ability to propagate.

“[With genomic sequencing in South Africa] we can show quite clearly there were lots of different lineages circulating prior to October,” Lessells said. “Within the course of just a few weeks, this new lineage — 501Y.V2 — became almost the only lineage you’re detecting.” The story is similar in England, where one in 50 people were infected with Covid-19 as of the new year.

The fact that these mutations became so dominant so quickly suggests that they may be more contagious. Scientists in South Africa think the variant that emerged there is about 50 percent more transmissible, and one estimate suggested the UK variant is up to 70 percent more transmissible.

There could also be other more familiar variables that are driving the spread of these new variants, like holiday travel. Scientists still have to complete experiments in animals to pinpoint differences in transmissibility between these mutations and earlier versions of the virus — and to what extent shifts in peoples’ behavior might also explain the growth in cases.

But they’ve already zeroed in on concerning changes in the virus that are relevant to vaccine effectiveness. With the South Africa variant, for example, one change of particular interest is the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the virus where it latches on to human cells.

So currently when we're thinking antibody response and protection from infection, E484K is the more concerning mutation of those we're seeing currently. Found in SA but it will pop up elsewhere as well and in combination with different other mutations. So what we need now are: /4 — Dr. Tara C. Smith (@aetiology) January 5, 2021

“The E484K mutation has been shown to reduce antibody recognition,” said Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at the University College London, in a statement. This means it can help the virus “bypass immune protection provided by prior infection or vaccination.”

Researchers have demonstrated how this might happen in cell culture and small human experiments. One, described in a pre-print paper (and therefore not yet peer-reviewed) on Biorxiv, looked at several generations of SARS-CoV-2 challenged with antibody-rich plasma from a Covid-19 convalescent patient and watched to see what happened. At first, the antibodies seemed to beat back the virus. But as the virus mutated, eventually making the E484K substitution, it started to proliferate in spite of the presence of the antibodies.

The senior author on the study, Rino Rappuoli, a professor of vaccines research at Imperial College and chief scientist at GSK, told Vox that when he and his colleagues first ran the experiment, they didn’t know how relevant their findings would be. “But when the South Africa and UK variants came along, we looked at [our data] and saw that, in real life, the first steps of what we saw in vitro are happening.” (GSK has a Covid-19 vaccine in clinical trials with the drugmaker Sanofi.)

Other scientists are coming to similar conclusions. In a second preprint, researchers tracked how mutations altered the effectiveness of the antibody response in people who had the virus. They also found E484K has antibody evasion capabilities. A third, also in test tubes involving survivor plasma from donors in South Africa, showed that antibodies from a prior infection were totally ineffective against the new variant in about half of the donors.

A couple of caveats here: These studies are in vitro, involving the specimens from Covid-19 survivors, rather than antibodies from someone who received a vaccine. We don’t yet know how people in clinical studies who got a vaccine will respond to the new variants.

Still, Rappuoli said, the findings are cause for concern nonetheless. “If given enough time under immune pressure, this virus has the possibility to escape.”

Another preprint study, from researchers in Brazil, recently provided an alarming example of how this could play out. The paper documents the case of a 45-year-old Covid-19 patient with no co-morbidities: months after her first bout with the illness, she was reinfected with a version of SARS-CoV-2 that had the E484K mutation — and experienced more severe illness the second time around. It’s limited evidence, but it suggests that surviving an earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection isn’t a guarantee of protection against variants with this mutation.

“The finding of the E484K, in an episode of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection might have major implications for public health policies, surveillance and immunization strategies,” the authors wrote.

Researchers are racing to figure out how vaccines work against the variants

So what does this mean for the vaccine rollout effort? Will pharmaceutical companies have to tweak their existing vaccines to fight the new variants?

“It is one of the key questions that we are trying to find answers to at the moment, and we have groups around the country working around the clock to get a better understanding of this,” said Lessells. “This also involves collaboration with other groups around the world, with groups running the vaccine trials, with vaccine developers.”

Rappuoli said even if there’s no evidence yet showing the variants can outsmart the immune response created by vaccines, “we should be prepared that at some point in the future that may happen,” he added. For Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center scientist Trevor Bedford, that point could come as early as autumn this year:

501Y.V2 is still largely restricted to South Africa, but it (or other antigenically drifted variants) may spread more widely in the coming months. I would be planning this potential ""strain"" update for fall 2021. 9/10 — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) January 20, 2021

Vineet Menachery, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch, said the laboratory experiments on SARS-CoV-2 variants represent “the worst-case scenario.”

The currently available vaccines in the US — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — help the immune system target multiple areas of the spike protein, so the virus would have to change drastically to completely escape the immune response generated by the vaccines. He called the odds of this happening “unlikely but not impossible.”

The diversity of immune responses at the population level gives University of Utah evolutionary virologist Stephen Goldstein some comfort, too. “Our immune systems have evolved to deal with antigenic drift — or the selection of different variants of circulating viruses,” he said. “I’m not worried vaccine efficacy is going to fall off a cliff and go from 95 percent to zero.”

A few people have asked ""do new variants mean vaccines won't work""? Important to avoid simple categories of 'works' and 'doesn't work'. Some variants may alter the extent of protection (and some probably won't) and question is whether this change matters (and at what scale)... 1/ — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) January 19, 2021

The incoming Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Rochelle Walensky, also took comfort in the very high rate of protection the vaccines already have. “The efficacy of the vaccine is so good and so high, that we have a little bit of a cushion,” Walensky said in a January 19 interview with JAMA.

And if the vaccines do turn out to be less effective against the new variants, vaccine developers say they’ll be up for the challenge of adapting them. That’s because the new platforms they’re using can be modified easily to counter new threats.

Vaccine developers say they can adapt their technologies fast

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine both use a molecule called mRNA as their platform to deliver instructions for making the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca that recently received approval in the UK (but not yet in the US) uses a reprogrammed version of another virus, an adenovirus, to shuttle DNA that codes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Human cells then read that DNA or mRNA genetic information and manufacture the spike protein themselves, allowing the immune system to use it for target practice. An advantage of using this approach is that vaccine developers only need to modify DNA or mRNA to tweak the vaccine, something they can do quickly and easily if necessary.

In a January 19 preprint, BioNTech and Pfizer found the UK’s variant may not pose as much of a threat to their vaccine: Antibodies in blood samples from people who got the shot appeared to work against the B.1.1.7’s mutations, making it “unlikely” the variant will escape the vaccine. If a stronger viral foe comes along, BioNTech’s chief executive Ugur Sahin told the FT, “we could manufacture a new vaccine within six weeks.”

These new vaccines would not necessarily require developers to go through every regulatory hurdle again, former FDA chief scientist Jesse Goodman told Vox in December. Instead, new versions of Covid-19 vaccines could end up going through an approval process similar to vaccines for seasonal influenza — with some initial testing but stopping short of massive clinical trials. That means revised Covid-19 vaccines could potentially roll out quickly.

Lessells was cautiously optimistic for another reason: Even if the current vaccines stop working as well as earlier clinical trials suggested, he said, “There are many vaccines in development. So as we learn more about this virus, the vaccine developers also learn from that, and different vaccines may be developed.”

But while it may be possible to alter the vaccine to adapt to new mutations, it’s not ideal: It would require expensive changes in the vaccine production process and eat up valuable time that could be used to inoculate more people during a devastating pandemic.

“From a cost and manufacturing perspective, it would put us far, far behind,” said Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher and a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

Now’s the time to drive down case numbers and vaccinate

That’s why researchers and health officials are hoping to drive down case numbers and rapidly build up herd immunity with the existing vaccines while also getting ready for changes to the virus that may lay ahead.

To track mutations and understand how they may impact vaccine effectiveness, governments also need to invest more in genomic sequencing, Lessells said. And right now, “there’s a lot of variability around the world in how much sequencing is being done and how people are using sequencing.”

Inadequate sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes may create blind spots where new mutations could be lurking. Infectious disease experts told Stat’s Helen Branswell that the US doesn’t sequence enough and may be unaware of how widespread the UK variant is because of that. According to Lessells, the UK sequences about 10 percent of its cases — on the high end of sequencing volume globally — while the number in South Africa is closer to 1 percent.

Of course, there’s another way to prevent dangerous mutations from arising: preventing cases from happening at all through mask-wearing, social distancing, rapid testing, and treating and isolating infected people. The virus can’t mutate if it’s not replicating inside lots of people.

“The bottom line hasn’t changed: We need to suppress the amount of viral transmission as much as we can,” Goldstein said. Vaccines are a part of that suppression effort, but social distancing and masks are too. According to Salim Abdool Karim, chief adviser on Covid-19 to the South African government, social distancing measures in the country appeared to be bending the curve. “Outbreaks grow exponentially and you’re not going to vaccinate at an exponential rate,” he added. “But you can bring outbreaks down to a rate where they are not growing exponentially.”

For now, the emergence of the worrisome mutations is a reminder that, despite our collective fatigue, there’s still a long road ahead, Lessells said.

“We keep passing these milestones — going into a new year, having Christmas — and thinking that the virus is going to suddenly do something different because we are celebrating or whatever. Of course, that’s not the case. We are still in the early days. We are still learning about this virus.”",voxdotcom,"['sarscov2', 'mutations', 'africa', 'virus', 'covid19', 'pose', 'threat', 'vaccine', 'south', 'vaccination', 'variant', 'variants', 'vaccines']",0

As part of Trump’s last-ditch effort to overturn Biden’s victory, he and his supporters (in and out of Congress) have been hyping Congress’s expected certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory Wednesday as the final opportunity to “stop the steal.” Trump fans planned a slate of protests near the Capitol building in Washington, DC, starting with rallies on Tuesday. Yet another will take place on Wednesday, at which Trump himself says he will speak.

And they’re not off to a great start.

Trump fans began gathering on Tuesday in Freedom Plaza and outside the Capitol, where recently pardoned Trump ally Roger Stone spoke. At the Freedom Plaza event, a variety of fringe far-right speakers alternately profanely denounced antifa, said George Soros “owns” Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, described the coronavirus as “fake” — and, in one especially shocking moment, even encouraged rally attendees, who gathered mostly without masks despite the coronavirus pandemic, to hug each other.

“It’s a mass-spreader event!” said podcast host Clay Clark.

""I'm going to give everyone three action steps ... turn to the person next to you and give them a hug. Someone you don't know ... it's a mass-spreader event! It's a mass-spreader event!"" pic.twitter.com/NVRN9HdzSl — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 5, 2021

From the livestream, it’s difficult to see how many (if any) rally-goers followed his advice.

Later, staunch Trump ally and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell pushed long-debunked conspiracy theories about how Democrats allegedly stuffed ballot boxes. He also alluded to the possibility of civil war if Trump’s loss isn’t somehow overturned.

“You need to pray for our vice president to look up to God and say, ‘I need to make a decision, Lord,’ and make the right decision for our country,” Lindell said, alluding to Mike Pence’s role overseeing Wednesday’s Electoral College certification process. “You don’t have a [civil] war when the other side didn’t win anything ... they were trying to steal it from us.”

Trump has heavily promoted the Wednesday portion of the event, touting it on Twitter as a “BIG Protest Rally” that “could be the biggest event in Washington, DC, history” — one aimed at pressuring members of Congress to stop the “steal” of the election from him. On Tuesday afternoon, he tweeted that he plans to speak to his supporters at 11 am on Wednesday. In other tweets, he echoed the rhetoric speakers at the rally used by calling antifa “a Terrorist Organization” and cited the size of the gatherings to put pressure on Republican senators who so far have not joined his effort to overthrow the election.

I hope the Democrats, and even more importantly, the weak and ineffective RINO section of the Republican Party, are looking at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. They won’t stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen. @senatemajldr @JohnCornyn @SenJohnThune — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2021

Of course, the election was not stolen — the Trump campaign hasn’t produced any credible evidence of fraud, and court after court has rejected Trump’s claims — and with the legal process played out, there’s little Trump and his allies can do at this point to overturn the election results. The rallies on Tuesday and Wednesday ultimately are a step in the grieving process for Trump supporters who will soon have to adjust to life under President Biden, as well as a window into what a significant portion of the Republican base looks like post-Trump.

While Clark’s public encouragement of coronavirus spread is definitely problematic, it’s also important to note that people still have a right to peaceably assemble, even in cases where speakers spread blatant lies and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. But authorities are worried that Wednesday’s pro-Trump rallies could turn out likes ones last month that culminated in violence.

DC police are bracing for more unrest

During the most recent pro-Trump rallies in DC — which took place on December 12, two days before the Electoral College voted to officially make Biden president-elect — four people were stabbed during an altercation involving the Proud Boys, a far-right, racist, street-fighting group that was name-checked by Trump during one of the presidential debates. Authorities also say Proud Boys were responsible for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that hung outside the historically Black Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.

There are indications that the Proud Boys planned to take things a step further this time around. On the right-wing social media site Parler, group chairman Enrique Tarrio wrote last week that the Proud Boys “will turn out in record numbers on January 6th but this time with a twist” — wearing all-black so members can blend in with left-wing counterprotesters.

“We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you,” Tarrio wrote. “The only thing we’ll do that’s us is think like us! Jan 6th is gonna be epic.”

But Tarrio was arrested while traveling into DC on Monday on property destruction charges stemming from the alleged December church vandalism. Ominously, Tarrio was also charged with “possession of high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, which is a legal term for a magazine that allows guns to hold additional bullets,” the Washington Post reported, adding that “the devices were found during the arrest.”

In an effort to prevent violence, DC police banned all firearms in the vicinity of where the pro-Trump rallies are planned, and Mayor Muriel Bowser has urged residents to stay away from the area. Tess Owen of Vice reported that the arrest of Tarrio and perceptions that police aren’t standing with pro-Trump protesters have caused a bit of a schism between far-right agitators and the cops, with “Tarrio’s supporters and ardent Trump fans ... putting the DC Police Department in their crosshairs” on right-wing social media sites. One Parler post even threatened to burn down a DC police precinct.

If the past is precedent, Trump is far more likely to pour fuel on the fire than he is to try and tamp things down, especially considering that things won’t go his way inside the Capitol on Wednesday. Ultimately, if the worst that happens is more reckless hugging during a pandemic, then DC authorities will chalk up Wednesday as a success.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'rallies', 'victory', 'event', 'start', 'proud', 'protests', 'election', 'dc', 'steal', 'downtown', 'supporters', 'bleak', 'lastditch', 'tarrio']",0
2021-01-05 22:00:05+00:00,6,"India will begin vaccinating 300 million people following the emergency approval of two coronavirus vaccines earlier this week.

The country was the second (after the United Kingdom) to rubber-stamp the inexpensive and easy-to-store AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine. But the approval of a second vaccine, the domestically developed Covaxin, is raising concerns because it was given while phase 3 trials of the drug are still underway and before its efficacy data has been made public.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi cheered the approval of both vaccines on Twitter, calling it “a decisive turning point to strengthen a spirited fight” against the pandemic. Modi also congratulated the country’s “hardworking scientists and innovators” for their efforts, which he said would make India healthier and Covid-19-free.

But many health experts and activists are demanding more transparency and the release of data on the drugs’ efficacy.

In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on India, the world’s second-most-populous country — with the second-highest number of coronavirus infections, after the United States — as it begins its vaccine rollout.

According to data from Johns Hopkins, the country of 1.4 billion has reported more than 10 million cases and 150,000 deaths as of January 5. Lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 have had a deleterious impact on India’s economy, which was already hurting before the pandemic began. About 24 percent of India’s GDP was erased from April to June 2020, so getting the virus under control is critical for improving the country’s economic outlook.

The Indian government and the pharmaceutical companies say both vaccines are safe to use and will prove invaluable to India’s fight against Covid-19, especially after some experts suggested the potentially more infectious strain of the coronavirus might already be in the country.

To meet the challenge of one of the biggest vaccination efforts in history, experts say the Indian government needs a credible scientific voice — a Dr. Anthony Fauci for India, if you will — to help with transparency, as well as to ensure best standards are met and that vaccines get to those in need.

India’s two coronavirus vaccines, briefly explained

Although India has granted emergency authorization to two vaccines, Covaxin, developed by the Indian company Bharat Biotech in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the country’s National Institute of Virology, is the one causing some controversy.

In a January 3 press statement, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the government body responsible for implementing new drugs and overseeing clinical trials in the country, said the results from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the drug show it is safe and provides immune defense from Covid-19.

Per the World Health Organization’s guidelines, phase 1 of an experimental vaccine trial includes giving the vaccine to a “small number of volunteers to assess its safety, confirm it generates an immune response, and determine the right dosage.”

In phase 2, “The vaccine is usually given to hundreds of volunteers, who are closely monitored for any side effects, to further assess its ability to generate an immune response.” Phase 3 is when researchers get a look at how the vaccine behaves in the real world.

Covaxin’s phase 1 and 2 trials involved far fewer participants — approximately 800 individuals, according to the DCGI press statement — than the bigger phase 3 trial, which is still underway. About 22,500 people have received the vaccine as part of the phase 3 trial, which began in mid-November 2020.

But that trial is still ongoing and the data from it has not been publicly released — and though Covaxin is built on an inactivated virus platform, which has been used to develop well-known vaccines for diseases like polio and hepatitis A, experts and activists are still concerned.

That’s because, as Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington, DC, told me, “It is difficult to reach any definitive conclusion without safety and efficacy data.”

“Phase 3 data are not yet in the public domain, and until then it would not be advisable to use this vaccine outside of clinical trial settings,” he added.

In a January 5 interview with the Indian news outlet the Wire, Dr. Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s foremost vaccine experts, said she wouldn’t take the Covaxin vaccine until data on its efficacy is made public.

All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a health watchdog group, also expressed shock at Covaxin’s impending emergency authorization in a letter posted to Twitter the day before approval was officially given. The group has asked the DCGI to reconsider its decision, arguing there hasn’t been enough data presented on the drug’s efficacy.

Despite the objections, India’s Drugs Controller General VG Somani told reporters January 4 that he would “never approve any vaccine if there are any safety concerns. Covid-19 vaccines are 110% safe,” according to the Hindustan Times.

Bharat Biotech CEO Dr. Krishna Ella responded to criticism of his company’s vaccine in a January 4 press conference, during which he blamed much of the negative response to the vaccine on what he called “a backlash against Indian companies.”

“That is not right for us. We don’t deserve that,” he said.

Ella also said his company was being transparent with data and had produced more than 70 articles, if people could be patient enough to read them.

But AIDAN, the watchdog group, took issue with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine as well, requesting more specific data from trials both abroad and within India. AIDAN also asked for estimates of how effective the “dosing regimen and dosing schedule” would be in India.

The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, called Covishield in India, will be produced by the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer. Also known as AZD1222, that vaccine might be a particularly strong option to help less-wealthy countries curb the coronavirus pandemic because it is cheaper and easier to store.

As Vox’s Julia Belluz and Umair Irfan explained, the AstraZeneca vaccine is “among the most likely to be affordable to low- and middle-income countries. And considering much of the world’s population currently lives in low- and middle-income settings, it’s the jab that — with a 90 percent efficacy result — could make a big dent in the pandemic worldwide.” (There are continued questions, however, around just how effective the vaccine is, given dosage problems that arose in the vaccine’s phase 3 trial.)

Unlike the two leading vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, which must be stored at really cold temperatures, the Covishield vaccine can be kept in a standard refrigerator for up to six months, making large-scale distribution easier. Both Covishield and India’s homegrown Covaxin can be kept at a temperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 46.4 Fahrenheit) and require two doses.

Still, distributing vaccines to all of India’s population is going to be a gargantuan challenge.

The vaccine distribution numbers in India are challenging

India plans to provide voluntary inoculations to 300 million people this year, using many of the same tools and practices it uses to conduct elections, which are the world’s biggest.

As in the US, workers on the front lines of the pandemic in India will be the first to receive the shots. But India will also include people over the age of 50 alongside health care workers in the first batch. After that initial phase, people under 50 with underlying conditions like heart disease, which increase the risk of death from Covid-19, will be vaccinated. Everyone else will get the vaccine based on available supply and how the pandemic develops.

Officials will use electoral rolls to identify people over 50. People who are eligible for the vaccine must preregister to receive their shots at one of thousands of local centers, which are run like polling places. Mobile teams will be deployed to help administer the vaccine in more remote and tough-to-reach locations.

According to the government’s plans, successful implementation requires effective training and organization of all workers involved in the vaccination process. Because the scale of the plan is so massive, all steps in the vaccine introduction will be supervised and monitored.

The Indian government will digitally track who has received the vaccine using the COVID-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system, a platform that can trace vaccination “on a real-time basis.”

Although such a big effort will have considerable challenges in procurement, delivery, and vaccine demand, Laxminarayan says India’s success with the eradication of polio and the country’s “steady strengthening of its immunization program over the years” will be apparent during the Covid-19 vaccination campaign.

“I have little doubt that India will capably manage the procurement and delivery of vaccines, including of getting a cold chain system in place, but the public communication aspect is still lacking,” he said.

On January 3, mock vaccinations were held across India to iron out any bumps in the process before hundreds of millions get real shots.

For now, as the controversy over the emergency approval of Covaxin suggests, the most immediate challenge is one of public communication.

As Laxminarayan said, “There needs to be a credible scientific voice at the very top that is clear, transparent, and reassuring that the best standards are being met to make sure that vaccines reach everyone.”",voxdotcom,"['plan', 'indias', 'explained', 'indian', '300', 'india', 'phase', 'covid19', 'covaxin', 'vaccine', 'vaccinate', 'coronavirus', 'million', 'data', 'pandemic', 'vaccines']",0

Share All sharing options for: How the ultra-wealthy could try to cut in line for the Covid-19 vaccine

Could the rich and famous of Silicon Valley be vaccinated before it is their turn?

That thought bothers everyone from California’s governor to the doctors across the state who make a mint treating these millionaires and billionaires. And it might not be such a hypothetical, say a dozen medical veterans and other close observers of the process, who worry about everything from highly paid physicians contorting their moral compasses to the rich cashing in on their political and personal connections.

The wrath of the coronavirus has not been felt equally across America. Black and low-income Americans have been ravaged by its health and economic destruction, while the wealthy and well-connected have decamped to vacation homes, enjoyed superior access to testing and experimental treatments, and watched their net worths skyrocket. So if the vaccination process — the path out of the pandemic — is equally riddled with inequities, it would only fit a pattern and confirm something we’ve long known to be true: The ultra-rich have much, much better health care.

Just how easy it will be for the wealthy to cut in line depends on how exactly the line is queued, and those details remain vague even to the Silicon Valley physicians who are being hounded with phone calls. That vagueness means the precise playbook for how anyone might circumvent the rules remains to be written.

Few close observers expect widespread abuse in Silicon Valley or elsewhere, but there is a shared concern among experts interviewed by Recode that there will be at least isolated attempts to get the vaccine in advance due to the possible life-or-death payoffs of obtaining it.

The misconduct that could unfold is crystallizing as California, which has more billionaires than any other state, spells out how exactly it will play defense against these hijinks. In recent weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been ratcheting up his rhetoric and promising that the state will not be lenient if it finds out that doctors or patients have flouted protocols. The state has also begun to back up that promise, with more details on enforcement and penalties expected this week.

California’s medical board, for instance, last week warned doctors across the state that their medical license could be revoked if they ignored the state’s prioritization guidelines. Newsom has also promised to aggressively shame any doctors or patients who cut in line.

“I’m not naive to the prospect there are going to be some issues,” Newsom told reporters last week. “We’re going to have to work with our county partners to monitor that behavior at the local level ... and make sure someone’s not passing a few vials over to their cousin or aunt or uncle or, God forbid, making a buck or two on the backs of vaccine that should be distributed to someone who’s at higher risk or higher need.”

There are three main avenues for abuse, according to medical insiders from across the Bay Area who spoke to Recode.

One is through the wealthy’s use of concierge doctors, high-end physicians who claim to offer better access to medical care in exchange for hefty fees. It’s possible they will face substantial pressure from demanding “clients.” Another set of concerns revolves around the personal networks of Silicon Valley’s high-powered executives, who may have ties to biotech companies, hospital boards, governments, or other places to favor trade. And a final worry is that the wealthy follow the rules as written — but work to interpret the rules in a more favorable fashion, such as recasting the definition of who in California counts as an “essential worker.”

Here is how things could go wrong.

What billionaires can’t get from their doctors

Concierge doctors in the Bay Area — who can cost as much as $40,000 a year, with some even accepting that payment in cryptocurrency — have had to talk about something very out of character over the past few weeks: all of what they can’t do for that money.

On preemptive weekly newsletter blasts to their patients, on their daily deluge of calls with vaccine-hungry clients, and on conference calls with fellow concierge physicians, these doctors steel themselves for uncomfortable conversations. Yes, they will help their patients get their shots the first minute that it is allowed. But even luxury services have their limits.

“There is no magic”

“There is no magic,” said Sabina Shnapek, who manages the business operations of Peninsula Doctor, a concierge office. “We cannot do something that is extraordinary. I wish I could, but we don’t have this kind of power.”

And yet Peninsula Doctor promises its clients that it is working to “make sure that we get the fastest delivery that we can” of the vaccine. In Southern California, one practice brags that it will “be among the first clinics to administer the vaccine.”

Concierge doctors market themselves and pride themselves on delivering results like this. In return for the subscription-like fee, these doctors limit their practices to just a few dozen families, offering them introductions to best-in-class specialists, home visits, and their cellphone numbers to call or text 24/7. And concierge medicine has exploded in popularity over the past decade or two as income inequality grew and bespoke services for the ultra-wealthy grew in turn.

In the Bay Area, concierge doctors largely service families with ties to the tech industry, and health equity advocates are worried that their eagerness to deliver results for these families, no matter how difficult, in return for the paycheck could encourage misconduct.

Concierge doctors across Silicon Valley tell Recode they are confident that almost all of their patients plan to abide by state and federal guidance and would not seek to be vaccinated ahead of their turn. And they bristle at any suggestion that they would enable those clients if asked: They are concierge doctors, but doctors nonetheless, and bound by medical ethics.

But the incentive — and, sometimes, the expectation from clients — is there, and even a few isolated incidents could compromise public trust in the fairness of the vaccination process. Some private conversations at least illustrate the demand for early access.

One family that emigrated to the Bay Area from China told Margaret Miller, a Silicon Valley concierge physician, that they had grown so frustrated with the speed of America’s vaccine-approval process that they were planning to travel back to China, which has already greenlit a vaccine, to get inoculated. (The family didn’t ultimately do so.)

One patient of Yumi Ando, another Silicon Valley concierge doc, gingerly asked her: “What kind of illness can you use for me to enable me to get on the higher-priority list?” Ando recalled that she flatly declined the request, which she described as vague.

A few concierge practices say they have applied to California for their own stash of doses. To boost their chances of being approved, some of those have already purchased or are pursuing ultra-cold freezers to help store the vials. But even most of those practices don’t expect to receive vials of vaccine until several months from now.

So part of the conundrum for these patients is that it’s not clear what exactly their expensive doctors can do to help them cut in line in California. Could their doctor exaggerate a patient’s comorbidity to high-risk status, upgrading an asthma or diabetes condition from minor to something more serious? To many concierge doctors, that pretty plainly qualifies as fraud.

“I paid all this money. And what are you going to do for me?”

It is not like last year, when several Bay Area concierge doctors recalled patients pressuring them for prescriptions for the drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment. They could, theoretically, write the scrip then, but now, concierge doctors say they are in a more ethically unambiguous position.

“I certainly can see scenarios where people might feel pressure with, ‘Hey,’ — and you know, this is a line we get a lot — ‘I paid all this money. And what are you going to do for me?’” said Ando. “And so the desire to serve is there. But you don’t want to cross the line of going into falsification. I mean, there’s some areas where you can bend the truth a little bit and you definitely try to be a patient advocate. But when I think you’re talking about a finite resource, it’s different.”

This pressure is likely to be at its most extreme at the most expensive concierge offices — or within a practice’s even-more-exclusive “VIP” tier.

“The higher you charge, the more is expected,” said Mark Savant, a concierge doctor in San Francisco. “I think people who do pay more will have certain expectations that their doctor would be able to procure some of these vaccines when, in fact, they can’t.”

Cashing in on connections

Some Bay Area medical insiders say it’s not what happens at these specialty practices that should scare us, but what happens at traditional medical facilities. That’s because they have little faith in California’s ability to monitor each and every dose.

The worry from these people is that there will be “leaks” of drugs — that is, instances when vaccine vials somehow go missing or unaccounted for and end up being part of the favor trade. There is some anxiety that this could be particularly possible in Silicon Valley.

Taryn Vian at the University of San Francisco, who studies corruption in the health care system, said she was perturbed by the amount of discretion that hospitals or doctor’s offices will have after the vaccine arrives at their facilities. She wants stronger safeguards that govern how each facility makes its decisions.

“The CEO of a major hospital is going to know some of these wealthy people, or know someone who is going to use their influence to ask for a favor,” said Vian. “You’re going to want to help them. So we really need to rely on systems in place that don’t allow for one person to make that kind of decision.”

Experts fear that Silicon Valley players on the boards of Bay Area hospitals — or the hospitals’ big philanthropic donors who already receive special treatment — could seek favors or be solicited by their contacts. There is also the concern that Silicon Valley executives and investors may have connections to biotech companies that they may try to call upon. (The vaccine maker Moderna, for instance, is backed by some venture capitalists.)

While kicking a few vials to a business school buddy would likely lead to significant legal exposure, it is not unheard-of in Silicon Valley health care for patients to utilize their connections to try and achieve better care. For instance, Miller, one of the concierge doctors, recalled a patient once successfully utilizing a contact at a biotech company to deliver an experimental test to their child that at the time was only being used in intensive care units.

“The unwritten rule of being wealthy in this country is that the written rules don’t apply to you”

Rather than trading favors, Silicon Valley’s rich could trade money. Mehrdad Ayati, who operates a concierge practice in the Bay Area, said he was alarmed about the possibility that essential workers could strike deals to “sell” their spots to the rich if identity checks aren’t as rigorous in distribution lines as they should be.

“From the point of view of the very wealthy, the unwritten rule of being wealthy in this country is that the written rules don’t apply to you,” said one Bay Area concierge doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess his clients.

Changing the definition of an “essential” worker

But what if the ultra-rich could become essential workers themselves?

A final set of concerns is more structural: The Bay Area elite might manage to classify themselves as essential employees, thereby granting them authorized early access to vaccines. There’s nothing novel about that approach: Corporate America at large is engaged in a fierce lobbying battle over which industries are classified as “essential” and should be prioritized for vaccination.

California has outlined a dozen categories of workers who are considered essential. But the lack of clear definitions over who falls into those groups could theoretically allow individual counties — that have to implement the guidance from the state’s health department — to prioritize the privileged.

One of those categories is employees in the state’s “financial services” industry who are “needed to maintain orderly market operations.”

While that language probably refers to workers such as bank tellers, it is unclear to observers how exactly California will enforce that definition. Is it possible that investment bankers or venture capitalists or CEOs who consider themselves to be needed to maintain orderly market operations could consider themselves essential workers — and qualify for early access?

“They’re not looking at it as an ethical decision. They’re rationalizing because they’re a leader of a company that has millions or thousands of employees. They say, ‘I’m essential to this company. And therefore I’m holding up the economy — and the economy is really in danger right now. So I’m doing a good thing by making sure that I don’t get sick because I’m leading these people,’” said Vian. “They’re not seeing that ‘there’s a person right now who isn’t getting the vaccine because I got it.’”

And California’s guidance is technically only a recommendation. Different counties could exercise some leeway. There’s little stopping one county from declaring various parts of Silicon Valley’s startup economy to be “essential.”

Will we even know if vaccine line-jumping happens?

For now, all these concerns remain hypothetical. They are what could happen. The problem for Newsom, for Silicon Valley, and for society at large is that we might not even know if abuse does occur.

There’s little doubt that the backlash to any incident would be fierce. One need look no further than the public anger toward institutions that have fumbled the vaccine rollout, including at hospitals in Silicon Valley like Stanford’s.

One Silicon Valley medical leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe confidential conversations, said some wealthy people had asked him about whether it would be possible to gain private access to the vaccine — outside of government distribution — but declined to make a run for it because they were skittish about the public relations blowback if they were to get caught.

That fear of a bad headline could be a powerful force in keeping the system honest. That’s not true only in California, with its preponderance of billionaires, but in any place or industry where the wealthy and well-connected might seek an advantage.

“There is something really special about having rules, you know?” said Shnapek, the business manager at Peninsula Doctor. “I think there’s something beautiful about that.”",voxdotcom,"['wealthy', 'cut', 'try', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'patients', 'medical', 'concierge', 'area', 'silicon', 'valley', 'bay', 'ultrawealthy', 'line', 'doctors']",0

What will happen if President Biden implements a certain anti-poverty policy? How likely is a new study to be borne out in future research? If a new Supreme Court justice is appointed, how will that change how the Court rules on key cases?

No one is perfect, and anyone who makes dozens of those predictions every month will be wrong sometimes, but getting these predictions right — and, just as important, being right about your own level of uncertainty — really matters. If policymakers could rely on accurate predictions about the outcome of a foreign war or the advisability of a budget proposal, we could make much better policy decisions.

And being good at predictions is a skill like any other — you have to practice it. University of Pennsylvania psychologist Philip Tetlock studies forecasting, holding tournaments to identify the skills that make people better than their peers at predicting future events. He finds that the most critical skills are thinking numerically, being open to changing your mind, updating your beliefs incrementally and frequently instead of in rare big moments, and — most encouragingly — practicing. The best way to get better at prediction-making is to do it all the time, note your successes, learn from your failures, and refine your understanding of where you’re strongest at making predictions.

So for the third year in a row, the staff of Future Perfect will be providing predictions on the year to come. As with last time, we assign each event a probability between 10 percent and 95 percent (Tetlock found that the best forecasters thought in terms of probabilities rather than simple yes/no predictions). To say that something has an 80 percent chance of happening doesn’t mean it’s definitely happening; it means that if we make five predictions at 80 percent confidence, we’re expecting to have four of them come true. (This kind of probabilistic thinking can trip people up, as Nate Silver has documented.)

We don’t speak for Vox, or even for each other, and we hope that where you disagree, you’ll weigh in with predictions of your own.

The United States

Trump will uneventfully leave office on January 20 (70 percent)

To be clear, there is at this point no doubt about whether Trump will leave office on January 20, the official inauguration date for the new president, Joe Biden. Biden secured more electoral votes. Trump’s campaign made a lot of noise but didn’t bring serious allegations of fraud to court, and no court would grant his proposed remedy of overturning the election. His backers have held alternate Electoral College votes and threatened the real electors, but that won’t change the outcome either.

There is likely to be some drama and potentially even violent street protests on January 6, when the Electoral College vote is read before Congress, but that, too, is nearly certain to be political theater that can’t overturn the legal election results.

The only part of this up in the air is the key word “uneventfully.” In December claims circulated that Trump has told his advisers he won’t leave. If the president has to be dragged by force out of the White House, or stages a protest to Biden’s inauguration on Inauguration Day, then I’ll be proven wrong. But my guess is that once every remedy has been exhausted, the president will retreat to Mar-a-Lago or a similar location, continuing to tweet that the election was unfair. —Kelsey Piper

Biden will have a treasury secretary, secretary of state, defense secretary, and attorney general confirmed by the end of the year (70 percent)

One of the more depressing political predictions I’ve seen floating around is that, should Republicans hold on to at least one of the two Georgia Senate seats, they will block Biden from assembling a Cabinet, and we’ll have four years of unprecedented political gridlock.

My general starting point for predicting politics is to predict that things will be bad, but not as bad as the gloomiest predictions circulating among pundits, and often mostly bad along dimensions they’re not tracking. Making it impossible for Biden to appoint a secretary of state or similar would be high-profile and divisive; I expect most gridlock to be introduced through less clear-cut strategies. Plus, there’s a chance that Democrats win both Georgia runoffs, which look like toss-ups in the polls.

Given all that, why only 70 percent? One lesson I’ve learned from doing these predictions is that the more detail they have, the more can go wrong. I would bet very confidently that Biden will have a secretary of state, or that he’ll have a defense secretary, etc. But this prediction specifies he’ll have all four, so I should be correspondingly less confident in it. —KP

At least one US state will have an abortion ban currently blocked by the courts go into effect (40 percent)

The Supreme Court, now dominated by justices who think Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, might overturn it in the next year. More likely, they might technically leave it in place but hollow it out. I consider it pretty likely that they’ll aim to reduce abortion access only a little, and that they won’t overturn Roe or take any larger steps to allow states to pass sweeping abortion bans.

That said, there’s a significant chance this year will see sweeping changes in abortion access in America. Some 10 states have so-called trigger laws on the books to immediately ban all or almost all abortions if Roe is overturned, and nine other states have laws on the books that are currently blocked under Roe. In Kentucky, for example, one such law would make it illegal to get an abortion past six weeks, even in cases of rape and child molestation, even if the fetus is not viable and will regardless not survive, and even if the pregnant person’s health would be substantially harmed, if they’re not at risk of death or permanent organ damage.

In the long run, I expect very few US states to stand by such total bans — they’re overwhelmingly unpopular with the American public, most of whom want abortion available at least under limited circumstances, especially early in a pregnancy. But they’ve made their way onto the books, protected from public scrutiny by the fact that they’re currently unconstitutional, and if the Supreme Court lets them go into effect, millions of Americans will temporarily live under deeply unpopular, extreme anti-abortion laws.

I consider this somewhat unlikely — the Supreme Court tends to prefer not to take such strong steps when it can instead advance its aims more gradually by chipping away, rather than overturning, Roe — but still likely enough that it ought to be on everyone’s radar. —KP

No one in Trump’s immediate family will be indicted (65 percent)

Let me be very clear: I am not saying that Jared Kushner and Donald, Melania, Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and the oft-forgot Tiffany Trump are innocent of any and all crimes. I’ve read a little bit on those folks and they seem a bit shady, to be honest.

What I am saying is that liberals right now are overestimating the enthusiasm that will remain for state-level investigations into the Trump family once Trump is out of office. Interest in Bush-era abuses vanished almost immediately in 2009. New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance are political actors and will notice that the voter demand for such investigations no longer exists come mid-2021. And the Biden Justice Department will likely be reticent to prosecute his predecessor, not least if Hunter Biden is still the target of legal scrutiny. —Dylan Matthews

Trump approval rating by year’s end will be in the 40 to 45 percent range (70 percent)

The president’s approval ratings have been flat throughout his term; no matter what he does, about 55 to 60 percent of the country dislikes him and 40 to 45 percent of the country likes him. An economic boom didn’t change that. A pandemic and attendant economic crash didn’t, either. His refusal to concede the election hasn’t done it. Will that change when he’s out of office?

My bet is on “no.” Most presidents experience a bump in popularity — from nostalgia — once they’re out of office, but it doesn’t seem likely to me that Trump will see such a bump, for the same reason that no other events have affected his approval ratings. Americans know how they feel about Trump, and at this point those feelings are barely responsive to anything Trump does. —KP

The US unemployment rate will stay above 5 percent through November (70 percent)

The Trump White House used to talk, back in the spring, about a “snapback” recovery: You lift social distancing restrictions, stuff goes back to normal, and the economy becomes what it was in January 2020, with unemployment at 3.6 percent and falling. I don’t see it happening.

Yes, the vaccine rollout will spur people to spend more again. But the rollout will also be gradual, and there will be tremendous uncertainty about what it’s safe for vaccinated people to do, when to stop wearing masks, when it’s okay to go on airplanes or to indoor restaurants, and so forth. All that will weaken a vaccine-driven recovery.

What’s more, Congress chose in December to pass real but inadequate stimulus measures. The $300/week bonus to unemployment insurance is good but not enough, and giving almost no aid to states and localities is ridiculous. The inadequate assistance, and lack of retroactive aid for August through December when emergency UI had expired, means there’ll be some debt overhang from people using credit cards and other kinds of loans to get by without congressional assistance. The low level of state and local aid also means hiring and purchases by state and local governments will be low, which will meaningfully hurt the recovery.

The Fed can, and should, ramp up asset buys (“quantitative easing”) and keep promising to keep interest rates low to aid the recovery, but the economy needs more drastic demand stimulus than that. With a closely divided Senate, possibly under Republican control, I don’t think that additional fiscal stimulus will be forthcoming after the December deal. The result will be a longer and more painful recovery than was necessary. —DM

US poverty will be higher in late 2021 than it was in late 2020 (80 percent)

I’ve written a lot about the rise in poverty this year since enhanced unemployment insurance (the $600 per week top-up included in the initial Covid-19 relief bill) expired at the end of July, and the projections that it will be rising more still by January. The basics are simple: The US is in a recession, the extremely generous stimulus policies of April through July were so extensive as to actually reduce poverty despite that recession, but since the federal government stopped helping things got progressively worse.

The end-of-2020 deal in Congress included a more modest, $300/week UI benefit boost and some modest direct cash payments to households, which should help reduce poverty temporarily. But I fear that the deal, which looks to expire at the end of March, will result in a similar dynamic as the 2020 stimulus: a brief improvement, followed by deterioration upon its expiration, and gridlock in Congress that prevents further progress.

To be specific, for this prediction I’ll be relying on two monthly measures of poverty: one from the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia, and one by economists Bruce Meyer, James X. Sullivan, and Jeehoon Han. —DM

The median home price in the Bay Area will fall 5 percent or more (70 percent)

For years, people have been declaring that the Bay Area — my home — is doomed, even as its housing prices and job market continued to boom. But 2020 may have really changed things. Many companies have moved out of expensive San Francisco. Many of their employees have, too. Most people agree that remote work isn’t quite as good — but it provides enormous advantages compared to having to hire in the most expensive market in the United States. I wouldn’t bet on a massive outflow from the Bay in the next year, but I think there will be a steady one, enough to continue this year’s depression in home prices and rents.

To be clear, I think this is a tragedy. With good governance, the San Francisco area could’ve risen to the moment and become a global city with affordable housing for both locals and new arrivals, demonstrating that its values create good places for people to live their lives. Instead, it demonstrated the opposite. It took Covid-19 to bring these consequences, but they were eventually going to happen. —KP

100 million Americans will be vaccinated, at least partially, against the coronavirus by end of April (70 percent)

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has predicted that the vaccine will be widely available to Americans by April. Some back-of-the-envelope math tells me there’ll be enough supply to fully vaccinate 100 million people.

Pfizer has agreed to give the US 100 million doses by the end of March; since each person has to get two doses, that’s enough to fully vaccinate 50 million. And Moderna says it’ll have 85 million to 100 million doses ready for Americans in the first quarter, providing full inoculation for perhaps another 50 million. Some other vaccines, such as AstraZeneca’s, may also start rolling in.

That said, it’s not enough for the US to have lots of vaccine doses on hand; it also has to distribute the doses efficiently. Distribution has been frustratingly slow in December and the early days of January, placing the country far behind its initial target. So I’m not highly confident that the US will manage to get two shots each to 100 million people by end of April.

However, I do think there’s a significant likelihood of getting at least one shot to that many people within that timeframe. Fauci says vaccination rates may accelerate soon, and he thinks the country can hit a target of 1 million shots per day. That rate would make Biden’s stated goal — distributing 100 million shots in his first 100 days as president — achievable. —SS

Restaurant reservations and consumer spending outside the home back to normal by the end of year (70 percent)

With the vaccine for the novel coronavirus widely available by next summer, I predict that the lockdown will extend longer than we’d like but certainly not through the next year. I expect that by the fall, consumer spending will be back to normal — plausibly even boosted by pent-up demand. I’ll look at this page of government statistics to see if I got this one right. —KP

The world

A deadly new zoonotic outbreak will emerge (55 percent)

I know, I know, everyone is going to hate me for saying this. And to be clear, I’m not saying we’ll see an outbreak that rises to the level of a pandemic like Covid-19, which reached into pretty much every corner of the planet. But I do think we may see the emergence of a disease that starts in animals, spills over into humans, and causes at least a few dozen deaths.

Why do I think this? As Martha Nelson, who studies viruses at the National Institutes of Health, told us on the Future Perfect podcast, we’re “playing Russian roulette” with animals. Our environmental practices (like cutting down forests and destroying other animal habitats) and our factory farming system (where pigs, chickens, cows, and more are crowded together in unsanitary conditions) make zoonotic outbreaks increasingly likely.

No less than 75 percent of new diseases originate in animals, and they’ve been popping up with alarming frequency in recent years. H5N1 came from birds in 1997. H1N1 came from pigs in 2009. Ebola spread from bats in 2014. There’s also Zika, and West Nile, and several others. I’m afraid we’ll see a new killer zoonotic disease in 2021. I hope I’m wrong. —SS

The US will enact policies to hold China accountable for its treatment of Muslims, but the internment camps will remain open (80 percent)

In 2020, the Biden campaign referred to China’s repression of Uighur Muslims as “genocide.” In 2021, I have no doubt that Biden will repeatedly condemn the camps where more than 1 million of them have been held. I am also fairly confident that the US will pass at least one significant bill aimed at holding China accountable, especially given that Uighur forced labor has leached into the supply chain of American companies.

But I see no reason to think that China will shut down the camps in 2021. The government there has already proven that targeted sanctions do not have swaying power; although the US imposed sanctions on officials like Xinjiang’s Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, the camp system persists.

Getting China to shut down the system would require much bigger incentives — financial as well as reputational. But China is simply so economically powerful that it’s hard to imagine the US being willing to hit it too hard financially. And the world is struggling to even get the reputational piece of the puzzle in place; the International Criminal Court recently decided not to investigate China’s repression of the Uighurs. —SS

The Hadi government and Houthi rebels in Yemen reach a peace agreement (60 percent)

This bet is motivated by a few developments that together make me think 2021 could be the year the devastating conflict in Yemen that has already killed more than 100,000 people comes to an end — or, at the very least, the year that a temporary ceasefire begins as peace talks get underway. My specific prediction is that there will be either a formal peace deal between the Saudi-backed Hadi government and the Iranian-backed Houthis or else a tentative ceasefire. The latter sadly seems more likely.

The biggest development is Joe Biden’s election. The US is not the main actor in the civil war, but it is an important actor for the support it has given Saudi Arabia (including actual special forces troops on the ground). Bipartisan pressure from Congress to end support for the Saudi air war has been mounting throughout Trump’s term, and a president less close to Saudi de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman seems likelier to yield to that pressure.

The Biden campaign in fact promised to end support for the Saudis in Yemen, and incoming senior administration officials — Secretary of State-designate Antony Blinken, Director of National Intelligence-designate Avril Haines, National Security Adviser-designate Jake Sullivan, and UN Ambassador-designate Linda Thomas-Greenfield — signed an open letter urging the same.

At the same time, Biden and his team are eager to have the US rejoin the multilateral nuclear deal with Iran and to more broadly reverse the Trump administration’s efforts to antagonize the country and reverse all diplomatic progress made under Obama. Iran is understandably hesitant to just let the US ping-pong in and out of agreements from election to election, and so withdrawing from Yemen and working to broker a peace between Iran’s proxies and Saudi Arabia’s would be an important show of good faith on the US’s part.

Beyond Biden, though, there have been encouraging signs on the ground in Yemen. Saudi Arabia recently signaled openness to a ceasefire (albeit on terms the Houthis may not accept), and unilaterally called a brief ceasefire in April. There was a large-scale prisoner swap in September. On their own, these are not grounds for unbridled optimism, but they suggest that an engaged and motivated US administration, newly distanced from Saudi Arabia, could help force a truce. —DM

LDP continues to govern Japan (90 percent), CDU continues to govern Germany (80 percent)

I’m grouping these together on the somewhat tenuous grounds that I’m predicting each major former Axis power will continue to be governed by the center-right party that has dominated its politics since shortly after World War II (this pattern has not held in Italy because nothing about Italian politics makes any sense).

The Liberal Democratic Party’s grip on Japan and the Christian Democratic Union’s grip on Germany are not absolute. Japan has had brief periods of non-LDP rule, such as when the opposition Democratic Party held office from 2009 to 2012, but they have tended to be short-lived, and the opposition to the LDP is prone to factionalism and infighting. Polling suggests the party and new Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide don’t face any serious opposition in 2021. It doesn’t hurt that the country has weathered Covid-19 exceptionally well.

Similarly, the German Social Democratic Party (SDP) has been able to form cabinets: Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt’s governments in West Germany from 1969 to 1982, and Gerhard Schroeder’s from 1998 to 2005. But in the 15-year regime of Angela Merkel, the SDP has usually been the junior coalition partner to the Christian Democrats and is in danger of losing its status as the dominant center-left party in the country to the Greens. As it stands, though, the Greens are a distant second to CDU by some 15 to 20 points. The real question is who, exactly, a CDU win would make prime minister, as Merkel is retiring after the election and the CDU leadership race continues. —DM

India’s economy will grow in quarters 1-3 of 2021 after shrinking briefly in 2020 (70 percent)

One of the greatest tragedies of the Covid-19 crisis is that it forced low-income countries to choose between halting years and years of progress against poverty, and allowing a massive public health catastrophe to unfold. India opted for mandatory activity restrictions in certain areas perceived as at risk of Covid-19 outbreaks in the spring, and the predictable result of that and the global economic contraction was a recession, the first since 1980. India reversed course and reopened quite quickly, and is now up to over 10 million cases (second only to, well, the US).

If the public health situation deteriorates further and necessitates more lockdowns, the recession could drag out. But as it stands, the situation seems to be improving. From July to September, the economy shrank by 7.5 percent year over year compared to a shocking 24 percent contraction in April through June. That gives me hope that in the new year, the economy will be growing again.

India releases its GDP numbers in a fiscal year schedule where April through June was “quarter 1” of the “2020-2021 fiscal year,” so to be specific, what I’m predicting is that India’s GDP will grow in both nominal and real terms in quarter 4 of the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and quarters 1 and 2 of the 2021-2022 fiscal year. —DM

At least three new basic income pilots will be launched (75 percent)

Covid-19 boosted public support for the idea of a basic income. As the pandemic unexpectedly wiped out millions of people’s finances through no fault of their own, advocates argued that citizens desperately need some sort of guaranteed payment to fall back on. Some governments and philanthropists listened. Spain started offering payments of up to 1,015 euros ($1,145) to the poorest families in the country. Germany started a new basic income experiment. And in the US, a coalition of mayors — with a $15 million grant from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey — launched guaranteed income pilots in several US cities.

I think basic income will continue to gain momentum in 2021, with at least three new pilots launching globally. I’m not expecting to see much action at the national level — with a few exceptions, basic income programs offer money to small groups of a few hundred or few thousand people, not a whole country — but I think we’ll see a good amount of action at the city level. That’s because the global economy won’t recover overnight; the need precipitated by the pandemic will persist well into the year, and the illusion that only lazy people ever need “free money” has been shattered. —SS

No more countries will leave the EU (80 percent)

After Brexit (remember when Brexit was the biggest story in the world?), there was widespread speculation that Britain’s departure foretold the end of the EU. That hasn’t been borne out, and I don’t expect this next year to change that. Why not? First, Britain’s departure from the EU has embarrassed its two major political parties, damaged its economy, and infuriated its citizens — not exactly an inspiring model. Second, Britain was unusual anyway: Most countries in the EU plainly gain a lot from being there, and have more of a cultural identity as part of Europe. And there are no mainstream political movements for withdrawal. —KP

Technology and environment

An AI breakthrough will lead to a game-changing advance in biology (75 percent)

In 2020, a couple of amazing AI breakthroughs rocked the biology world. First, researchers trained a neural network to predict which molecules (out of 107 million possibilities!) would have antibacterial properties, enabling them to identify brand new types of antibiotics. Then, DeepMind’s AlphaFold system cracked the “protein folding problem,” a grand challenge of biology that had vexed scientists for 50 years. That’ll likely speed up and improve scientists’ ability to develop new drugs.

The AI field is moving at such a fast clip that I think we’ll see at least one breakthrough of this magnitude in 2021. I’m talking about something that pushes biology forward by a significant margin. —SS

Global carbon emissions will increase (90 percent)

This is a perennial prediction, one of those that is mostly true every year. Global carbon emissions keep rising because the world economy is growing faster than it’s shifting to non-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy sources. Last year, global carbon emissions fell, but that was caused by the near-total shutdown of the global economy, which won’t be sustained in 2021. In fact, I’m even more confident than usual that we’ll see carbon emissions grow, because they will increase from 2020’s lower baseline. —KP

Average world temperatures will increase relative to 2020 (80 percent)

Average world temperatures have increased most years for the past several decades, though there’s a little bit of noise, so any given year isn’t a sure thing. This is a direct consequence of increased carbon emissions, but with some lag — I don’t expect last year’s small decrease in CO2 to produce a decline in average global temperatures, but just a slightly slower rate of increase. —KP

Plant-based meat market share will increase by at least 20 percent (80 percent)

In the past few years, we’ve seen the takeoff of plant-based meat products — foods designed to have the taste and nutrient content of meat without the environmental, health, and animal welfare costs of factory farming. Plant-based meat is only a tiny fraction of overall animal meat sales, but it’s grown dramatically in the past few years.

Even if that growth slows, it should comfortably top 20 percent from the previous year. The return of restaurant dining is likely to help the plant-based meat market, too — while the products are available in supermarkets and have done well there, they got their start in restaurants, where it’s easier to convince consumers to try something new and unfamiliar. I’ll measure this by getting data on sales of refrigerated plant-based meat products from the Good Food Institute — meaning this prediction, if it’s close, might not be settled until the following March, when all its data for the year is in (unless preliminary data can tell us enough). —KP",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'trump', 'biden', 'im', 'presidency', 'covid19', '2021', 'think', 'end', 'good', 'million', 'predictions']",0
2021-01-01 14:16:25+00:00,20,"A new, seemingly more contagious variety of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — that has been spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom has now been found in the United States in at least two locations.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced December 30 that the new strain, known as B.1.1.7 (we’ll call it the UK variant, for simplicity’s sake), was detected in the southern part of the state. It’s the second report of the UK variant in the US in as many days, following news that the variant was found in a male Colorado National Guard member in his 20s with no history of travel, a sign that the virus is spreading locally.

“There is a lot we don’t know about this COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement.

The evidence that this new strain spreads more easily between people is not rock solid, but it’s concerning enough to have forced dramatic action, like shutting down travel from the United Kingdom earlier this month. But it wasn’t enough: The variant has now been detected in Canada, Spain, Sweden, France, and Italy, among others.

At the moment, it doesn’t appear as though the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 is more dangerous in individuals. It doesn’t seem to make people sicker, nor is it more likely to kill them. “I think the key point is that there is no evidence now … that this virus is more pathogenic — creates more problems, more morbidity and mortality — than the previous virus,” Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, said during a December 21 press conference.

What it does appear to do, at least based on preliminary evidence, is spread more quickly among people. That alone is a problem: The coronavirus spreads fast enough as it is. Compounding concerns is that the UK variant echoes a similar story in South Africa, where a strain called 501.V2 has become the dominant version among new cases of the virus. Scientists are wondering whether that strain is more transmissible, too.

The virus has been continually changing its genetics through the course of the pandemic. That’s what RNA-based viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do — they mutate. Most of the time, the mutations mean nothing. But this time, something is different.

“I’ve spent a lot of time this year reminding people that mutations are normal,” molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, who works on a project called Nextstrain, said. For the entire pandemic, scientists around the world have been collecting genetic information about SARS-CoV-2 in a public database called GISAID. Hodcroft and her colleagues at Nextstrain draw on this database to closely track genetic changes in the virus.

In the past, mutations haven’t warranted big newspaper headlines. “I’m now finding myself singing a slightly different tune,” Hodcroft said. This time, there does seem to be evidence that the new strain is something worth being vigilant about. “We probably should consider taking some precautionary measures while we’re trying to find out more,” she added.

At the same time, Covid-19 is surging around the world, even without these new mutations. Scientists are still trying to figure out what these new variants of the coronavirus actually mean for the pandemic. It’s also unclear where else the UK variant may have already spread, aside from the countries where it has been detected. While it was reported in the US only this week, it could have been in the country for much longer. “The variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported December 22.

The good news is that we already know how to respond to these new variants: in the same way we’ve been responding to the pandemic overall. The virus still transmits primarily through viral-laden breaths in the air. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and good indoor ventilation are as critical as ever.

There’s a lot about this story that’s potentially very alarming or confusing. And the story is not yet complete, as scientists need more evidence to understand whether these new variants pose a new threat.

To add some clarity, here’s what researchers have learned so far. Let’s start with the basics.

Viral mutations, explained

Viral mutations. New strains. Increased transmission. It all sounds like scary science fiction. But to demystify things, and to understand why scientists are a little concerned about this new variant — and why most variants don’t faze them — it’s worth understanding how viruses mutate in the first place.

“Oftentimes, I think the word mutation in general conjures up a lot of things in people’s minds, like, you know, Ninja Turtles or X-Men or cancer, like zombie apocalypse-type stuff,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said. “A mutation is just a lot more mundane than that.”

Viruses mutate because they’re constantly making copies of themselves in enormous numbers. To accomplish this, they have to hijack the hardware of a host cell that they infect. However, this process can be a bit sloppy.

Within a human body, a virus can replicate itself millions or billions of times, Hodcroft explains. If you were writing a draft of something millions of times on a computer, extremely quickly, you’d probably make some typos. That’s what’s happening with the viruses. “They make a typo” in their genetic code, she says. One letter of their ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain is replaced with another.

Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, like SARS-CoV-2, are particularly vulnerable to mutations since the RNA molecule itself is more unstable than DNA. The process of copying RNA is also more prone to error.

These typos can be very useful for scientists because they happen at a regular rate, and are passed down through generations of the virus as it spreads through a community. Often, scientists can use these subtle changes to trace certain strains’ lineage and their spread through a population.

The majority of these typos are inconsequential when it comes to human health. “One typo, or even a few typos, doesn’t usually change how the virus works,” Hodcroft says. Some even harm the virus. “You’re much more likely to break it than to make it better” when it comes to mutations, she says.

But in rare instances, some mutations can give a virus an advantage, like allowing it to infect cells more readily or spread among people faster. Those mutant strains can then become dominant within a population.

That might be what we’re looking at here with the UK variant; this new strain may have accumulated typos that could make it more easily transmitted between people.

Four lines of evidence converging on this new mutation being more transmissible

So why do scientists think this variant is more transmissible?

They don’t have this nailed down yet for sure, but four converging streams of evidence are all pointing in the same direction. “That’s making people feel like maybe there is something here to be worried about,” Hodcroft says. “Each one of these things on their own, I would say is not necessarily convincing.” But all together, they paint a concerning picture.

One is that in the areas of the UK where this new variant is spreading, it is accounting for a larger proportion of new cases. “What this implies is that this new variant is spreading better than other variants that are circulating in the same region,” she says.

National testing data shows increased prevalence of the variant in positive cases over time. This is detected incidentally by the commonly used 3-gene PCR test because 69-70del leads to a negative signal. But this does not effect the results of the test. 7/

A second is that the increase didn’t co-occur with any overly obvious change in human behavior. “We don’t really have strong evidence that everyone in the southeast [UK where this variant is spreading] has just ripped their masks off and is, you know, totally violating restrictions,” she says. That said, it could be a coincidence. It could be just that people who happen to have contracted this variant have it are spreading it more often via their behavior.

After all, “this new variant has emerged at a time of the year when there has traditionally been increased family and social mixing,” according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which estimated that the transmissibility of the new variant has increased by 70 percent compared to prior versions of the virus. Both Rasmussen and Hodcroft say the 70 percent more transmissible figure is most likely an overestimate. A recent, not yet peer-reviewed study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine used a mathematical model to estimate that the new strain may be 56 percent more infectious.

Third, there’s some early data about how this variant acts in Covid-19 patients. “There may be slightly higher viral loads in patients with the variants,” Hodcroft says, suggesting the virus has an easier time replicating in the body. (Viral load refers to the amount of virus in the patient. Rasmussen also cautions that viral load data is really sensitive to timing and when the patient was sampled in the course of the illness, so there needs to be more data to confirm this.)

Finally, the genetic changes in the UK variant mirror changes in the South African variant, which has also been associated with rising case numbers. That makes a plausible link: that this particular genetic change may be behind the increased transmissibility in both variants.

However, this is still short of definitive confirmation that the new variant is more transmissible.

According to Slaoui, figuring this out for certain would require laboratory animal testing to see how easily the virus can spread from one organism to another. But this testing can take several weeks.

In the face of that uncertainty, many urge caution.

Again, there’s still no evidence this new variant causes more severe disease. The evidence points only to increased transmissibility. But a more transmissible virus is still a concern. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Hodcroft says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

What does the mutation ... do?

The UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 actually contains 23 mutations in the genome of the virus. “We don’t really know what they do,” Rasmussen says. Individually, many of these mutations have already been seen in other strains of the virus around the world. But the combination of these changes in a single virus could be making the new variant more likely to spread.

However, scientists do think that some mutations may be more important than others, and there are several mechanisms by which mutations could make the virus more infectious. Those include:

1. The virus could end up with changes to its spike protein that allow it to enter cells more easily.

2. The virus could develop a mechanism to replicate more quickly inside a body, which would lead “to people becoming infectious faster, or contagious faster than they would with another variant,” Rasmussen explains.

3. The virus could theoretically have evolved an ability to counteract the cell’s innate immune defenses, making it easier to infect that cell.

One of the pathways scientists suspect may be at work stems from the N501Y mutation, where the amino acid asparagine is replaced by the amino acid tyrosine in the 501st position of the viral protein sequence. It’s one of several mutations in the virus’s spike protein in the UK variant, but N501Y is in the part of the spike that actually comes into direct contact with human cells. The same mutation has been found in the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 that’s also quickly spreading.

Since the virus attaching to a host cell is critical to the virus’s reproduction, the virus’s spike protein is especially important — and delicate.

“If you were just making random changes in the lab, almost any change you make in that area would result in just a dead virus that can no longer get into the cell,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University Texarkana. “That fact that this thing is able to spread at all tells you that it’s at least as good as the original version. The fact that it’s spreading faster may indicate that it’s a little bit better at grabbing on to host cells, which is the first step of the entry process.”

But this particular N501Y mutation has already been detected in strains that have risen and fallen in other parts of the world over the course of the pandemic. So it may be that the other mutations coupled with N501Y are having some sort of compounding effect. And scientists still need to do more work to determine if this is actually what’s causing the rise of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Finding out the answer could help researchers come up with ways to counter this variety of the coronavirus.

How did these coronavirus mutations happen?

Scientists don’t know exactly how the UK variant came to be. But there may be a clue. Hodcroft is struck by the sheer number of mutations in the UK variant — 23 in all — which makes her suspect it’s possible this variant arose in an immunocompromised person. “It’s an above-average number of mutations,” she says.

In most people, she explains, the immune system mounts a full-on assault on the virus, eliminating it in a matter of a couple of weeks. “In people that have compromised immune systems, though, there’s a very different dynamic,” she says. “So, for one thing, the virus could be in them for months instead of weeks.” That gives the virus more time to evolve, to accumulate mutations that might make it easier to thwart the immune system.

“It’s one scenario,” she says. “We may never know exactly what happened here.”

The basic truth: The more this virus spreads, the more chances there are for dangerous new variants to emerge. In any person — or animal, for that matter — the chance for a dangerous new variant to arise is rare. But rare things can happen when there are so many cases: more than 80 million confirmed cases worldwide.

Since viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are mutating and since Covid-19 has spread in so many people, it’s theoretically only a matter of time before a certain set of mutations align in a way to give the virus a boost.

What can we do about Covid-19 mutants?

To stop mutations, quite simply, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Rasmussen says. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

We fight the new variant as we would any variant of SARS-CoV-2: with masks, with social distancing, with good hand hygiene. “I don’t think people should be panicking,” Hodcroft says. “Lower case numbers, no matter what the variant, are better.”

It’s already been said but if we actually follow protocol and have policies that support those protocols a new variant that is more transmissible would be combatted just as an older variant. So like worry less about mutants and more about masking and distancing and vaccination. — K. Taylor, Ph.D., M.S. (@KYT_ThatsME) December 21, 2020

Scientists have one more tool, though: genetic tracking. At Nextstrain, Hodcroft and her colleagues receive viral genetic sequences from all over the world to try to paint a real-time picture of transmission chains and keep tabs on how the virus is changing. But not every place in the world is providing the same amount of data.

The UK does a lot of viral sequencing, for instance. It was able to pick up on the new viral strain quickly because of that. In other locations around the globe, that might not have happened so fast.

“In the US, it’s a really spotty picture,” Hodcroft says when it comes to sequencing. “Some states have really invested in sequencing; some states haven’t. So for some states, we probably have a fair idea of what’s going on. In other states, we really don’t have many sequences.”

Overall, the CDC reports that the US has sequenced only 51,000 of the more than 17 million cases reported in the country. That’s 0.07 percent. In comparison, the UK aims to sequence 10,000 virus samples per week, and plans to increase that capacity further. (In addition: The UK sequences the genomes faster than the US, according to infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford.) That lack of viral genetic testing creates a big blind spot in the US. The UK variant could have already arrived here undetected “given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced,” the CDC states.

More sequencing, overall, would lead to the faster detection of new strains and faster means to contain them if they were deemed problematic.

Do mutations mean a Covid-19 vaccine won’t work anymore?

With new mutations, there is a concern that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 could arise that would be different enough from previous versions such that prior exposures — whether through a vaccine or an infection — won’t offer protection. So, yes, it’s possible that the coronavirus could someday mutate in a way that would elude a vaccine or previous immunity.

Right now, though, scientists think this UK variant would still fall under the same umbrella of protection as earlier strains. If someone received a Covid-19 vaccine for an older generation of the virus, they would likely have protection against this one.

To explain why, it helps to understand how the immune system deals with viruses. When the human body detects a hostile foreign entity like a virus, it starts to produce antibodies (proteins that attach to the virus or to infected cells). Antibodies can then interfere with how the virus works. They can also flag the virus or virus-infected cells for destruction by other immune cells.

The specific places where the antibodies attach to the virus are called epitopes, and most Covid-19 vaccines target epitopes on the virus’s spike protein (which is what the virus uses to attach to human cells and enter them).

“The good thing with the vaccine is that it induces an immune response against several epitopes that have been mapped around the spike protein,” Slaoui said. “The chances that one set of mutations would alter all those epitopes, I think, are extremely very low. The expectation, scientifically, is that these kinds of variations are unlikely to escape fully the protective response by the vaccine.”

More good news: Scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch have announced (via a tweet) preliminary evidence that antibodies that neutralize the more common strain of the virus also neutralize a strain with the N501Y mutation (the one that impacts the part of the virus that comes into direct contact with human cells, as mentioned above). That suggests that an immune system primed — by a natural infection, at least — to fight the old variant can also fight one with this specific mutation.

Some good news (and incredibly fast work) on one of the mutations scientists are worried about: N501Y.

In these lab experiments serum from recovered #covid19 patients was just as good at neutralizing virus with the mutation as without it. https://t.co/SIxfo2x3qp — Kai Kupferschmidt (@kakape) December 22, 2020

Texas A&M’s Neuman noted that there’s also evidence right now showing how well vaccines can protect against mutated forms of the virus in clinical trials. Many of the vaccines being administered were engineered to counter the earliest generations of SARS-CoV-2 but are still showing themselves to be highly effective against Covid-19 caused by more recent versions of the virus.

“All the tests are being done, all the papers being published, are being done with current strains, which have several mutations relative to [the first iterations of the virus], and it does still seem to be working,” Neuman said.

Covid-19 vaccine developers say they are keeping a close eye on these changes and testing to make sure their vaccines are still effective. “In terms of the new variant, Pfizer and BioNTech are monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequence changes and the companies are working to generate data on how well serum from people immunized with [the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine] may be able to neutralize the new strain,” said a Pfizer spokesperson via email.

And the new Covid-19 vaccines are well equipped to adapt. The two that have received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration — the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine — both use mRNA as their platform. These vaccines deliver the instructions for making the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Those human cells then manufacture the component themselves, allowing the immune system to use it to prepare for an infection. One huge advantage of this approach is that the mRNA sequence can be altered quickly; the first such vaccines for Covid-19 were developed within days after the genetic sequence of the virus was posted online.

Could manufacturers like Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech then retool their vaccines to target the new variants without going through the whole tedious clinical trial process again?

Possibly, according to Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA and a professor of medicine at Georgetown University. He told Vox that vaccines for new variants of the influenza virus are approved every year without large-scale trials. New versions of a Covid-19 vaccine to accommodate mutations similarly might not need another round of study in tens of thousands of people, but may require some testing to figure out dosing and immune response. With such a new virus and brand new vaccines, the regulations for these situations have not yet been laid out.

Should we expect more mutations in the future?

Short answer: yes.

The UK and South African variants are unlikely to be the last to make headlines. Coronavirus is constantly evolving. We should expect it to keep changing slightly.

“There will be new variants that emerge,” Rasmussen says. The thing is, with each new significant strain, scientists will have to do careful work to determine whether it’s more dangerous.

And there are some mutations we can perhaps even expect — if not in the coming weeks, over the next several years.

Recently, virology researchers at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center published a preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) study, looking at how a coronavirus that causes the common cold evolved from the 1980s onward. To accomplish that, they got old blood samples, which included antibodies that cling to this particular virus. They also reconstructed pieces of the cold virus from other eras. Basically, they wanted to see if older blood could still neutralize newer virus. If it couldn’t, that would indicate the virus has evolved over time to evade the immune system.

Here’s what the researchers found: “This other human coronavirus does indeed evolve over the course of multiple years to gradually escape human immunity,” Jesse Bloom, a virologist who co-authored the study, says. “So we think this suggests that there’s the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to do the same thing.” But Bloom stresses that this process takes years. It’s enough time to prepare, to monitor, and to potentially tweak vaccine formulations to keep up with the virus’s evolution.

It’s not like the virus can evolve into an entirely different beast. “It can mutate to maybe escape antibodies,” Rachel Eguia, the study’s lead author, says. But it can’t change so much that it alters its ability to enter cells.

Scientists are also keeping their eyes out for a rapid, major mutation event known as recombination. That’s where an individual is infected with two different strains of the virus at the same time, allowing the virus strains to swap parts. These new viruses could then evade the antibodies that targeted their predecessors. Some researchers think that recombination might be how SARS-CoV-2 originated in the first place.

“This is all hypothetical in this particular virus, but it happens in other viruses all the time,” Neuman said.

Faced with these looming challenges, reducing the transmission of the coronavirus in general is still the best way to protect the fragile progress made in the Covid-19 pandemic so far. Reducing transmissions is also one of the best ways to make sure powerful tools like vaccines remain potent for as long as possible. The fact that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are coming out is not a cause for complacency, and these new variants of SARS-CoV-2 highlight how important it is to remain vigilant.

2021-01-01 13:18:15+00:00,14,"Two highly effective Covid-19 vaccines are now being administered across the United States, and more are in the pipeline. Almost 2 million people have already received the first of two doses of these vaccines, and officials are aiming to immunize one-third of the US population by the end of March 2021.

It’s a stunning accomplishment for a disease that was barely known to the world a year ago, and it means that an end to the crisis is in sight. Yet the US remains in the worst throes of the pandemic to date, with hospitalizations and deaths continuing to break records.

Vaccines are critical in drawing down the pandemic as we know it, but it won’t be a simple return to the world before Covid-19. It will likely be a process that lasts several months, and precautions like social distancing and wearing masks will still be needed until there is widespread immunity to the virus.

“It’s a bit of a glide path in my mind toward a new normal, and a new normal that will continue to get better and better,” said Ashish Jha, dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University. “Ultimately, the mental model that I’m going for is ‘When are people going about their day and not thinking about Covid?’”

Exactly when and how this will happen hinges on several key variables relating to vaccines that scientists and health officials are still trying to sort out.

The vaccines being administered right now — the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — have only received emergency use authorizations, not full approval, from the Food and Drug Administration. Regulators have determined that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks for most adults at high risk of exposure, but there are still some unanswered questions, such as how long protection lasts and how well these vaccines block transmission of the virus between people.

And beyond the vaccines themselves, how quickly and how readily people accept them can change the course of the pandemic.

How well a Covid-19 vaccine contains the pandemic depends on the answers to several key questions

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines are still ongoing, and more clarity will emerge in the coming months. But for now, these remain some of the most important unknowns.

How well do vaccines prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2?

Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reported efficacies of roughly 95 percent against Covid-19 disease, meaning they protected the vast majority of recipients from getting sick enough to have disease symptoms, like loss of smell, fever, and cough.

However, Covid-19 is caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, that some people can carry and transmit without having any symptoms at all — whether or not they eventually end up feeling ill.

Finding the people who are carrying the virus (and preventing them from infecting others) is therefore critical to control the spread of the virus, but has proven to be a persistent obstacle during the pandemic. Currently, the main way to identify the infected is by proactively testing for the virus and, ideally, tracing who else they encountered. It’s a tedious, time-consuming process.

This is also true in vaccine clinical trials. Phase 3 trials mainly look at how well vaccines prevent disease in the real world, something that’s readily apparent when comparing the number of disease events in the vaccine group to the placebo group. It only takes 150 events or so to yield results on how well the vaccine prevents disease.

But to gauge efficacy against preventing infections, including low-grade infections that don’t generate symptoms, researchers will have to test the tens of thousands of participants in their phase 3 trial. It’s likely that a Covid-19 vaccine would reduce transmission, but it’s not clear yet by how much.

“What we know is that we’ve been seeing studies focusing specifically on efficacy with regards to severity of disease, meaning ameliorating the severity of the disease itself, but there’s still no studies that really are going to help us understand how we can certainly interrupt transmission,” said Maria Elena Bottazzi, a co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.

The companies conducting trials do plan to test their participants to see if there were any hidden infections, but it may be a while before they report their results.

That said, Moderna presented some early data showing that its vaccine does begin to reduce infections between its doses, which are spaced 28 days apart.

“There were approximately 2/3 fewer swabs that were positive in the vaccine group as compared to the placebo group at the pre-dose 2 timepoint, suggesting that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose,” according to Moderna’s report to the FDA. However, these results are preliminary and will require follow-up testing to see if this effect lasts longer than a few weeks.

The more that a vaccine can reduce the virus’s transmission, the more quickly a population can move toward herd immunity, the point where the virus can no longer spread easily between people. Scientists estimate that herd immunity threshold is when roughly between 60 percent and 90 percent of a population is immune to this virus, whether through a vaccine or from natural exposure. (A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that health workers in the United Kingdom exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced protective antibodies against the virus and were protected against reinfection for at least six months.)

But vaccines might not protect every single person who gets a shot from getting infected, just like they don’t provide a 100 percent guarantee against getting sick. That means even the vaccinated will still have to wear face masks and keep their distance from others to prevent virus transmission until immunity is widespread.

How long do vaccines protect against Covid-19?

The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech trials have shown that their vaccines start to provide protection against Covid-19 illness quickly — and that protection starts building up right after the first dose.

Whether that protection fades after a few months or a few years is unclear. And researchers can only find out by waiting and observing. That means monitoring the thousands of participants of clinical trials, as well as recipients of the vaccines in the general population, for years. Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as Moderna, have committed to actively monitoring the participants in their clinical trials for at least two years. They are also keeping an eye on people who are receiving their vaccines.

But hints on the durability of vaccine protection could arrive sooner. Looking at vaccine recipients six months or one year after they receive their injections, researchers should be able to see how many were infected with SARS-CoV-2 — and when — to get an early estimate of how quickly protection weakens.

“That would give us potentially some information for what future years will look like,” said Meagan Fitzpatrick, an assistant professor at the center for vaccine development and global health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “You will definitely get some signal, but you don’t know really for sure in a way that’s backed up by data until that amount of time passes from when the first people got their first doses.”

Longer protection would buy time for the health sector as vaccines roll out since they wouldn’t have to worry about reinfections or revaccinating people. Evidence from past coronavirus outbreaks like SARS and MERS showed that among survivors, protection for those diseases lasted for several years. But SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and much remains uncertain.

There’s also a chance that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate in a way that would escape the protection offered by a vaccine. However, scientists say that’s unlikely in the near term because Covid-19 vaccines target several different parts of the virus and the odds of simultaneous mutations in all of those regions are low.

But more study is needed to yield more definite answers, and the best way to reduce the likelihood of major mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its spread.

How quickly can we get the vaccine to everyone?

The United States is now in the midst of its largest vaccination campaign in history, an endeavor that’s anywhere from three to four times as big as vaccinating against seasonal flu, according to Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Operation Warp Speed vaccine program.

It’s a delicate and critical process. “How soon can we really start driving our Covid numbers low really definitely depends on rollout,” Fitzpatrick said. “A vaccine is only as good as the doses that actually get into people.”

However, the debut of Covid-19 vaccines has already hit several bumps. Some states have reported that their initial allotments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were cut, while the manufacturer reported that many doses have gone unclaimed.

Part of the challenge is technical constraints of the vaccines themselves. Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines require maintaining cold temperatures from factories to transportation to clinics. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in particular demands ultra-cold storage at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).

Another complicating factor is simply sorting out who should get the vaccines and when. Enough doses are not immediately available for everyone, so health officials have to make delicate decisions about who to prioritize.

The vaccines available so far have to be administered as two doses spaced several weeks apart, so everyone will have to come back for a second shot. Doses have to be set aside for follow-ups and if people don’t get their second dose, they may have protection that’s less robust or less durable than expected. In a large enough population, that could erode the power of a vaccine to contain the virus.

At the same time, health officials will have to overcome vaccine hesitancy. Getting a high uptake of vaccines is critical in drawing down pandemic restrictions. And the more holdouts there are, the longer it will take. The good news is that reluctance to getting a vaccine seems to have diminished in the United States. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 71 percent of Americans said they would likely get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 63 percent in September.

A vaccine is not just about protecting individuals, but protecting a population as a whole. With enough people immunized, even people who haven’t received the vaccine — including those who can’t get vaccinated for health reasons — will experience a much lower risk of infection.

“If you really, really, really want to interrupt and really get rid of this pandemic, you really need high levels of [vaccine] coverage and very high levels of efficacy,” Bottazzi said.

And over the coming months, more Covid-19 vaccines will likely gain approval. That will help ease some of the supply constraints, but will add to the complexity of administering them. Each vaccine has its own storage requirements, dosing schedule, and may be best suited for different demographics.

Taken together, there’s a lot that can go wrong with distributing vaccines. But getting these steps right would mean a much faster route out of the Covid-19 crisis.

How well will the US control the spread of the virus?

In addition to vaccinating millions of people, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical. Efforts to contain the virus will allow the vaccine to have a much greater impact. Vaccines could be targeted to hot spots, for instance, rather than having to push back against a national onslaught.

As mentioned earlier, curtailing the virus’s transmission also reduces the likelihood of a mutation that could render a vaccine less effective. (But if virus variants discovered in the UK that appear more transmissive spread widely in the US, that could complicate efforts of curbing spread, even if the vaccine is just as effective against these variants.)

If all goes fairly well with the logistics of vaccine distribution, it will take weeks to months for it to actually start reducing hospitalizations and fatalities from Covid-19.

A vaccine is meant to prevent illness, so it will do little for people who are already ill with Covid-19. And the SARS-CoV-2 virus can incubate in a person for up to two weeks before the individual starts to show symptoms, and it can take longer after that for them to seek treatment.

As such, there will be a lag in seeing the impacts of a vaccine across the population. But slowing the spread of the virus would make vaccines a more powerful tool to end the pandemic, and results would start to manifest much sooner. Vaccination is also going to be working in tandem with immunity people have built up from surviving infection. Almost 20 million people in the US have been infected to date. “Around 30 percent population immunity, things start slowing a little bit, especially in the places that have been hit hard,” Jha said.

Conversely, if Covid-19 continues to rage out of control, it will be much harder for a vaccine to make a difference in morbidity and mortality, and it will take even longer to see results.

We still need testing, masking, distancing, and treatments

While scientists and health experts have been elated at the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, they’ve also been adamant that vaccines on their own are not enough to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

The existing measures for slowing Covid-19 remain just as important as they’ve ever been, if not more so, given that hospitalizations and daily deaths are continuing to mount. Tactics like wearing face masks, rigorous hand-washing, and avoiding large gatherings and close contact with others will still be needed in the coming months, even among people who have been immunized.

Treatments for Covid-19 are also critical since they are the most immediate way to reduce fatalities. Approaches like monoclonal antibodies will be needed to help people survive the illness.

Widespread testing for Covid-19 will also continue to be crucial to identify potential spreaders and to allow people in key jobs to continue working.

It’s a sliding scale between these variables. For example, better testing and tracing could allow people more freedom even if they are not immune. Or effective treatments can drastically reduce fatality rates, reducing the burden of the disease.

However, pressure on all fronts — vaccines, treatment, testing, social distancing — is what will end the crisis the soonest. “The vaccine works at a population level a lot faster if we’re introducing it into a context into which we are throwing all of our other methods to interrupt the virus,” Fitzpatrick said.

While millions of people are growing weary of all the drastic restrictions imposed by the pandemic and the efforts to contain it, keeping them up in the coming months will help ensure that the US finds the quickest and least painful way out of routines bound by Covid-19.",voxdotcom,"['affect', 'population', 'sarscov2', 'really', 'virus', 'covid19', 'major', 'unknowns', 'vaccine', 'protection', 'health', 'spread', 'pandemic', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-30 23:01:00+00:00,7,"Representative-elect Luke Letlow, a Louisiana Republican, died on Tuesday from complications of Covid-19.

The 41-year-old father of two young children, Letlow became the first member of Congress or member-elect to die from the disease. His death has prompted messages of support for his family from both parties, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying in a statement, “Congressman-elect Letlow was a ninth-generation Louisianan who fought passionately for his point of view and dedicated his life to public service.”

“As the House grieves Congressman-elect Letlow’s passing, our sorrow is compounded by the grief of so many other families who have also suffered lives cut short by this terrible virus,” Pelosi continued. “May it be a comfort to Luke’s wife Julia and their children Jeremiah and Jacqueline that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.”

Indeed, Letlow’s death comes as the virus reaches terrifying new heights, having claimed the lives of more than 300,000 Americans. And while he is the first federal elected official to die from Covid-19, many others have tested positive, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and, of course, President Trump.

His death is a reminder that despite claims to the contrary, the disease can and does affect young and healthy people. It’s also a reminder that it is circulating widely pretty much everywhere in America — including at the highest levels of government.

Letlow’s death has federal and Louisiana officials in mourning

Letlow announced on December 18 that he had tested positive for the virus, according to Politico. He was hospitalized the following day, the New York Times reported.

According to a doctor at a Shreveport, Louisiana, hospital where he was treated, Letlow had no underlying conditions that would have predisposed him to serious complications from Covid-19. His death was “all Covid related,” the doctor said.

Asked if Letlow had any underlying conditions that would have made his death more likely, Dr. GE Ghali at LSU-Shreveport said ""None. All covid related."" https://t.co/91R3wGuOEw — Sam Karlin (@samkarlin) December 30, 2020

Letlow is survived by his wife, a 3-year-old son, and an 11-month-old daughter. “The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” a spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.

Among those in Congress offering tributes was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who said in a statement that “our hearts break tonight as we process the news.”

“Luke had such a positive spirit, and a tremendously bright future ahead of him,” the Louisiana congressional delegation said in a joint statement. “He was looking forward to serving the people of Louisiana in Congress, and we were excited to welcome him to our delegation where he was ready to make an even greater impact on our state and our Nation.”

Letlow was set to become the youngest member of the Louisiana delegation, according to NOLA.com. Now, it will be up to Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards to hold a special election for his seat. The governor has not yet announced such an election, though he issued a statement mourning Letlow’s death on Tuesday.

“I am heartbroken that he will not be able to serve our people as a U.S. Representative, but I am even more devastated for his loving family,” the governor said, closing with a reminder of the ongoing crisis of which Letlow’s death forms a part: “Louisiana has lost more than 7,300 people to COVID-19 since March, and each one of them leaves a tremendous hole in our state.”",voxdotcom,"['louisiana', 'congress', 'reminder', 'member', 'virus', 'covid19', 'died', 'letlows', 'family', 'statement', 'positive', 'house', 'luke', 'letlow', 'elected', 'death']",0
2020-12-30 21:06:36+00:00,6,"The United Kingdom on Wednesday authorized its second Covid-19 vaccine for distribution. Developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, the newly approved vaccine costs less and is easier to store than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that received similar approval in the UK on December 2.

Officials said the advantages of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could accelerate the vaccination effort as the UK contends with a new, more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

“This approval means more people can be protected against this virus and will help save lives,” June Raine, chief executive of the UK’s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said in a statement.

The UK aims to vaccinate 1 million people per week and is shifting to a more aggressive vaccination schedule, according to the New York Times. The country will administer the first vaccine dose to “as many people as possible,” rather than try to keep supplies in reserve to ensure everyone receives a second dose, as other countries, including the United States, have done so far.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine’s high stability and low cost could also be a boon to less wealthy nations. If its efficacy is high — and if the vaccine is distributed quickly — it could save countless lives. However, some lingering questions about the results of clinical trials for this vaccine are holding it back from approval in the US, which is conducting its own trials of the vaccine’s effectiveness.

Why the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is different from those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna

In the UK, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is approved for people over the age of 18 and will normally be administered as two doses spaced four to 12 weeks apart. It costs $3 to $4 a dose and can be stored in regular refrigerators. By comparison, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines that have received emergency use authorizations in the US cost between $15 and $25 per dose and require freezers. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in particular needs cold storage at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine also uses a different technology from the Covid-19 immunizations approved so far. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines harness a molecule called mRNA as their platform to deliver the instructions for making a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Oxford and AstraZeneca used a different innovative method, reprogramming another virus to transmit DNA instructions for making parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using another virus to package and deliver genetic material helps the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine remain stable even at higher temperatures.

However, Oxford and AstraZeneca encountered some problems in their clinical trials, including a dosage mistake that led to one group receiving less than a full dose for their initial shot. So far, its efficacy seems to be less than that of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, though well above the 50 percent threshold the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency set for vaccine approval.

But the actual efficacy value remains unclear, ranging between 70 percent and 90 percent efficacy in preventing Covid-19. And Oxford and AstraZeneca have been cagey about certain details surrounding their research.

One reason the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved in the UK but not in the US is that UK regulators evaluate clinical trial data on a rolling basis. The FDA prefers to have more complete trial data. In the US, phase 3 clinical trials of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are still being conducted.

During a press call on December 30, Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, said it might be months before the US gives this vaccine the green light. “We project, if everything goes well, that the readout and emergency use authorization may be granted somewhere early in the month of April,” Slaoui said.

But as in the UK, having another vaccine available in the US, particularly one that’s cheaper and easier to store, would help control the spread of Covid-19. The US government has already invested $1.2 billion in the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and has committed to purchasing 300 million doses.",voxdotcom,"['oxford', 'pfizerbiontech', 'dose', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'trials', 'approved', 'uk', 'oxfordastrazeneca', 'vaccines']",0

2020-12-29 23:33:10+00:00,31,"A new, seemingly more contagious variety of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — that has been spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom has now been found in the United States in at least two locations.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced December 30 that the new strain, known as B.1.1.7 (we’ll call it the UK variant, for simplicity’s sake), was detected in the southern part of the state. It’s the second report of the UK variant in the US in as many days, following news that the variant was found in a male Colorado National Guard member in his 20s with no history of travel, a sign that the virus is spreading locally.

“There is a lot we don’t know about this COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement.

The evidence that this new strain spreads more easily between people is not rock solid, but it’s concerning enough to have forced dramatic action, like shutting down travel from the United Kingdom earlier this month. But it wasn’t enough: The variant has now been detected in Canada, Spain, Sweden, France, and Italy, among others.

At the moment, it doesn’t appear as though the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 is more dangerous in individuals. It doesn’t seem to make people sicker, nor is it more likely to kill them. “I think the key point is that there is no evidence now … that this virus is more pathogenic — creates more problems, more morbidity and mortality — than the previous virus,” Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, said during a December 21 press conference.

What it does appear to do, at least based on preliminary evidence, is spread more quickly among people. That alone is a problem: The coronavirus spreads fast enough as it is. Compounding concerns is that the UK variant echoes a similar story in South Africa, where a strain called 501.V2 has become the dominant version among new cases of the virus. Scientists are wondering whether that strain is more transmissible, too.

The virus has been continually changing its genetics through the course of the pandemic. That’s what RNA-based viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do — they mutate. Most of the time, the mutations mean nothing. But this time, something is different.

“I’ve spent a lot of time this year reminding people that mutations are normal,” molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, who works on a project called Nextstrain, said. For the entire pandemic, scientists around the world have been collecting genetic information about SARS-CoV-2 in a public database called GISAID. Hodcroft and her colleagues at Nextstrain draw on this database to closely track genetic changes in the virus.

In the past, mutations haven’t warranted big newspaper headlines. “I’m now finding myself singing a slightly different tune,” Hodcroft said. This time, there does seem to be evidence that the new strain is something worth being vigilant about. “We probably should consider taking some precautionary measures while we’re trying to find out more,” she added.

At the same time, Covid-19 is surging around the world, even without these new mutations. Scientists are still trying to figure out what these new variants of the coronavirus actually mean for the pandemic. It’s also unclear where else the UK variant may have already spread, aside from the countries where it has been detected. While it was reported in the US only this week, it could have been in the country for much longer. “The variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported December 22.

The good news is that we already know how to respond to these new variants: in the same way we’ve been responding to the pandemic overall. The virus still transmits primarily through viral-laden breaths in the air. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and good indoor ventilation are as critical as ever.

There’s a lot about this story that’s potentially very alarming or confusing. And the story is not yet complete, as scientists need more evidence to understand whether these new variants pose a new threat.

To add some clarity, here’s what researchers have learned so far. Let’s start with the basics.

Viral mutations, explained

Viral mutations. New strains. Increased transmission. It all sounds like scary science fiction. But to demystify things, and to understand why scientists are a little concerned about this new variant — and why most variants don’t faze them — it’s worth understanding how viruses mutate in the first place.

“Oftentimes, I think the word mutation in general conjures up a lot of things in people’s minds, like, you know, Ninja Turtles or X-Men or cancer, like zombie apocalypse-type stuff,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said. “A mutation is just a lot more mundane than that.”

Viruses mutate because they’re constantly making copies of themselves in enormous numbers. To accomplish this, they have to hijack the hardware of a host cell that they infect. However, this process can be a bit sloppy.

Within a human body, a virus can replicate itself millions or billions of times, Hodcroft explains. If you were writing a draft of something millions of times on a computer, extremely quickly, you’d probably make some typos. That’s what’s happening with the viruses. “They make a typo” in their genetic code, she says. One letter of their ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain is replaced with another.

Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, like SARS-CoV-2, are particularly vulnerable to mutations since the RNA molecule itself is more unstable than DNA. The process of copying RNA is also more prone to error.

These typos can be very useful for scientists because they happen at a regular rate, and are passed down through generations of the virus as it spreads through a community. Often, scientists can use these subtle changes to trace certain strains’ lineage and their spread through a population.

The majority of these typos are inconsequential when it comes to human health. “One typo, or even a few typos, doesn’t usually change how the virus works,” Hodcroft says. Some even harm the virus. “You’re much more likely to break it than to make it better” when it comes to mutations, she says.

But in rare instances, some mutations can give a virus an advantage, like allowing it to infect cells more readily or spread among people faster. Those mutant strains can then become dominant within a population.

That might be what we’re looking at here with the UK variant; this new strain may have accumulated typos that could make it more easily transmitted between people.

Four lines of evidence converging on this new mutation being more transmissible

So why do scientists think this variant is more transmissible?

They don’t have this nailed down yet for sure, but four converging streams of evidence are all pointing in the same direction. “That’s making people feel like maybe there is something here to be worried about,” Hodcroft says. “Each one of these things on their own, I would say is not necessarily convincing.” But all together, they paint a concerning picture.

One is that in the areas of the UK where this new variant is spreading, it is accounting for a larger proportion of new cases. “What this implies is that this new variant is spreading better than other variants that are circulating in the same region,” she says.

National testing data shows increased prevalence of the variant in positive cases over time. This is detected incidentally by the commonly used 3-gene PCR test because 69-70del leads to a negative signal. But this does not effect the results of the test. 7/

A second is that the increase didn’t co-occur with any overly obvious change in human behavior. “We don’t really have strong evidence that everyone in the southeast [UK where this variant is spreading] has just ripped their masks off and is, you know, totally violating restrictions,” she says. That said, it could be a coincidence. It could be just that people who happen to have contracted this variant have it are spreading it more often via their behavior.

After all, “this new variant has emerged at a time of the year when there has traditionally been increased family and social mixing,” according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which estimated that the transmissibility of the new variant has increased by 70 percent compared to prior versions of the virus. Both Rasmussen and Hodcroft say the 70 percent more transmissible figure is most likely an overestimate. A recent, not yet peer-reviewed study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine used a mathematical model to estimate that the new strain may be 56 percent more infectious.

Third, there’s some early data about how this variant acts in Covid-19 patients. “There may be slightly higher viral loads in patients with the variants,” Hodcroft says, suggesting the virus has an easier time replicating in the body. (Viral load refers to the amount of virus in the patient. Rasmussen also cautions that viral load data is really sensitive to timing and when the patient was sampled in the course of the illness, so there needs to be more data to confirm this.)

Finally, the genetic changes in the UK variant mirror changes in the South African variant, which has also been associated with rising case numbers. That makes a plausible link: that this particular genetic change may be behind the increased transmissibility in both variants.

However, this is still short of definitive confirmation that the new variant is more transmissible.

According to Slaoui, figuring this out for certain would require laboratory animal testing to see how easily the virus can spread from one organism to another. But this testing can take several weeks.

In the face of that uncertainty, many urge caution.

Again, there’s still no evidence this new variant causes more severe disease. The evidence points only to increased transmissibility. But a more transmissible virus is still a concern. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Hodcroft says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

What does the mutation ... do?

The UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 actually contains 23 mutations in the genome of the virus. “We don’t really know what they do,” Rasmussen says. Individually, many of these mutations have already been seen in other strains of the virus around the world. But the combination of these changes in a single virus could be making the new variant more likely to spread.

However, scientists do think that some mutations may be more important than others, and there are several mechanisms by which mutations could make the virus more infectious. Those include:

1. The virus could end up with changes to its spike protein that allow it to enter cells more easily.

2. The virus could develop a mechanism to replicate more quickly inside a body, which would lead “to people becoming infectious faster, or contagious faster than they would with another variant,” Rasmussen explains.

3. The virus could theoretically have evolved an ability to counteract the cell’s innate immune defenses, making it easier to infect that cell.

One of the pathways scientists suspect may be at work stems from the N501Y mutation, where the amino acid asparagine is replaced by the amino acid tyrosine in the 501st position of the viral protein sequence. It’s one of several mutations in the virus’s spike protein in the UK variant, but N501Y is in the part of the spike that actually comes into direct contact with human cells. The same mutation has been found in the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 that’s also quickly spreading.

Since the virus attaching to a host cell is critical to the virus’s reproduction, the virus’s spike protein is especially important — and delicate.

“If you were just making random changes in the lab, almost any change you make in that area would result in just a dead virus that can no longer get into the cell,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University Texarkana. “That fact that this thing is able to spread at all tells you that it’s at least as good as the original version. The fact that it’s spreading faster may indicate that it’s a little bit better at grabbing on to host cells, which is the first step of the entry process.”

But this particular N501Y mutation has already been detected in strains that have risen and fallen in other parts of the world over the course of the pandemic. So it may be that the other mutations coupled with N501Y are having some sort of compounding effect. And scientists still need to do more work to determine if this is actually what’s causing the rise of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Finding out the answer could help researchers come up with ways to counter this variety of the coronavirus.

How did these coronavirus mutations happen?

Scientists don’t know exactly how the UK variant came to be. But there may be a clue. Hodcroft is struck by the sheer number of mutations in the UK variant — 23 in all — which makes her suspect it’s possible this variant arose in an immunocompromised person. “It’s an above-average number of mutations,” she says.

In most people, she explains, the immune system mounts a full-on assault on the virus, eliminating it in a matter of a couple of weeks. “In people that have compromised immune systems, though, there’s a very different dynamic,” she says. “So, for one thing, the virus could be in them for months instead of weeks.” That gives the virus more time to evolve, to accumulate mutations that might make it easier to thwart the immune system.

“It’s one scenario,” she says. “We may never know exactly what happened here.”

The basic truth: The more this virus spreads, the more chances there are for dangerous new variants to emerge. In any person — or animal, for that matter — the chance for a dangerous new variant to arise is rare. But rare things can happen when there are so many cases: more than 80 million confirmed cases worldwide.

Since viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are mutating and since Covid-19 has spread in so many people, it’s theoretically only a matter of time before a certain set of mutations align in a way to give the virus a boost.

What can we do about Covid-19 mutants?

To stop mutations, quite simply, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Rasmussen says. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

We fight the new variant as we would any variant of SARS-CoV-2: with masks, with social distancing, with good hand hygiene. “I don’t think people should be panicking,” Hodcroft says. “Lower case numbers, no matter what the variant, are better.”

It’s already been said but if we actually follow protocol and have policies that support those protocols a new variant that is more transmissible would be combatted just as an older variant. So like worry less about mutants and more about masking and distancing and vaccination. — K. Taylor, Ph.D., M.S. (@KYT_ThatsME) December 21, 2020

Scientists have one more tool, though: genetic tracking. At Nextstrain, Hodcroft and her colleagues receive viral genetic sequences from all over the world to try to paint a real-time picture of transmission chains and keep tabs on how the virus is changing. But not every place in the world is providing the same amount of data.

The UK does a lot of viral sequencing, for instance. It was able to pick up on the new viral strain quickly because of that. In other locations around the globe, that might not have happened so fast.

“In the US, it’s a really spotty picture,” Hodcroft says when it comes to sequencing. “Some states have really invested in sequencing; some states haven’t. So for some states, we probably have a fair idea of what’s going on. In other states, we really don’t have many sequences.”

Overall, the CDC reports that the US has sequenced only 51,000 of the more than 17 million cases reported in the country. That’s 0.07 percent. In comparison, the UK aims to sequence 10,000 virus samples per week, and plans to increase that capacity further. (In addition: The UK sequences the genomes faster than the US, according to infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford.) That lack of viral genetic testing creates a big blind spot in the US. The UK variant could have already arrived here undetected “given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced,” the CDC states.

More sequencing, overall, would lead to the faster detection of new strains and faster means to contain them if they were deemed problematic.

Do mutations mean a Covid-19 vaccine won’t work anymore?

With new mutations, there is a concern that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 could arise that would be different enough from previous versions such that prior exposures — whether through a vaccine or an infection — won’t offer protection. So, yes, it’s possible that the coronavirus could someday mutate in a way that would elude a vaccine or previous immunity.

Right now, though, scientists think this UK variant would still fall under the same umbrella of protection as earlier strains. If someone received a Covid-19 vaccine for an older generation of the virus, they would likely have protection against this one.

To explain why, it helps to understand how the immune system deals with viruses. When the human body detects a hostile foreign entity like a virus, it starts to produce antibodies (proteins that attach to the virus or to infected cells). Antibodies can then interfere with how the virus works. They can also flag the virus or virus-infected cells for destruction by other immune cells.

The specific places where the antibodies attach to the virus are called epitopes, and most Covid-19 vaccines target epitopes on the virus’s spike protein (which is what the virus uses to attach to human cells and enter them).

“The good thing with the vaccine is that it induces an immune response against several epitopes that have been mapped around the spike protein,” Slaoui said. “The chances that one set of mutations would alter all those epitopes, I think, are extremely very low. The expectation, scientifically, is that these kinds of variations are unlikely to escape fully the protective response by the vaccine.”

More good news: Scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch have announced (via a tweet) preliminary evidence that antibodies that neutralize the more common strain of the virus also neutralize a strain with the N501Y mutation (the one that impacts the part of the virus that comes into direct contact with human cells, as mentioned above). That suggests that an immune system primed — by a natural infection, at least — to fight the old variant can also fight one with this specific mutation.

Some good news (and incredibly fast work) on one of the mutations scientists are worried about: N501Y.

In these lab experiments serum from recovered #covid19 patients was just as good at neutralizing virus with the mutation as without it. https://t.co/SIxfo2x3qp — Kai Kupferschmidt (@kakape) December 22, 2020

Texas A&M’s Neuman noted that there’s also evidence right now showing how well vaccines can protect against mutated forms of the virus in clinical trials. Many of the vaccines being administered were engineered to counter the earliest generations of SARS-CoV-2 but are still showing themselves to be highly effective against Covid-19 caused by more recent versions of the virus.

“All the tests are being done, all the papers being published, are being done with current strains, which have several mutations relative to [the first iterations of the virus], and it does still seem to be working,” Neuman said.

Covid-19 vaccine developers say they are keeping a close eye on these changes and testing to make sure their vaccines are still effective. “In terms of the new variant, Pfizer and BioNTech are monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequence changes and the companies are working to generate data on how well serum from people immunized with [the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine] may be able to neutralize the new strain,” said a Pfizer spokesperson via email.

And the new Covid-19 vaccines are well equipped to adapt. The two that have received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration — the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine — both use mRNA as their platform. These vaccines deliver the instructions for making the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Those human cells then manufacture the component themselves, allowing the immune system to use it to prepare for an infection. One huge advantage of this approach is that the mRNA sequence can be altered quickly; the first such vaccines for Covid-19 were developed within days after the genetic sequence of the virus was posted online.

Could manufacturers like Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech then retool their vaccines to target the new variants without going through the whole tedious clinical trial process again?

Possibly, according to Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA and a professor of medicine at Georgetown University. He told Vox that vaccines for new variants of the influenza virus are approved every year without large-scale trials. New versions of a Covid-19 vaccine to accommodate mutations similarly might not need another round of study in tens of thousands of people, but may require some testing to figure out dosing and immune response. With such a new virus and brand new vaccines, the regulations for these situations have not yet been laid out.

Should we expect more mutations in the future?

Short answer: yes.

The UK and South African variants are unlikely to be the last to make headlines. Coronavirus is constantly evolving. We should expect it to keep changing slightly.

“There will be new variants that emerge,” Rasmussen says. The thing is, with each new significant strain, scientists will have to do careful work to determine whether it’s more dangerous.

And there are some mutations we can perhaps even expect — if not in the coming weeks, over the next several years.

Recently, virology researchers at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center published a preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) study, looking at how a coronavirus that causes the common cold evolved from the 1980s onward. To accomplish that, they got old blood samples, which included antibodies that cling to this particular virus. They also reconstructed pieces of the cold virus from other eras. Basically, they wanted to see if older blood could still neutralize newer virus. If it couldn’t, that would indicate the virus has evolved over time to evade the immune system.

Here’s what the researchers found: “This other human coronavirus does indeed evolve over the course of multiple years to gradually escape human immunity,” Jesse Bloom, a virologist who co-authored the study, says. “So we think this suggests that there’s the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to do the same thing.” But Bloom stresses that this process takes years. It’s enough time to prepare, to monitor, and to potentially tweak vaccine formulations to keep up with the virus’s evolution.

It’s not like the virus can evolve into an entirely different beast. “It can mutate to maybe escape antibodies,” Rachel Eguia, the study’s lead author, says. But it can’t change so much that it alters its ability to enter cells.

Scientists are also keeping their eyes out for a rapid, major mutation event known as recombination. That’s where an individual is infected with two different strains of the virus at the same time, allowing the virus strains to swap parts. These new viruses could then evade the antibodies that targeted their predecessors. Some researchers think that recombination might be how SARS-CoV-2 originated in the first place.

“This is all hypothetical in this particular virus, but it happens in other viruses all the time,” Neuman said.

Faced with these looming challenges, reducing the transmission of the coronavirus in general is still the best way to protect the fragile progress made in the Covid-19 pandemic so far. Reducing transmissions is also one of the best ways to make sure powerful tools like vaccines remain potent for as long as possible. The fact that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are coming out is not a cause for complacency, and these new variants of SARS-CoV-2 highlight how important it is to remain vigilant.

2020-12-29 21:56:09+00:00,17,"Striking a grim tone in Wilmington, Delaware, President-elect Joe Biden warned that defeating Covid-19 through widespread vaccination will be the “greatest operational challenge we’ve ever faced as a nation.”

Biden says he expects “incredible opportunities for our nation in the years ahead,” declaring that the economy is “poised to come back.” However, to get there, Biden newly pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to accelerate private industry manufacturing of protective equipment and vaccines. The president-elect also promised Congress that he would propose another Covid-19 relief package early next year.

As Vox’s Alex Ward has explained, the DPA, which President Donald Trump has used to provide some medical equipment, would allow the federal government to require that companies fulfill its orders before they complete any other commercial orders.

In early December, Biden announced a goal of 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days, but vaccine distribution woes imperil this benchmark. Biden himself threw cold water on this goal in his remarks when he pointed out that the Trump administration’s goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans by the year’s end is extremely unlikely seeing as the United States has only vaccinated “a few million” people so far.

Earlier on Tuesday, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received her first shot of the Moderna vaccine in Washington, DC, on live TV. Biden received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 21, also on live TV as part of his bid to increase confidence in the safety of the inoculation. And Vice President Mike Pence received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine a few days earlier.

Along with his goal of mass vaccinations, Biden also recently pledged two other priorities: universal mask-wearing and reopening the majority of schools within his first 100 days. He reiterated the importance of both of these objectives in this speech, noting that Congress needed to allocate funds to schools so that they can reopen.

Today, I'm announcing key COVID-19 priorities for the first 100 days of my administration:



- Everyone wears a mask

- 100 million vaccinations

- Reopen the majority of schools



With these steps, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) December 8, 2020

“It’s not small what we’re asking of you, but we’re in this together,” Biden said, acknowledging the difficulty of asking people to continue social distancing and mask-wearing for several more months. Though Biden’s speech was focused on charting a clear course to defeating the virus, in his self-described best-case scenario — where a million Americans a day are receiving the vaccine — the country could be well into 2021 before coming close to herd immunity.

It’s a long, cold Covid-19 winter

Biden’s remarks come as Covid-19 cases have surged to their highest levels over the holiday season. On December 28, the day before Biden’s address, the United States recorded over 189,000 new cases and almost 1,900 deaths.

Vox’s German Lopez analyzes weekly where each state is on Covid-19 cases, infection rates, and test positivity rates based on data from the New York Times and the Census Bureau. As of his most recent pre-holiday update on December 16, not a single state had “fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people.” Lopez writes that daily case rates are the “most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak.”

While experts have not definitively traced a surge due to Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings, expectations are that cases and deaths will spike in the coming weeks.",voxdotcom,"['100', 'biden', 'cases', 'days', 'received', 'pledges', 'covid19', 'production', 'invoke', 'vaccine', 'rates', 'act', 'goal', 'million', 'package', 'defense', 'relief']",0
2020-12-29 20:30:44+00:00,15,"Two highly effective Covid-19 vaccines are now being administered across the United States, and more are in the pipeline. Almost 2 million people have already received the first of two doses of these vaccines, and officials are aiming to immunize one-third of the US population by the end of March 2021.

It’s a stunning accomplishment for a disease that was barely known to the world a year ago, and it means that an end to the crisis is in sight. Yet the US remains in the worst throes of the pandemic to date, with hospitalizations and deaths continuing to break records.

Vaccines are critical in drawing down the pandemic as we know it, but it won’t be a simple return to the world before Covid-19. It will likely be a process that lasts several months, and precautions like social distancing and wearing masks will still be needed until there is widespread immunity to the virus.

“It’s a bit of a glide path in my mind toward a new normal, and a new normal that will continue to get better and better,” said Ashish Jha, dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University. “Ultimately, the mental model that I’m going for is ‘When are people going about their day and not thinking about Covid?’”

Exactly when and how this will happen hinges on several key variables relating to vaccines that scientists and health officials are still trying to sort out.

The vaccines being administered right now — the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — have only received emergency use authorizations, not full approval, from the Food and Drug Administration. Regulators have determined that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks for most adults at high risk of exposure, but there are still some unanswered questions, such as how long protection lasts and how well these vaccines block transmission of the virus between people.

And beyond the vaccines themselves, how quickly and how readily people accept them can change the course of the pandemic.

How well a Covid-19 vaccine contains the pandemic depends on the answers to several key questions

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines are still ongoing, and more clarity will emerge in the coming months. But for now, these remain some of the most important unknowns.

How well do vaccines prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2?

Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reported efficacies of roughly 95 percent against Covid-19 disease, meaning they protected the vast majority of recipients from getting sick enough to have disease symptoms, like loss of smell, fever, and cough.

However, Covid-19 is caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, that some people can carry and transmit without having any symptoms at all — whether or not they eventually end up feeling ill.

Finding the people who are carrying the virus (and preventing them from infecting others) is therefore critical to control the spread of the virus, but has proven to be a persistent obstacle during the pandemic. Currently, the main way to identify the infected is by proactively testing for the virus and, ideally, tracing who else they encountered. It’s a tedious, time-consuming process.

This is also true in vaccine clinical trials. Phase 3 trials mainly look at how well vaccines prevent disease in the real world, something that’s readily apparent when comparing the number of disease events in the vaccine group to the placebo group. It only takes 150 events or so to yield results on how well the vaccine prevents disease.

But to gauge efficacy against preventing infections, including low-grade infections that don’t generate symptoms, researchers will have to test the tens of thousands of participants in their phase 3 trial. It’s likely that a Covid-19 vaccine would reduce transmission, but it’s not clear yet by how much.

“What we know is that we’ve been seeing studies focusing specifically on efficacy with regards to severity of disease, meaning ameliorating the severity of the disease itself, but there’s still no studies that really are going to help us understand how we can certainly interrupt transmission,” said Maria Elena Bottazzi, a co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.

The companies conducting trials do plan to test their participants to see if there were any hidden infections, but it may be a while before they report their results.

That said, Moderna presented some early data showing that its vaccine does begin to reduce infections between its doses, which are spaced 28 days apart.

“There were approximately 2/3 fewer swabs that were positive in the vaccine group as compared to the placebo group at the pre-dose 2 timepoint, suggesting that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose,” according to Moderna’s report to the FDA. However, these results are preliminary and will require follow-up testing to see if this effect lasts longer than a few weeks.

The more that a vaccine can reduce the virus’s transmission, the more quickly a population can move toward herd immunity, the point where the virus can no longer spread easily between people. Scientists estimate that herd immunity threshold is when roughly between 60 percent and 90 percent of a population is immune to this virus, whether through a vaccine or from natural exposure. (A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that health workers in the United Kingdom exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced protective antibodies against the virus and were protected against reinfection for at least six months.)

But vaccines might not protect every single person who gets a shot from getting infected, just like they don’t provide a 100 percent guarantee against getting sick. That means even the vaccinated will still have to wear face masks and keep their distance from others to prevent virus transmission until immunity is widespread.

How long do vaccines protect against Covid-19?

The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech trials have shown that their vaccines start to provide protection against Covid-19 illness quickly — and that protection starts building up right after the first dose.

Whether that protection fades after a few months or a few years is unclear. And researchers can only find out by waiting and observing. That means monitoring the thousands of participants of clinical trials, as well as recipients of the vaccines in the general population, for years. Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as Moderna, have committed to actively monitoring the participants in their clinical trials for at least two years. They are also keeping an eye on people who are receiving their vaccines.

But hints on the durability of vaccine protection could arrive sooner. Looking at vaccine recipients six months or one year after they receive their injections, researchers should be able to see how many were infected with SARS-CoV-2 — and when — to get an early estimate of how quickly protection weakens.

“That would give us potentially some information for what future years will look like,” said Meagan Fitzpatrick, an assistant professor at the center for vaccine development and global health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “You will definitely get some signal, but you don’t know really for sure in a way that’s backed up by data until that amount of time passes from when the first people got their first doses.”

Longer protection would buy time for the health sector as vaccines roll out since they wouldn’t have to worry about reinfections or revaccinating people. Evidence from past coronavirus outbreaks like SARS and MERS showed that among survivors, protection for those diseases lasted for several years. But SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and much remains uncertain.

There’s also a chance that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate in a way that would escape the protection offered by a vaccine. However, scientists say that’s unlikely in the near term because Covid-19 vaccines target several different parts of the virus and the odds of simultaneous mutations in all of those regions are low.

But more study is needed to yield more definite answers, and the best way to reduce the likelihood of major mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its spread.

How quickly can we get the vaccine to everyone?

The United States is now in the midst of its largest vaccination campaign in history, an endeavor that’s anywhere from three to four times as big as vaccinating against seasonal flu, according to Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Operation Warp Speed vaccine program.

It’s a delicate and critical process. “How soon can we really start driving our Covid numbers low really definitely depends on rollout,” Fitzpatrick said. “A vaccine is only as good as the doses that actually get into people.”

However, the debut of Covid-19 vaccines has already hit several bumps. Some states have reported that their initial allotments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were cut, while the manufacturer reported that many doses have gone unclaimed.

Part of the challenge is technical constraints of the vaccines themselves. Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines require maintaining cold temperatures from factories to transportation to clinics. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in particular demands ultra-cold storage at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).

Another complicating factor is simply sorting out who should get the vaccines and when. Enough doses are not immediately available for everyone, so health officials have to make delicate decisions about who to prioritize.

The vaccines available so far have to be administered as two doses spaced several weeks apart, so everyone will have to come back for a second shot. Doses have to be set aside for follow-ups and if people don’t get their second dose, they may have protection that’s less robust or less durable than expected. In a large enough population, that could erode the power of a vaccine to contain the virus.

At the same time, health officials will have to overcome vaccine hesitancy. Getting a high uptake of vaccines is critical in drawing down pandemic restrictions. And the more holdouts there are, the longer it will take. The good news is that reluctance to getting a vaccine seems to have diminished in the United States. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 71 percent of Americans said they would likely get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 63 percent in September.

A vaccine is not just about protecting individuals, but protecting a population as a whole. With enough people immunized, even people who haven’t received the vaccine — including those who can’t get vaccinated for health reasons — will experience a much lower risk of infection.

“If you really, really, really want to interrupt and really get rid of this pandemic, you really need high levels of [vaccine] coverage and very high levels of efficacy,” Bottazzi said.

And over the coming months, more Covid-19 vaccines will likely gain approval. That will help ease some of the supply constraints, but will add to the complexity of administering them. Each vaccine has its own storage requirements, dosing schedule, and may be best suited for different demographics.

Taken together, there’s a lot that can go wrong with distributing vaccines. But getting these steps right would mean a much faster route out of the Covid-19 crisis.

How well will the US control the spread of the virus?

In addition to vaccinating millions of people, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical. Efforts to contain the virus will allow the vaccine to have a much greater impact. Vaccines could be targeted to hot spots, for instance, rather than having to push back against a national onslaught.

As mentioned earlier, curtailing the virus’s transmission also reduces the likelihood of a mutation that could render a vaccine less effective. (But if virus variants discovered in the UK that appear more transmissive spread widely in the US, that could complicate efforts of curbing spread, even if the vaccine is just as effective against these variants.)

If all goes fairly well with the logistics of vaccine distribution, it will take weeks to months for it to actually start reducing hospitalizations and fatalities from Covid-19.

A vaccine is meant to prevent illness, so it will do little for people who are already ill with Covid-19. And the SARS-CoV-2 virus can incubate in a person for up to two weeks before the individual starts to show symptoms, and it can take longer after that for them to seek treatment.

As such, there will be a lag in seeing the impacts of a vaccine across the population. But slowing the spread of the virus would make vaccines a more powerful tool to end the pandemic, and results would start to manifest much sooner. Vaccination is also going to be working in tandem with immunity people have built up from surviving infection. Almost 20 million people in the US have been infected to date. “Around 30 percent population immunity, things start slowing a little bit, especially in the places that have been hit hard,” Jha said.

Conversely, if Covid-19 continues to rage out of control, it will be much harder for a vaccine to make a difference in morbidity and mortality, and it will take even longer to see results.

We still need testing, masking, distancing, and treatments

While scientists and health experts have been elated at the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, they’ve also been adamant that vaccines on their own are not enough to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

The existing measures for slowing Covid-19 remain just as important as they’ve ever been, if not more so, given that hospitalizations and daily deaths are continuing to mount. Tactics like wearing face masks, rigorous hand-washing, and avoiding large gatherings and close contact with others will still be needed in the coming months, even among people who have been immunized.

Treatments for Covid-19 are also critical since they are the most immediate way to reduce fatalities. Approaches like monoclonal antibodies will be needed to help people survive the illness.

Widespread testing for Covid-19 will also continue to be crucial to identify potential spreaders and to allow people in key jobs to continue working.

It’s a sliding scale between these variables. For example, better testing and tracing could allow people more freedom even if they are not immune. Or effective treatments can drastically reduce fatality rates, reducing the burden of the disease.

However, pressure on all fronts — vaccines, treatment, testing, social distancing — is what will end the crisis the soonest. “The vaccine works at a population level a lot faster if we’re introducing it into a context into which we are throwing all of our other methods to interrupt the virus,” Fitzpatrick said.

2020-12-29 17:50:09+00:00,27,"In just over three weeks, Donald Trump will no longer be president, but he’s spent his last month in office sowing discord. His latest chaos muppetry — a demand that Congress increase the latest round of stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 — has now given Democrats a slim chance to deliver more aid to Americans. And, barring that, a chance to make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s life more difficult.

After the House on Monday passed a bill increasing the “economic impact payments” — in other words, stimulus checks — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is continuing the fight.

Sanders, with support from the Senate Democratic caucus, plans to use a series of procedural moves to delay a vote on a bipartisan defense authorization bill. These maneuvers can’t prevent the defense bill from becoming law, but that’s not really the point. The bill is considered a must-pass, and Sanders’s objections can delay passage, annoy Senate Republicans, and potentially force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to raise a series of objections that could damage his party’s ability to hold onto its Senate majority.

And Sanders also has a clear demand: He will lift his objections to an immediate vote on the defense bill if McConnell permits a vote on legislation providing $2,000 checks to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year.

This week on the Senate floor Mitch McConnell wants to vote to override Trump's veto of the $740 billion defense funding bill and then head home for the New Year.



I'm going to object until we get a vote on legislation to provide a $2,000 direct payment to the working class. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) December 28, 2020

The first round of this fight played out shortly after noon Tuesday on the Senate floor, during an exchange between McConnell, Sanders, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). McConnell sought a vote on the defense bill, and Sanders objected unless the Senate immediately holds an up or down vote on the $2,000 payments.

The politics of this fight favor Democrats. A recent Data for Progress poll shows that 78 percent of likely voters support the $2,000 direct payment. Trump himself backs it as well; he continues to tweet his support for $2,000 checks. On Monday, the House voted in favor of $2,000 checks, with 44 Republicans joining nearly every Democrat in favoring the legislation.

And all of this is happening as Republicans fight to hold onto two Senate seats in Georgia, a state that recently voted for Democratic President-elect Joe Biden — two seats, it’s worth noting, that will decide who controls the Senate in 2021.

If Sanders’s gambit fails, it wouldn’t be the first time that very popular legislation died in Mitch McConnell’s Senate. And McConnell still has ways out; he suggested Tuesday he could tie proposals unfavorable to Democrats to the increased stimulus checks, in order to make the entire proposition more unpalatable.

But the strange mix of circumstances that brought us to the point gives Democrats a small chance to make the $2,000 checks a reality.

The many end-of-2020 legislative fights, briefly explained

Congress entered the holiday season with three high priority items on its plate. The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual affair that sets much of the nation’s defense policy for the next year, and that instructs the military on how to spend its budget. Legislation funding much of the federal government was also set to expire last Monday, meaning that the unfunded agencies would shut down unless new money was appropriated to keep them open.

And then there’s the economic fallout from a pandemic that’s forced much of the country to remain at home, and shuttered countless businesses across the nation. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion package to relieve these financial burdens in May, but the GOP-led Senate dithered on Covid-19 relief for the next several months.

Senate Republicans, however, appeared to take a new interest in aid once their Senate majority was endangered by the two Georgia Senate races, which will be decided in a January 5 runoff election.

Racing against the end of the year — and the end of the current congressional session on January 3 — Congress managed to pass the NDAA on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, and (after a few delays) a mega government funding and stimulus bill.

Georgia Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are both campaigning on their support for Covid-19 relief, and the Senate’s decision to pass $900 billion in relief funding allowed incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler to take some credit for that bill.

But just as everything appeared settled for the year, Trump decided to spend the last couple weeks upping the level of difficulty.

The outgoing president vetoed the defense authorization bill, citing his objection to a provision requiring the military to rename facilities named after Confederate traitors, as well as a demand that the bill repeal a quarter-century-old legal provision that makes it possible for websites such as Twitter to exist.

He also briefly threatened to veto the Covid-19 relief-government funding bill — though he backed down on that threat and signed the omnibus legislation on Sunday evening. Among other things, Trump claimed that the Covid-19 relief bill should have provided a $2,000 check to low- and middle-income Americans. The bill he signed provides only a $600 check.

The punchline is that the Senate needs to return to Washington this week to override Trump’s veto on the defense bill (the House already voted to override Trump’s veto on Monday). And that gives Senate Democrats a brief window to push for the $2,000 checks.

Georgia’s Republican senators are in a bind

Even before Biden’s victory, McConnell resisted many calls for additional Covid-19 relief spending, at times claiming that he was more concerned about the national debt. During the Obama years, McConnell and his fellow congressional Republicans frequently cited deficit fears to push for austerity budgets, although they fell out of love with deficit hawkery almost as soon as a Republican took up residence in the White House.

With Biden set to take office next month, Republicans ordinarily could be expected to return to their position under Obama — resisting spending bills that could boost the economy under a Democratic president.

But Biden isn’t president yet, and the most immediate electoral concern for Senate Republicans is holding onto the two Georgia seats. Neither Perdue nor Loeffler wants to be on the unpopular side of a fight over the $2,000 checks, and both have come out in support of them — Perdue did so as recently as Tuesday morning.

President @realdonaldtrump is right — I support this push for $2,000 in direct relief for the American people. https://t.co/Al3USM7zPr — David Perdue (@Perduesenate) December 29, 2020

Perdue and Loeffler’s rhetorical support for the $2,000 checks will mean little to Americans who would benefit from those checks if the Senate never votes to approve them. And the two senators may not gain much political advantage from endorsing more direct relief if their own Senate leader maneuvers to block such a vote — which is where Bernie Sanders comes in.

The Senate rules are a maze of dilatory tactics, mandatory waiting periods, and other procedures that allow the minority to put off votes until later. A determined majority leader can still bring bills to the floor, but not before wasting days overcoming these obstacles.

Typically, these delays are avoided through unanimous consent. If no senator objects to the majority leader’s request to bypass the many delays permitted by the Senate rules, then the chamber’s business can proceed very quickly. McConnell hoped to have unanimous consent to move to an immediate vote on the defense bill veto override on Tuesday, but Sanders moved to deny McConnell such consent.

Without unanimous consent, McConnell will need to use a multi-day process to bring the veto override vote to the floor over Sanders’s objection. Democrats, meanwhile, can spend that time repeatedly seeking a vote on the $2,000 checks — forcing McConnell to either acquiesce in that request or go on record opposing the vote.

McConnell could also try to attach a poison pill to legislation providing for $2,000 checks and call a vote on a modified bill that Democrats would find unacceptable, but Sanders and other members of the Democratic caucus could still delay a vote on the defense bill unless Republicans agree to remove the poison pill.

Again, acting alone, the Democratic minority cannot force a vote on the $2,000 in direct relief. But they may not have to. The easiest way to get to an immediate vote on the defense bill is to hold an up or down vote on the $2,000 checks, and allow every senator to go on record as for or against them. If the GOP-controlled Senate passed the enhanced Covid-19 relief bill, Perdue and Loeffler may even be able to plausibly claim a share of the credit for its passage.

Senate Republicans, in other words, are likely to find themselves torn between a desire to pivot to deficit hawkery in anticipation of Biden’s presidency, and a desire to shore up two vulnerable senators that Republicans need if they hope to maintain a Senate majority.

It’s far from certain that the latter desire will be enough to pass the $2,000 in direct payments, but proponents of more Covid-19 relief have a little more reason to be optimistic than they did just a week ago.",voxdotcom,"['checks', 'bill', '2000', 'senate', 'bernie', 'covid19', 'vote', 'plans', 'republicans', 'mcconnell', 'defense', 'relief', 'sanders', 'force']",0
2020-12-29 01:31:59+00:00,14,"Two highly effective Covid-19 vaccines are now being administered across the United States, and more are in the pipeline. Almost 2 million people have already received the first of two doses of these vaccines, and officials are aiming to immunize one-third of the US population by the end of March 2021.

It’s a stunning accomplishment for a disease that was barely known to the world a year ago, and it means that an end to the crisis is in sight. Yet the US remains in the worst throes of the pandemic to date, with hospitalizations and deaths continuing to break records.

Vaccines are critical in drawing down the pandemic as we know it, but it won’t be a simple return to the world before Covid-19. It will likely be a process that lasts several months, and precautions like social distancing and wearing masks will still be needed until there is widespread immunity to the virus.

“It’s a bit of a glide path in my mind toward a new normal, and a new normal that will continue to get better and better,” said Ashish Jha, dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University. “Ultimately, the mental model that I’m going for is ‘When are people going about their day and not thinking about Covid?’”

Exactly when and how this will happen hinges on several key variables relating to vaccines that scientists and health officials are still trying to sort out.

The vaccines being administered right now — the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — have only received emergency use authorizations, not full approval, from the Food and Drug Administration. Regulators have determined that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks for most adults at high risk of exposure, but there are still some unanswered questions, such as how long protection lasts and how well these vaccines block transmission of the virus between people.

And beyond the vaccines themselves, how quickly and how readily people accept them can change the course of the pandemic.

How well a Covid-19 vaccine contains the pandemic depends on the answers to several key questions

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines are still ongoing, and more clarity will emerge in the coming months. But for now, these remain some of the most important unknowns.

How well do vaccines prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2?

Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reported efficacies of roughly 95 percent against Covid-19 disease, meaning they protected the vast majority of recipients from getting sick enough to have disease symptoms, like loss of smell, fever, and cough.

However, Covid-19 is caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, that some people can carry and transmit without having any symptoms at all — whether or not they eventually end up feeling ill.

Finding the people who are carrying the virus (and preventing them from infecting others) is therefore critical to control the spread of the virus, but has proven to be a persistent obstacle during the pandemic. Currently, the main way to identify the infected is by proactively testing for the virus and, ideally, tracing who else they encountered. It’s a tedious, time-consuming process.

This is also true in vaccine clinical trials. Phase 3 trials mainly look at how well vaccines prevent disease in the real world, something that’s readily apparent when comparing the number of disease events in the vaccine group to the placebo group. It only takes 150 events or so to yield results on how well the vaccine prevents disease.

But to gauge efficacy against preventing infections, including low-grade infections that don’t generate symptoms, researchers will have to test the tens of thousands of participants in their phase 3 trial. It’s likely that a Covid-19 vaccine would reduce transmission, but it’s not clear yet by how much.

“What we know is that we’ve been seeing studies focusing specifically on efficacy with regards to severity of disease, meaning ameliorating the severity of the disease itself, but there’s still no studies that really are going to help us understand how we can certainly interrupt transmission,” said Maria Elena Bottazzi, a co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.

The companies conducting trials do plan to test their participants to see if there were any hidden infections, but it may be a while before they report their results.

That said, Moderna presented some early data showing that its vaccine does begin to reduce infections between its doses, which are spaced 28 days apart.

“There were approximately 2/3 fewer swabs that were positive in the vaccine group as compared to the placebo group at the pre-dose 2 timepoint, suggesting that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose,” according to Moderna’s report to the FDA. However, these results are preliminary and will require follow-up testing to see if this effect lasts longer than a few weeks.

The more that a vaccine can reduce the virus’s transmission, the more quickly a population can move toward herd immunity, the point where the virus can no longer spread easily between people. Scientists estimate that herd immunity threshold is when roughly between 60 percent and 90 percent of a population is immune to this virus, whether through a vaccine or from natural exposure. (A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that health workers in the United Kingdom exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced protective antibodies against the virus and were protected against reinfection for at least six months.)

But vaccines might not protect every single person who gets a shot from getting infected, just like they don’t provide a 100 percent guarantee against getting sick. That means even the vaccinated will still have to wear face masks and keep their distance from others to prevent virus transmission until immunity is widespread.

How long do vaccines protect against Covid-19?

The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech trials have shown that their vaccines start to provide protection against Covid-19 illness quickly — and that protection starts building up right after the first dose.

Whether that protection fades after a few months or a few years is unclear. And researchers can only find out by waiting and observing. That means monitoring the thousands of participants of clinical trials, as well as recipients of the vaccines in the general population, for years. Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as Moderna, have committed to actively monitoring the participants in their clinical trials for at least two years. They are also keeping an eye on people who are receiving their vaccines.

But hints on the durability of vaccine protection could arrive sooner. Looking at vaccine recipients six months or one year after they receive their injections, researchers should be able to see how many were infected with SARS-CoV-2 — and when — to get an early estimate of how quickly protection weakens.

“That would give us potentially some information for what future years will look like,” said Meagan Fitzpatrick, an assistant professor at the center for vaccine development and global health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “You will definitely get some signal, but you don’t know really for sure in a way that’s backed up by data until that amount of time passes from when the first people got their first doses.”

Longer protection would buy time for the health sector as vaccines roll out since they wouldn’t have to worry about reinfections or revaccinating people. Evidence from past coronavirus outbreaks like SARS and MERS showed that among survivors, protection for those diseases lasted for several years. But SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and much remains uncertain.

There’s also a chance that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate in a way that would escape the protection offered by a vaccine. However, scientists say that’s unlikely in the near term because Covid-19 vaccines target several different parts of the virus and the odds of simultaneous mutations in all of those regions are low.

But more study is needed to yield more definite answers, and the best way to reduce the likelihood of major mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its spread.

How quickly can we get the vaccine to everyone?

The United States is now in the midst of its largest vaccination campaign in history, an endeavor that’s anywhere from three to four times as big as vaccinating against seasonal flu, according to Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Operation Warp Speed vaccine program.

It’s a delicate and critical process. “How soon can we really start driving our Covid numbers low really definitely depends on rollout,” Fitzpatrick said. “A vaccine is only as good as the doses that actually get into people.”

However, the debut of Covid-19 vaccines has already hit several bumps. Some states have reported that their initial allotments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were cut, while the manufacturer reported that many doses have gone unclaimed.

Part of the challenge is technical constraints of the vaccines themselves. Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines require maintaining cold temperatures from factories to transportation to clinics. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in particular demands ultra-cold storage at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).

Another complicating factor is simply sorting out who should get the vaccines and when. Enough doses are not immediately available for everyone, so health officials have to make delicate decisions about who to prioritize.

The vaccines available so far have to be administered as two doses spaced several weeks apart, so everyone will have to come back for a second shot. Doses have to be set aside for follow-ups and if people don’t get their second dose, they may have protection that’s less robust or less durable than expected. In a large enough population, that could erode the power of a vaccine to contain the virus.

At the same time, health officials will have to overcome vaccine hesitancy. Getting a high uptake of vaccines is critical in drawing down pandemic restrictions. And the more holdouts there are, the longer it will take. The good news is that reluctance to getting a vaccine seems to have diminished in the United States. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 71 percent of Americans said they would likely get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 63 percent in September.

A vaccine is not just about protecting individuals, but protecting a population as a whole. With enough people immunized, even people who haven’t received the vaccine — including those who can’t get vaccinated for health reasons — will experience a much lower risk of infection.

“If you really, really, really want to interrupt and really get rid of this pandemic, you really need high levels of [vaccine] coverage and very high levels of efficacy,” Bottazzi said.

And over the coming months, more Covid-19 vaccines will likely gain approval. That will help ease some of the supply constraints, but will add to the complexity of administering them. Each vaccine has its own storage requirements, dosing schedule, and may be best suited for different demographics.

Taken together, there’s a lot that can go wrong with distributing vaccines. But getting these steps right would mean a much faster route out of the Covid-19 crisis.

How well will the US control the spread of the virus?

In addition to vaccinating millions of people, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical. Efforts to contain the virus will allow the vaccine to have a much greater impact. Vaccines could be targeted to hot spots, for instance, rather than having to push back against a national onslaught.

As mentioned earlier, curtailing the virus’s transmission also reduces the likelihood of a mutation that could render a vaccine less effective. (But if virus variants discovered in the UK that appear more transmissive spread widely in the US, that could complicate efforts of curbing spread, even if the vaccine is just as effective against these variants.)

If all goes fairly well with the logistics of vaccine distribution, it will take weeks to months for it to actually start reducing hospitalizations and fatalities from Covid-19.

A vaccine is meant to prevent illness, so it will do little for people who are already ill with Covid-19. And the SARS-CoV-2 virus can incubate in a person for up to two weeks before the individual starts to show symptoms, and it can take longer after that for them to seek treatment.

As such, there will be a lag in seeing the impacts of a vaccine across the population. But slowing the spread of the virus would make vaccines a more powerful tool to end the pandemic, and results would start to manifest much sooner. Vaccination is also going to be working in tandem with immunity people have built up from surviving infection. Almost 20 million people in the US have been infected to date. “Around 30 percent population immunity, things start slowing a little bit, especially in the places that have been hit hard,” Jha said.

Conversely, if Covid-19 continues to rage out of control, it will be much harder for a vaccine to make a difference in morbidity and mortality, and it will take even longer to see results.

We still need testing, masking, distancing, and treatments

While scientists and health experts have been elated at the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, they’ve also been adamant that vaccines on their own are not enough to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

The existing measures for slowing Covid-19 remain just as important as they’ve ever been, if not more so, given that hospitalizations and daily deaths are continuing to mount. Tactics like wearing face masks, rigorous hand-washing, and avoiding large gatherings and close contact with others will still be needed in the coming months, even among people who have been immunized.

Treatments for Covid-19 are also critical since they are the most immediate way to reduce fatalities. Approaches like monoclonal antibodies will be needed to help people survive the illness.

Widespread testing for Covid-19 will also continue to be crucial to identify potential spreaders and to allow people in key jobs to continue working.

It’s a sliding scale between these variables. For example, better testing and tracing could allow people more freedom even if they are not immune. Or effective treatments can drastically reduce fatality rates, reducing the burden of the disease.

However, pressure on all fronts — vaccines, treatment, testing, social distancing — is what will end the crisis the soonest. “The vaccine works at a population level a lot faster if we’re introducing it into a context into which we are throwing all of our other methods to interrupt the virus,” Fitzpatrick said.

In addition to vaccinating millions of people, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical. Efforts to contain the virus will allow the vaccine to have a much greater impact. Vaccines could be targeted to hot spots, for instance, rather than having to push back against a national onslaught.

As mentioned earlier, curtailing the virus’s transmission also reduces the likelihood of a mutation that could render a vaccine less effective. (But if virus variants discovered in the UK that appear more transmissive spread widely in the US, that could complicate efforts of curbing spread, even if the vaccine is just as effective against these variants.)

If all goes fairly well with the logistics of vaccine distribution, it will take weeks to months for it to actually start reducing hospitalizations and fatalities from Covid-19.

A vaccine is meant to prevent illness, so it will do little for people who are already ill with Covid-19. And the SARS-CoV-2 virus can incubate in a person for up to two weeks before the individual starts to show symptoms, and it can take longer after that for them to seek treatment.

As such, there will be a lag in seeing the impacts of a vaccine across the population. But slowing the spread of the virus would make vaccines a more powerful tool to end the pandemic, and results would start to manifest much sooner. Vaccination is also going to be working in tandem with immunity people have built up from surviving infection. Almost 20 million people in the US have been infected to date. “Around 30 percent population immunity, things start slowing a little bit, especially in the places that have been hit hard,” Jha said.

Conversely, if Covid-19 continues to rage out of control, it will be much harder for a vaccine to make a difference in morbidity and mortality, and it will take even longer to see results.

We still need testing, masking, distancing, and treatments

While scientists and health experts have been elated at the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, they’ve also been adamant that vaccines on their own are not enough to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

The existing measures for slowing Covid-19 remain just as important as they’ve ever been, if not more so, given that hospitalizations and daily deaths are continuing to mount. Tactics like wearing face masks, rigorous hand-washing, and avoiding large gatherings and close contact with others will still be needed in the coming months, even among people who have been immunized.

Treatments for Covid-19 are also critical since they are the most immediate way to reduce fatalities. Approaches like monoclonal antibodies will be needed to help people survive the illness.

Widespread testing for Covid-19 will also continue to be crucial to identify potential spreaders and to allow people in key jobs to continue working.

It’s a sliding scale between these variables. For example, better testing and tracing could allow people more freedom even if they are not immune. Or effective treatments can drastically reduce fatality rates, reducing the burden of the disease.

However, pressure on all fronts — vaccines, treatment, testing, social distancing — is what will end the crisis the soonest. “The vaccine works at a population level a lot faster if we’re introducing it into a context into which we are throwing all of our other methods to interrupt the virus,” Fitzpatrick said.

While millions of people are growing weary of all the drastic restrictions imposed by the pandemic and the efforts to contain it, keeping them up in the coming months will help ensure that the US finds the quickest and least painful way out of routines bound by Covid-19.",voxdotcom,"['affect', 'population', 'sarscov2', 'really', 'virus', 'covid19', 'major', 'unknowns', 'vaccine', 'protection', 'health', 'spread', 'pandemic', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-28 14:59:39+00:00,12,"A new, seemingly more contagious variety of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — that has been spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom has now been found in the United States in at least two locations.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced December 30 that the new strain, known as B.1.1.7 (we’ll call it the UK variant, for simplicity’s sake), was detected in the southern part of the state. It’s the second report of the UK variant in the US in as many days, following news that the variant was found in a male Colorado National Guard member in his 20s with no history of travel, a sign that the virus is spreading locally.

“There is a lot we don’t know about this COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement.

The evidence that this new strain spreads more easily between people is not rock solid, but it’s concerning enough to have forced dramatic action, like shutting down travel from the United Kingdom earlier this month. But it wasn’t enough: The variant has now been detected in Canada, Spain, Sweden, France, and Italy, among others.

At the moment, it doesn’t appear as though the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 is more dangerous in individuals. It doesn’t seem to make people sicker, nor is it more likely to kill them. “I think the key point is that there is no evidence now … that this virus is more pathogenic — creates more problems, more morbidity and mortality — than the previous virus,” Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, said during a December 21 press conference.

What it does appear to do, at least based on preliminary evidence, is spread more quickly among people. That alone is a problem: The coronavirus spreads fast enough as it is. Compounding concerns is that the UK variant echoes a similar story in South Africa, where a strain called 501.V2 has become the dominant version among new cases of the virus. Scientists are wondering whether that strain is more transmissible, too.

The virus has been continually changing its genetics through the course of the pandemic. That’s what RNA-based viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do — they mutate. Most of the time, the mutations mean nothing. But this time, something is different.

“I’ve spent a lot of time this year reminding people that mutations are normal,” molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, who works on a project called Nextstrain, said. For the entire pandemic, scientists around the world have been collecting genetic information about SARS-CoV-2 in a public database called GISAID. Hodcroft and her colleagues at Nextstrain draw on this database to closely track genetic changes in the virus.

In the past, mutations haven’t warranted big newspaper headlines. “I’m now finding myself singing a slightly different tune,” Hodcroft said. This time, there does seem to be evidence that the new strain is something worth being vigilant about. “We probably should consider taking some precautionary measures while we’re trying to find out more,” she added.

At the same time, Covid-19 is surging around the world, even without these new mutations. Scientists are still trying to figure out what these new variants of the coronavirus actually mean for the pandemic. It’s also unclear where else the UK variant may have already spread, aside from the countries where it has been detected. While it was reported in the US only this week, it could have been in the country for much longer. “The variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported December 22.

The good news is that we already know how to respond to these new variants: in the same way we’ve been responding to the pandemic overall. The virus still transmits primarily through viral-laden breaths in the air. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and good indoor ventilation are as critical as ever.

There’s a lot about this story that’s potentially very alarming or confusing. And the story is not yet complete, as scientists need more evidence to understand whether these new variants pose a new threat.

To add some clarity, here’s what researchers have learned so far. Let’s start with the basics.

Viral mutations, explained

Viral mutations. New strains. Increased transmission. It all sounds like scary science fiction. But to demystify things, and to understand why scientists are a little concerned about this new variant — and why most variants don’t faze them — it’s worth understanding how viruses mutate in the first place.

“Oftentimes, I think the word mutation in general conjures up a lot of things in people’s minds, like, you know, Ninja Turtles or X-Men or cancer, like zombie apocalypse-type stuff,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said. “A mutation is just a lot more mundane than that.”

Viruses mutate because they’re constantly making copies of themselves in enormous numbers. To accomplish this, they have to hijack the hardware of a host cell that they infect. However, this process can be a bit sloppy.

Within a human body, a virus can replicate itself millions or billions of times, Hodcroft explains. If you were writing a draft of something millions of times on a computer, extremely quickly, you’d probably make some typos. That’s what’s happening with the viruses. “They make a typo” in their genetic code, she says. One letter of their ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain is replaced with another.

Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, like SARS-CoV-2, are particularly vulnerable to mutations since the RNA molecule itself is more unstable than DNA. The process of copying RNA is also more prone to error.

These typos can be very useful for scientists because they happen at a regular rate, and are passed down through generations of the virus as it spreads through a community. Often, scientists can use these subtle changes to trace certain strains’ lineage and their spread through a population.

The majority of these typos are inconsequential when it comes to human health. “One typo, or even a few typos, doesn’t usually change how the virus works,” Hodcroft says. Some even harm the virus. “You’re much more likely to break it than to make it better” when it comes to mutations, she says.

But in rare instances, some mutations can give a virus an advantage, like allowing it to infect cells more readily or spread among people faster. Those mutant strains can then become dominant within a population.

That might be what we’re looking at here with the UK variant; this new strain may have accumulated typos that could make it more easily transmitted between people.

Four lines of evidence converging on this new mutation being more transmissible

So why do scientists think this variant is more transmissible?

They don’t have this nailed down yet for sure, but four converging streams of evidence are all pointing in the same direction. “That’s making people feel like maybe there is something here to be worried about,” Hodcroft says. “Each one of these things on their own, I would say is not necessarily convincing.” But all together, they paint a concerning picture.

One is that in the areas of the UK where this new variant is spreading, it is accounting for a larger proportion of new cases. “What this implies is that this new variant is spreading better than other variants that are circulating in the same region,” she says.

National testing data shows increased prevalence of the variant in positive cases over time. This is detected incidentally by the commonly used 3-gene PCR test because 69-70del leads to a negative signal. But this does not effect the results of the test. 7/

A second is that the increase didn’t co-occur with any overly obvious change in human behavior. “We don’t really have strong evidence that everyone in the southeast [UK where this variant is spreading] has just ripped their masks off and is, you know, totally violating restrictions,” she says. That said, it could be a coincidence. It could be just that people who happen to have contracted this variant have it are spreading it more often via their behavior.

After all, “this new variant has emerged at a time of the year when there has traditionally been increased family and social mixing,” according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which estimated that the transmissibility of the new variant has increased by 70 percent compared to prior versions of the virus. Both Rasmussen and Hodcroft say the 70 percent more transmissible figure is most likely an overestimate. A recent, not yet peer-reviewed study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine used a mathematical model to estimate that the new strain may be 56 percent more infectious.

Third, there’s some early data about how this variant acts in Covid-19 patients. “There may be slightly higher viral loads in patients with the variants,” Hodcroft says, suggesting the virus has an easier time replicating in the body. (Viral load refers to the amount of virus in the patient. Rasmussen also cautions that viral load data is really sensitive to timing and when the patient was sampled in the course of the illness, so there needs to be more data to confirm this.)

Finally, the genetic changes in the UK variant mirror changes in the South African variant, which has also been associated with rising case numbers. That makes a plausible link: that this particular genetic change may be behind the increased transmissibility in both variants.

However, this is still short of definitive confirmation that the new variant is more transmissible.

According to Slaoui, figuring this out for certain would require laboratory animal testing to see how easily the virus can spread from one organism to another. But this testing can take several weeks.

In the face of that uncertainty, many urge caution.

Again, there’s still no evidence this new variant causes more severe disease. The evidence points only to increased transmissibility. But a more transmissible virus is still a concern. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Hodcroft says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

What does the mutation ... do?

The UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 actually contains 23 mutations in the genome of the virus. “We don’t really know what they do,” Rasmussen says. Individually, many of these mutations have already been seen in other strains of the virus around the world. But the combination of these changes in a single virus could be making the new variant more likely to spread.

However, scientists do think that some mutations may be more important than others, and there are several mechanisms by which mutations could make the virus more infectious. Those include:

1. The virus could end up with changes to its spike protein that allow it to enter cells more easily.

2. The virus could develop a mechanism to replicate more quickly inside a body, which would lead “to people becoming infectious faster, or contagious faster than they would with another variant,” Rasmussen explains.

3. The virus could theoretically have evolved an ability to counteract the cell’s innate immune defenses, making it easier to infect that cell.

One of the pathways scientists suspect may be at work stems from the N501Y mutation, where the amino acid asparagine is replaced by the amino acid tyrosine in the 501st position of the viral protein sequence. It’s one of several mutations in the virus’s spike protein in the UK variant, but N501Y is in the part of the spike that actually comes into direct contact with human cells. The same mutation has been found in the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 that’s also quickly spreading.

Since the virus attaching to a host cell is critical to the virus’s reproduction, the virus’s spike protein is especially important — and delicate.

“If you were just making random changes in the lab, almost any change you make in that area would result in just a dead virus that can no longer get into the cell,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University Texarkana. “That fact that this thing is able to spread at all tells you that it’s at least as good as the original version. The fact that it’s spreading faster may indicate that it’s a little bit better at grabbing on to host cells, which is the first step of the entry process.”

But this particular N501Y mutation has already been detected in strains that have risen and fallen in other parts of the world over the course of the pandemic. So it may be that the other mutations coupled with N501Y are having some sort of compounding effect. And scientists still need to do more work to determine if this is actually what’s causing the rise of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Finding out the answer could help researchers come up with ways to counter this variety of the coronavirus.

How did these coronavirus mutations happen?

Scientists don’t know exactly how the UK variant came to be. But there may be a clue. Hodcroft is struck by the sheer number of mutations in the UK variant — 23 in all — which makes her suspect it’s possible this variant arose in an immunocompromised person. “It’s an above-average number of mutations,” she says.

In most people, she explains, the immune system mounts a full-on assault on the virus, eliminating it in a matter of a couple of weeks. “In people that have compromised immune systems, though, there’s a very different dynamic,” she says. “So, for one thing, the virus could be in them for months instead of weeks.” That gives the virus more time to evolve, to accumulate mutations that might make it easier to thwart the immune system.

“It’s one scenario,” she says. “We may never know exactly what happened here.”

The basic truth: The more this virus spreads, the more chances there are for dangerous new variants to emerge. In any person — or animal, for that matter — the chance for a dangerous new variant to arise is rare. But rare things can happen when there are so many cases: more than 80 million confirmed cases worldwide.

Since viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are mutating and since Covid-19 has spread in so many people, it’s theoretically only a matter of time before a certain set of mutations align in a way to give the virus a boost.

What can we do about Covid-19 mutants?

To stop mutations, quite simply, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Rasmussen says. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

We fight the new variant as we would any variant of SARS-CoV-2: with masks, with social distancing, with good hand hygiene. “I don’t think people should be panicking,” Hodcroft says. “Lower case numbers, no matter what the variant, are better.”

It’s already been said but if we actually follow protocol and have policies that support those protocols a new variant that is more transmissible would be combatted just as an older variant. So like worry less about mutants and more about masking and distancing and vaccination. — K. Taylor, Ph.D., M.S. (@KYT_ThatsME) December 21, 2020

Scientists have one more tool, though: genetic tracking. At Nextstrain, Hodcroft and her colleagues receive viral genetic sequences from all over the world to try to paint a real-time picture of transmission chains and keep tabs on how the virus is changing. But not every place in the world is providing the same amount of data.

The UK does a lot of viral sequencing, for instance. It was able to pick up on the new viral strain quickly because of that. In other locations around the globe, that might not have happened so fast.

“In the US, it’s a really spotty picture,” Hodcroft says when it comes to sequencing. “Some states have really invested in sequencing; some states haven’t. So for some states, we probably have a fair idea of what’s going on. In other states, we really don’t have many sequences.”

Overall, the CDC reports that the US has sequenced only 51,000 of the more than 17 million cases reported in the country. That’s 0.07 percent. In comparison, the UK aims to sequence 10,000 virus samples per week, and plans to increase that capacity further. (In addition: The UK sequences the genomes faster than the US, according to infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford.) That lack of viral genetic testing creates a big blind spot in the US. The UK variant could have already arrived here undetected “given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced,” the CDC states.

More sequencing, overall, would lead to the faster detection of new strains and faster means to contain them if they were deemed problematic.

Do mutations mean a Covid-19 vaccine won’t work anymore?

With new mutations, there is a concern that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 could arise that would be different enough from previous versions such that prior exposures — whether through a vaccine or an infection — won’t offer protection. So, yes, it’s possible that the coronavirus could someday mutate in a way that would elude a vaccine or previous immunity.

Right now, though, scientists think this UK variant would still fall under the same umbrella of protection as earlier strains. If someone received a Covid-19 vaccine for an older generation of the virus, they would likely have protection against this one.

To explain why, it helps to understand how the immune system deals with viruses. When the human body detects a hostile foreign entity like a virus, it starts to produce antibodies (proteins that attach to the virus or to infected cells). Antibodies can then interfere with how the virus works. They can also flag the virus or virus-infected cells for destruction by other immune cells.

The specific places where the antibodies attach to the virus are called epitopes, and most Covid-19 vaccines target epitopes on the virus’s spike protein (which is what the virus uses to attach to human cells and enter them).

“The good thing with the vaccine is that it induces an immune response against several epitopes that have been mapped around the spike protein,” Slaoui said. “The chances that one set of mutations would alter all those epitopes, I think, are extremely very low. The expectation, scientifically, is that these kinds of variations are unlikely to escape fully the protective response by the vaccine.”

More good news: Scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch have announced (via a tweet) preliminary evidence that antibodies that neutralize the more common strain of the virus also neutralize a strain with the N501Y mutation (the one that impacts the part of the virus that comes into direct contact with human cells, as mentioned above). That suggests that an immune system primed — by a natural infection, at least — to fight the old variant can also fight one with this specific mutation.

Some good news (and incredibly fast work) on one of the mutations scientists are worried about: N501Y.

In these lab experiments serum from recovered #covid19 patients was just as good at neutralizing virus with the mutation as without it. https://t.co/SIxfo2x3qp — Kai Kupferschmidt (@kakape) December 22, 2020

Texas A&M’s Neuman noted that there’s also evidence right now showing how well vaccines can protect against mutated forms of the virus in clinical trials. Many of the vaccines being administered were engineered to counter the earliest generations of SARS-CoV-2 but are still showing themselves to be highly effective against Covid-19 caused by more recent versions of the virus.

“All the tests are being done, all the papers being published, are being done with current strains, which have several mutations relative to [the first iterations of the virus], and it does still seem to be working,” Neuman said.

Covid-19 vaccine developers say they are keeping a close eye on these changes and testing to make sure their vaccines are still effective. “In terms of the new variant, Pfizer and BioNTech are monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequence changes and the companies are working to generate data on how well serum from people immunized with [the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine] may be able to neutralize the new strain,” said a Pfizer spokesperson via email.

And the new Covid-19 vaccines are well equipped to adapt. The two that have received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration — the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine — both use mRNA as their platform. These vaccines deliver the instructions for making the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Those human cells then manufacture the component themselves, allowing the immune system to use it to prepare for an infection. One huge advantage of this approach is that the mRNA sequence can be altered quickly; the first such vaccines for Covid-19 were developed within days after the genetic sequence of the virus was posted online.

Could manufacturers like Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech then retool their vaccines to target the new variants without going through the whole tedious clinical trial process again?

Possibly, according to Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA and a professor of medicine at Georgetown University. He told Vox that vaccines for new variants of the influenza virus are approved every year without large-scale trials. New versions of a Covid-19 vaccine to accommodate mutations similarly might not need another round of study in tens of thousands of people, but may require some testing to figure out dosing and immune response. With such a new virus and brand new vaccines, the regulations for these situations have not yet been laid out.

Should we expect more mutations in the future?

Short answer: yes.

The UK and South African variants are unlikely to be the last to make headlines. Coronavirus is constantly evolving. We should expect it to keep changing slightly.

“There will be new variants that emerge,” Rasmussen says. The thing is, with each new significant strain, scientists will have to do careful work to determine whether it’s more dangerous.

And there are some mutations we can perhaps even expect — if not in the coming weeks, over the next several years.

Recently, virology researchers at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center published a preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) study, looking at how a coronavirus that causes the common cold evolved from the 1980s onward. To accomplish that, they got old blood samples, which included antibodies that cling to this particular virus. They also reconstructed pieces of the cold virus from other eras. Basically, they wanted to see if older blood could still neutralize newer virus. If it couldn’t, that would indicate the virus has evolved over time to evade the immune system.

Here’s what the researchers found: “This other human coronavirus does indeed evolve over the course of multiple years to gradually escape human immunity,” Jesse Bloom, a virologist who co-authored the study, says. “So we think this suggests that there’s the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to do the same thing.” But Bloom stresses that this process takes years. It’s enough time to prepare, to monitor, and to potentially tweak vaccine formulations to keep up with the virus’s evolution.

It’s not like the virus can evolve into an entirely different beast. “It can mutate to maybe escape antibodies,” Rachel Eguia, the study’s lead author, says. But it can’t change so much that it alters its ability to enter cells.

Scientists are also keeping their eyes out for a rapid, major mutation event known as recombination. That’s where an individual is infected with two different strains of the virus at the same time, allowing the virus strains to swap parts. These new viruses could then evade the antibodies that targeted their predecessors. Some researchers think that recombination might be how SARS-CoV-2 originated in the first place.

“This is all hypothetical in this particular virus, but it happens in other viruses all the time,” Neuman said.

Faced with these looming challenges, reducing the transmission of the coronavirus in general is still the best way to protect the fragile progress made in the Covid-19 pandemic so far. Reducing transmissions is also one of the best ways to make sure powerful tools like vaccines remain potent for as long as possible. The fact that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are coming out is not a cause for complacency, and these new variants of SARS-CoV-2 highlight how important it is to remain vigilant.

Share All sharing options for: The pandemic could have crushed WeWork. It may have saved it instead.

Last year, WeWork failed to become a public company after a high-profile implosion full of intrigue, excess, and downright foolishness. Miraculously, one year and one pandemic later, the coworking company is not only still kicking, but it stands to ride post-Covid-19 office trends to profitability and an IPO — if it can hold on long enough.

A company that rents out trendy shared and private office space, WeWork has made a number of critical changes that have helped it hold on while facing a pandemic that kept people home and away from offices. Some of the most important changes, however, happened before the coronavirus took hold.

Last year, the company ditched its founder, Adam Neumann, who had created a company culture that was more in line with the most outrageous tech company than something as quotidian as real estate. As he sought a tech company valuation for the office subleasing company, Neumann’s hard partying, profligate spending, and poor judgment derailed that goal and nearly destroyed the company. A new CEO, Sandeep Mathrani, took over this February and was charged with righting the company’s mission, cutting costs, and excising a destructive company culture in order to bring the once highly valued unicorn back from the brink.

WeWork’s upheaval meant that the company was already forced to be agile in order to avoid destruction before the pandemic. But the company’s perseverance is also a testament to the strength of the flexible office market, a real estate sector that focuses on short leases and move-in-ready space, in addition to coworking. Indeed, so-called flexible office space has proved surprisingly hardy during the pandemic, given that its business had been predicated, in part, on the idea of squeezing as many people into as little square footage as possible.

With the arrival of a vaccine, those issues are seeming less important. Meanwhile, flexible space’s value proposition is looking more attractive for companies trying to contend with the uncertainty of a more dispersed workforce spending more of their days at home.

“We believe, based on our data and history, that flex is going to be a very viable alternative when interest in office space rebounds,” Julie Whelan, global head of occupier research at the commercial real estate firm CBRE, said in a recent briefing about flexible office space. “It will come out of this stronger than it went in.”

So to comprehend WeWork’s remarkable recovery, you need to know more about flexible office space and its prospects.

Why flexible office space has a future

There’s no getting around the fact that the pandemic has been rough on owners and operators of office space, including flexible space, which people can get rid of more easily. Only a small portion of people have returned to the office. In Manhattan, the biggest office market, just 10 percent of office workers have come back, and some may never do so.

But while new leases are down, few are relinquishing flexible office space. The amount of leased flexible office space in the top 23 US markets was 67.1 million square feet at the end of the third quarter this year, according to the commercial real estate services giant Cushman & Wakefield, up 2.5 percent from where it was at the end of 2019.

WeWork and its competitors like Knotel and Industrious — all of which lease ready-to-use office space to individuals and companies — have slowed their rapid growth but haven’t had to downsize much. They’ve retained enough business to keep them afloat during the pandemic and are looking forward to a time when their flexible space is more attractive than regular long-term office leases. Industrious says it thinks it will max out on fitting new customers into its existing space next year.

The attraction to flexible office space is that businesses can more easily adjust to trends like the hybrid office, in which people go into the office less often and for different reasons than they used to. They also provide a stopover for companies still trying to figure out what the future will bring.

Real estate experts say that rather than shying away from the space, companies — especially big ones — are planning to increase their flexible space footprints and making it a bigger part of their portfolio in the future. Some 86 percent of companies plan to use flexible space as a key part of their real estate strategies in the future, according to a report by CBRE that surveyed about 80 companies around the globe. They’re also highly likely to favor leasing in buildings that have flexible space offerings.

JLL, a commercial real estate services company, predicts that 30 percent of all office space will be flexible by 2030.

Jonathan Wasserstrum, CEO of the digital commercial real estate brokerage SquareFoot, thinks it could happen sooner. Demand for flexible options on his platform increased 15 percent in 2020. The reasons for the move to flexible space are myriad, and in general, they represent an acceleration of trends apparent before the pandemic.

Surprisingly, real estate experts don’t think that shared space will be as scary in the future as it’s been during the pandemic, thanks to widespread adoption of safety measures and, perhaps more importantly, a vaccine on the way.

“Anyone who manages an office environment, including flexible space providers, has been tasked with putting protocols in place to increase safety at work, such as air filtration, social distancing, enhanced cleaning, mask usage, etc.,” CBRE’s Whelan said. “As long as safety protocols are in place and followed, we don’t see flexible space being different than other types of office space.”

In fact, the pandemic has made such space more attractive.

“For corporate occupiers considering spacing needs, having flexibility is exactly what they would want because of things like this pandemic,” Paul Leonard, a managing consultant at CoStar Advisory Services, told Recode.

That is, if something bad happens, companies want to be able to relinquish their rental expenses more quickly than if they signed a traditional office lease. They’re willing to pay a premium to mitigate uncertainty.

But the main reason for wanting more flexible space, according to the CBRE survey, is to provide places for companies’ increasingly mobile workforce to work. Going forward, most companies plan on adopting a so-called hybrid model where some of their employees work from home some of the time. The rest of the time, they’ll need office space. Flexible space helps accommodate office space in a wider variety of locations to reflect a dispersed workforce. It can also more easily be acquired and relinquished than traditional office space.

Flexible space is ascendant as businesses are reconsidering the purpose of the office, according to David Smith, Americas head of occupier research at Cushman & Wakefield.

“Instead of having just an office space, we’ll have a workplace ecosystem,” Smith told Recode. That means people may not go to a main office every day by default, but instead go there “more for learning development, collaborating, mentoring, socializing.”

In other words, businesses still need office space, but they need it for different reasons than they used to. Offices for many will function as a welcome reprieve from working from home, especially for people with roommates or children or too-small apartments. And companies like WeWork are uniquely positioned to provide office space for people and companies not quite sure what the future will hold.

WeWork’s miraculous turnaround

No one could’ve predicted that WeWork would still be at the forefront of office trends in 2020. Its new path to profitability and perhaps even a public listing is especially extraordinary considering how bad things were and how far it fell in the past few years.

Though it’s a tech company in name only, WeWork had once been a Silicon Valley darling with a lofty valuation of $47 billion and the biggest banks tripping over themselves to help make it a public company. But the process of going public brought to light the company’s shocking financial mishaps and cultural ethos.

The year before it intended to go public, the company was losing $1.6 billion on $1.8 billion in revenue. Losing money is nothing new for tech startups, but those losses were the product of even larger issues about corporate governance and bad behavior.

As the company struggled to prove its value to potential public shareholders, its co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann surfed, missed meetings, and enriched himself and his family with company money. There were drugs, alleged sexual assault, and a “spa and ice bath” attached to Neumann’s office. He also spent ridiculous amounts of money on investments that had nothing to do with WeWork — which he needlessly renamed the We Company — including a school and a wave pool.

It turned out that the public markets were less amenable to this behavior than the private investors had been.

In late 2019, the company canceled its public offering and fired Neumann, who got a giant $1.7 billion exit package to leave the company he drove into the ground. SoftBank, its main investor, lost billions on the company and set about trying to rescue it. That included cutting spending, slowing its new real estate investments, and reconsidering the ones it already had. It fired thousands of employees and divested from non-core businesses, including the wave pool. It also hired Mathrani, a more moderate executive known for turning companies around. And finally, the We Company changed its name back to WeWork.

While the company isn’t out of the woods, it has managed to get back on the right path. WeWork has already halved the amount of money it’s losing from $1.2 billion in the third quarter of last year to a still large but more manageable $500 million this year. Its membership and revenue are down, but they’re down less than 15 percent from last year. That’s not so bad when you consider that many of WeWork’s members have monthly subscriptions and can cancel any time.

Additionally, a growing share of its memberships — 54 percent versus 43 percent last year — is coming from enterprise companies that have 500 or more employees. These companies sometimes lease whole floors or buildings and are more valuable and stable than individual memberships.

The company has also added some revenue lines that actually make sense. In October, the company launched Business Solutions to help small and medium businesses in its spaces handle things like human resources and payroll. Businesses will pay a monthly subscription fee for access to these services, in addition to what they pay for rent.

“This is really moving [WeWork] from not just a space company but really offering end-to-end business solutions,” Prabhdeep Singh, WeWork’s global head of marketplace, told Yahoo Finance in October. “I wouldn’t say this is the final grand vision and plan, but this is the first step.”

It also added in-office advertising to allow advertisers to reach its business clientele through the thousands of screens within WeWork offices.

The challenges ahead

WeWork has fixed some major flaws and is in a promising industry, but that doesn’t mean it’s assured success. The company is going to face some severe challenges before the pandemic is over.

WeWork generally operates by leasing space in buildings or entire buildings from landlords, and retrofitting that space to make it look like a hip startup office. It then subleases desks, offices, or even entire floors or buildings to individuals and companies, who pay much more than WeWork pays for it. One challenge is that WeWork signed many of those leases with landlords at the top of the market before the pandemic, when rents were at their highest. But the company is subleasing them now when people expect to pay less for office rent since there is more available and we’re in a recession. Newer locations are also less likely to be fully occupied, since it takes a while to fill them with tenants, so they’re bringing in less total rent than mature locations do. In other words, for its newer locations, WeWork is paying more and bringing in less.

One of WeWork’s biggest competitors, Industrious, has foresworn leases in exchange for revenue shares with building owners. That means instead of paying rent, it gives landlords a share of its revenue for about 80 percent of its portfolio. That arrangement allowed it to actually expand into new locations during the pandemic. It also let it minimize losses, since bringing in less revenue meant it had to pay out less as well. CBRE says to expect more of these types of arrangements in the future.

Additionally, building owners themselves are getting into the coworking and flexible office space, meaning they could knock out intermediaries like WeWork.

Finally, a large portion of WeWork’s business does come from traditional coworking, with many people using shared workspaces. It remains to be seen if people prefer private offices within flexible space after the pandemic is over. For now, WeWork has to make it through the rest of the pandemic if it’s going to continue to be a major contender in the flexible office space.

2020-12-27 15:09:02+00:00,41,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-12-23 16:50:10+00:00,8,"The Trump administration is nearing a deal to procure tens of millions more Covid-19 vaccine doses from the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, Sharon LaFraniere and Katie Thomas reported for the New York Times on Tuesday.

The deal would reportedly give Pfizer, through a government directive, better access to supplies it needs to manufacture more vaccine doses. Pfizer would then leverage those supplies to pump out much-needed vaccines to Americans, helping fill gaps the country faces in the coming months as the vaccine process gets underway.

If successful, the deal could produce up to 100 million additional doses from April through June. That’d be enough to cover 50 million Americans, because the vaccine requires two doses to be fully effective.

Only two vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech’s and Moderna’s, have so far passed through sufficient clinical trials to earn emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. More vaccines are expected to roll out in the coming months as well.

But Pfizer has reportedly run into some problems with the federal government. The Times reported:

Pfizer first started asking for the government’s help in obtaining supplies as early as September and has been unhappy about the lack of response, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Moderna and other companies that worked more closely than Pfizer with the administration through its Operation Warp Speed to develop their vaccines already receive favored treatment from suppliers, putting Pfizer at a disadvantage. That includes two companies — Sanofi and Novavax — that have yet to begin large-scale clinical trials in the United States.

Overcoming these kinds of hurdles is one of two major challenges the US faces as it rolls out a vaccine, according to experts. The first challenge is solving these kinds of logistical hurdles in producing, shipping, and actually administering vaccines to hopefully more than 300 million people. The second is to actually persuade all those people to take a vaccine — which is not guaranteed, given polling showing some hesitancy from as many as half of Americans.

How the country deals with these challenges, under President Donald Trump now and President-elect Joe Biden in the coming months, will dictate just how quickly America defeats the coronavirus — whether that process takes through the summer, or extends potentially into 2022.

It’s not an easy job. As Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security senior scholar Crystal Watson told me, “This is going to be the largest mass vaccination campaign that the US has ever attempted.”

America is among the poorest-faring countries on Covid-19. More than 320,000 Americans have died due to the coronavirus so far. Despite recent surges in Europe, the US remains within the top 25 percent for most coronavirus deaths per million people among developed nations, with more than twice the death rate as the median developed country. If the US managed the same Covid-19 death rate as Canada, nearly 200,000 Americans would likely be alive today.

The US is currently seeing record numbers of cases and deaths, with more than 215,000 cases and 2,700 deaths reported, on average, per day. Until a Covid-19 vaccine reaches the bulk of Americans, experts say the country must renew and scale up social distancing and masking to mitigate the spread of the disease. Otherwise, the high case count and death toll will continue.

That’s where more vaccine doses could come in: If they speed up the process of getting more of the country vaccinated by even a few days, they could not only let the country get back to normal quicker but prevent hundreds of thousands of cases and save potentially thousands of lives.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'administration', 'supplies', 'work', 'americans', 'covid19', 'times', 'vaccine', 'millions', 'doses', 'pfizer', 'deal', 'million', 'tens', 'country', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-23 15:53:09+00:00,5,"He’s making a list, he’s checking it twice — and it’s probably going to include hand sanitizer, face masks, and extra gloves. Not even Santa Claus is exempt from the struggles of 2020, despite the Trump administration’s attempt to get him early vaccine access, and Dr. Anthony Fauci’s assurance to American children that he has “innate immunity.”

While some retailers, like Macy’s, have nixed in-person Santa visits altogether, others, from mall operator Brookfield Properties to Bass Pro Shops, are adapting to meet safety guidelines by putting Santa behind plexiglass or offering families the chance to share their Christmas lists with him on video chat.

Pandemic-era Santa visits have even spawned a whole cottage industry, from JingleRing, a new platform designed to simplify virtual Santa visits, to plastic snow globe tents. The Goods called four Santas — from The Real Black Santa, who’s learning a new virtual system in order to reach a wider audience, to an adults-only Santa figuring out how to translate his raunchy humor to Zoom parties — to hear how they’re approaching the 2020 Christmas season.

The Plexiglass Santa: Chip Adams, 62, East Hartford, Connecticut

At Cabela’s here — and I believe it’s true chain-wide — they have a three-eighths inch, about 6-by-6 foot piece of plexiglass between us and the guests. Santa wears a face shield as well. When folks sit down for photos, they can take their masks off. Since I’m behind the plexiglass and a face shield, that makes me feel comfortable. It’s a pretty wide-open space, there’s a lot of air circulation. After every guest, the elves wipe down the seat, and every hour they wipe down the plexiglass.

It hurts when somebody brings up a 4-month-old baby because we can’t hold them — that’s one of the parts I think we all have difficulty with. But I’ll tell you, last night I had a 5-year-old boy. As he approached Santa, he started to run, full speed. And he kind of leapt and smacked into the plexiglass. As soon as I realized what was happening, I put my hand up and I steadied the plexiglass so there was no chance of him knocking it over. He looked like a cartoon — his nose went a little flat, his eyes were wide open, his hands were out, arms wide open, thinking he was gonna get to Santa. And he almost slid down a little bit. Then he shook it off and laughed and sat down and got his picture taken.

Some of the guys are experimenting with baby monitors. So we can put a baby monitor on [the guest’s] side that nobody touches, but we can hear the kids talking. We’re trying that out just to see if we can help because some of the kids are so soft-spoken. It’s a little harder to joke around with the kids, but they get it. I mean, one of the sad things is watching how comfortable these children are zipping their masks on and off. I think what people need to focus on is what you can do, not what you can’t do. If you worry about what you can’t do, that’ll just ruin the holiday.

The Virtual-Only Santa: Dee Sinclair, 56, Covington, Georgia

The virtual studio for me was not new. My company, The Real Black Santa, has been in business 19 years now, so it was easy for us to go virtual because we had the backdrop and the lighting, all the things that were necessary, from doing mall visits. The hardest part about it was learning the computer system OBS, which is what a lot of gamers use, and doing it through Zoom or Skype. With JingleRing, they have a proprietary platform that we’re using. Basically you just need a blue or green screen backdrop, and you get working. They brought me on as a brand ambassador, so they’ve got me doing videos for the company, and I’m also trying to get additional Santas to come on board.

[Online], it’s still that same greeting that you have when you’re in the mall. But the good thing about it is Santa is actually calling you from his workshop. If they hear noise in the background, those are the elves, making toys. Mom and Dad have already given us some detailed information about what the kids got for Christmas the year before, how they were performing in school, you know, are they helping at home. As a Santa, you have to be a better performer, and know how to talk to somebody as if they were standing in front of you.

Most guys who are doing Santa — we’re a little older. We’re in that category where we’re overweight, a lot of the guys are diabetic, have heart problems, and so forth. It’s hard for us not to be in front of the kids. And though I want to be out there doing events, I don’t want to be behind a partition while kids are in front of me. I think that’s more impersonal than not being there. And I’d hate to sit in front of 20 kids, and I have something or contract something and pass it on to somebody else.

I have a lot of clients that are still calling wanting us to do in-person visits right now. And as much as I want to, I’m shying away from it. Usually, the day after Christmas I’m getting event bookings for the following year. I had to cancel the ones that we’ve already booked. So yeah, this definitely is a hit on the pocket.

The Home-Visit Santa: Willie Williamson, 66, Marietta, Georgia

I’ve been working with my clients to determine what they’re expecting from Santa; some of them want Santa with the mask, some of them don’t. l show up at the residence, we’ll social distance, and then when we get ready to take pictures, I’ll get seated and then the kids will back up into me so that we’re not facing each other. Once the pictures are over, if they want to have a one-on-one with Santa, then I’ll put a mask on.

I’ve had 14 different masks made by a local seamstress, with snowflakes and reindeer and that kind of thing. I’ve bought tons of sanitizer, so I’m sanitizing before and after each visit. I bought an extra four dozen gloves, so I’ll change my gloves after every visit. I went ahead and bought two more suits this year, which will give me seven so I can change my suit every day of the week. I’ve got a UVB light set up in a closet, and I can also sanitize them that way.

My business is probably down 50 percent this year, but I’m seeing a little bit of an uptick in home visits. They’re around 60-40 indoors-outdoors. I looked into the Zoom thing, and to be honest with you, there’s a pretty good capital outlay. You have to buy green screens, cameras, and ring lights and backdrops and all that stuff. And I’m more about the personal visit anyway. That’s kind of why I don’t do the malls, because that’s more about the picture.

The weekend after Thanksgiving through Christmas, I’ve got 48 visits booked, and I usually run about 70 a year. I’m going to go try to get tested at least 14 days prior to that. I’ve also invested in a thermometer, so that if people would like to check temperatures, we can do that before we get started. I’m going to be cautious and use common sense. And if something gets out of hand, I will stop whatever we’re doing. But I’m not too worried about it. I’m probably one of the younger Santas around here, and I don’t have any underlying health issues. If I get it, I get it.

The Bad Santa: Rafe Wadleigh, 47, Tacoma, Washington

Gigs were starting to come in, and then Washington recently put a moratorium on gatherings larger than five. It’s definitely a big hit. In a normal year, I personally do about 10 to 12 [bookings] through the holiday season. It’s not a ton, but I can always depend on a good little paycheck in January from it. But also, it’s just super fun.

My Bad Santa is the jolly, drinky uncle that comes to the party — like, you don’t want him to sleep over, but for 30 minutes, people love it. He’s fun, he doesn’t upset anybody, he tells all the ladies they’re pretty and tells some very off-color jokes. I have a lot of clients that come back to me year after year for corporate parties. Some of these groups have been coming back to me for years. I’ve always felt a little bit like a part of the family coming in on a special party night, like, “Remember, last year when you made that North Pole joke, and my wife spit up her drink?”

Usually, depending on the client, I’ll get a little bit of roasting information so I can come prepared to zing people. I’ll probably end up using technology a little bit, maybe some silly virtual backdrops that’ll kind of elevate the comedy, ideally. But nothing beats the live in-person improv in the physical space, right? You can still improv, but as we all know, these Zoom things are a little hard to manage, because people want to talk over each other and laugh, so that dynamic tends to be a challenge to kind of manage the flow of the party in the comedy.

But I think people are so hungry for connection right now. I think if anything, people will, to some degree, suspend their disbelief and be like, this is as good as we can get right now. Let’s really lean into it and enjoy the togetherness even if it’s through a screen.",voxdotcom,"['santas', 'doing', 'im', 'kids', 'virtual', 'think', 'santa', 'visits', 'little', 'ill', 'christmas', 'plexiglass', 'season', 'handling', 'pandemic']",0

2020-12-22 22:40:03+00:00,13,"A new, seemingly more contagious variety of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — that has been spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom has now been found in the United States in at least two locations.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced December 30 that the new strain, known as B.1.1.7 (we’ll call it the UK variant, for simplicity’s sake), was detected in the southern part of the state. It’s the second report of the UK variant in the US in as many days, following news that the variant was found in a male Colorado National Guard member in his 20s with no history of travel, a sign that the virus is spreading locally.

“There is a lot we don’t know about this COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement.

The evidence that this new strain spreads more easily between people is not rock solid, but it’s concerning enough to have forced dramatic action, like shutting down travel from the United Kingdom earlier this month. But it wasn’t enough: The variant has now been detected in Canada, Spain, Sweden, France, and Italy, among others.

At the moment, it doesn’t appear as though the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 is more dangerous in individuals. It doesn’t seem to make people sicker, nor is it more likely to kill them. “I think the key point is that there is no evidence now … that this virus is more pathogenic — creates more problems, more morbidity and mortality — than the previous virus,” Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, said during a December 21 press conference.

What it does appear to do, at least based on preliminary evidence, is spread more quickly among people. That alone is a problem: The coronavirus spreads fast enough as it is. Compounding concerns is that the UK variant echoes a similar story in South Africa, where a strain called 501.V2 has become the dominant version among new cases of the virus. Scientists are wondering whether that strain is more transmissible, too.

The virus has been continually changing its genetics through the course of the pandemic. That’s what RNA-based viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do — they mutate. Most of the time, the mutations mean nothing. But this time, something is different.

“I’ve spent a lot of time this year reminding people that mutations are normal,” molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft, who works on a project called Nextstrain, said. For the entire pandemic, scientists around the world have been collecting genetic information about SARS-CoV-2 in a public database called GISAID. Hodcroft and her colleagues at Nextstrain draw on this database to closely track genetic changes in the virus.

In the past, mutations haven’t warranted big newspaper headlines. “I’m now finding myself singing a slightly different tune,” Hodcroft said. This time, there does seem to be evidence that the new strain is something worth being vigilant about. “We probably should consider taking some precautionary measures while we’re trying to find out more,” she added.

At the same time, Covid-19 is surging around the world, even without these new mutations. Scientists are still trying to figure out what these new variants of the coronavirus actually mean for the pandemic. It’s also unclear where else the UK variant may have already spread, aside from the countries where it has been detected. While it was reported in the US only this week, it could have been in the country for much longer. “The variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported December 22.

The good news is that we already know how to respond to these new variants: in the same way we’ve been responding to the pandemic overall. The virus still transmits primarily through viral-laden breaths in the air. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and good indoor ventilation are as critical as ever.

There’s a lot about this story that’s potentially very alarming or confusing. And the story is not yet complete, as scientists need more evidence to understand whether these new variants pose a new threat.

To add some clarity, here’s what researchers have learned so far. Let’s start with the basics.

Viral mutations, explained

Viral mutations. New strains. Increased transmission. It all sounds like scary science fiction. But to demystify things, and to understand why scientists are a little concerned about this new variant — and why most variants don’t faze them — it’s worth understanding how viruses mutate in the first place.

“Oftentimes, I think the word mutation in general conjures up a lot of things in people’s minds, like, you know, Ninja Turtles or X-Men or cancer, like zombie apocalypse-type stuff,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said. “A mutation is just a lot more mundane than that.”

Viruses mutate because they’re constantly making copies of themselves in enormous numbers. To accomplish this, they have to hijack the hardware of a host cell that they infect. However, this process can be a bit sloppy.

Within a human body, a virus can replicate itself millions or billions of times, Hodcroft explains. If you were writing a draft of something millions of times on a computer, extremely quickly, you’d probably make some typos. That’s what’s happening with the viruses. “They make a typo” in their genetic code, she says. One letter of their ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain is replaced with another.

Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, like SARS-CoV-2, are particularly vulnerable to mutations since the RNA molecule itself is more unstable than DNA. The process of copying RNA is also more prone to error.

These typos can be very useful for scientists because they happen at a regular rate, and are passed down through generations of the virus as it spreads through a community. Often, scientists can use these subtle changes to trace certain strains’ lineage and their spread through a population.

The majority of these typos are inconsequential when it comes to human health. “One typo, or even a few typos, doesn’t usually change how the virus works,” Hodcroft says. Some even harm the virus. “You’re much more likely to break it than to make it better” when it comes to mutations, she says.

But in rare instances, some mutations can give a virus an advantage, like allowing it to infect cells more readily or spread among people faster. Those mutant strains can then become dominant within a population.

That might be what we’re looking at here with the UK variant; this new strain may have accumulated typos that could make it more easily transmitted between people.

Four lines of evidence converging on this new mutation being more transmissible

So why do scientists think this variant is more transmissible?

They don’t have this nailed down yet for sure, but four converging streams of evidence are all pointing in the same direction. “That’s making people feel like maybe there is something here to be worried about,” Hodcroft says. “Each one of these things on their own, I would say is not necessarily convincing.” But all together, they paint a concerning picture.

One is that in the areas of the UK where this new variant is spreading, it is accounting for a larger proportion of new cases. “What this implies is that this new variant is spreading better than other variants that are circulating in the same region,” she says.

National testing data shows increased prevalence of the variant in positive cases over time. This is detected incidentally by the commonly used 3-gene PCR test because 69-70del leads to a negative signal. But this does not effect the results of the test. 7/

A second is that the increase didn’t co-occur with any overly obvious change in human behavior. “We don’t really have strong evidence that everyone in the southeast [UK where this variant is spreading] has just ripped their masks off and is, you know, totally violating restrictions,” she says. That said, it could be a coincidence. It could be just that people who happen to have contracted this variant have it are spreading it more often via their behavior.

After all, “this new variant has emerged at a time of the year when there has traditionally been increased family and social mixing,” according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which estimated that the transmissibility of the new variant has increased by 70 percent compared to prior versions of the virus. Both Rasmussen and Hodcroft say the 70 percent more transmissible figure is most likely an overestimate. A recent, not yet peer-reviewed study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine used a mathematical model to estimate that the new strain may be 56 percent more infectious.

Third, there’s some early data about how this variant acts in Covid-19 patients. “There may be slightly higher viral loads in patients with the variants,” Hodcroft says, suggesting the virus has an easier time replicating in the body. (Viral load refers to the amount of virus in the patient. Rasmussen also cautions that viral load data is really sensitive to timing and when the patient was sampled in the course of the illness, so there needs to be more data to confirm this.)

Finally, the genetic changes in the UK variant mirror changes in the South African variant, which has also been associated with rising case numbers. That makes a plausible link: that this particular genetic change may be behind the increased transmissibility in both variants.

However, this is still short of definitive confirmation that the new variant is more transmissible.

According to Slaoui, figuring this out for certain would require laboratory animal testing to see how easily the virus can spread from one organism to another. But this testing can take several weeks.

In the face of that uncertainty, many urge caution.

Again, there’s still no evidence this new variant causes more severe disease. The evidence points only to increased transmissibility. But a more transmissible virus is still a concern. “In general, the more people get infected, the number of hospitalizations and deaths rise accordingly as a proportion of that number,” Hodcroft says. “So more cases is also bad news.”

What does the mutation ... do?

The UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 actually contains 23 mutations in the genome of the virus. “We don’t really know what they do,” Rasmussen says. Individually, many of these mutations have already been seen in other strains of the virus around the world. But the combination of these changes in a single virus could be making the new variant more likely to spread.

However, scientists do think that some mutations may be more important than others, and there are several mechanisms by which mutations could make the virus more infectious. Those include:

1. The virus could end up with changes to its spike protein that allow it to enter cells more easily.

2. The virus could develop a mechanism to replicate more quickly inside a body, which would lead “to people becoming infectious faster, or contagious faster than they would with another variant,” Rasmussen explains.

3. The virus could theoretically have evolved an ability to counteract the cell’s innate immune defenses, making it easier to infect that cell.

One of the pathways scientists suspect may be at work stems from the N501Y mutation, where the amino acid asparagine is replaced by the amino acid tyrosine in the 501st position of the viral protein sequence. It’s one of several mutations in the virus’s spike protein in the UK variant, but N501Y is in the part of the spike that actually comes into direct contact with human cells. The same mutation has been found in the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 that’s also quickly spreading.

Since the virus attaching to a host cell is critical to the virus’s reproduction, the virus’s spike protein is especially important — and delicate.

“If you were just making random changes in the lab, almost any change you make in that area would result in just a dead virus that can no longer get into the cell,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University Texarkana. “That fact that this thing is able to spread at all tells you that it’s at least as good as the original version. The fact that it’s spreading faster may indicate that it’s a little bit better at grabbing on to host cells, which is the first step of the entry process.”

But this particular N501Y mutation has already been detected in strains that have risen and fallen in other parts of the world over the course of the pandemic. So it may be that the other mutations coupled with N501Y are having some sort of compounding effect. And scientists still need to do more work to determine if this is actually what’s causing the rise of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Finding out the answer could help researchers come up with ways to counter this variety of the coronavirus.

How did these coronavirus mutations happen?

Scientists don’t know exactly how the UK variant came to be. But there may be a clue. Hodcroft is struck by the sheer number of mutations in the UK variant — 23 in all — which makes her suspect it’s possible this variant arose in an immunocompromised person. “It’s an above-average number of mutations,” she says.

In most people, she explains, the immune system mounts a full-on assault on the virus, eliminating it in a matter of a couple of weeks. “In people that have compromised immune systems, though, there’s a very different dynamic,” she says. “So, for one thing, the virus could be in them for months instead of weeks.” That gives the virus more time to evolve, to accumulate mutations that might make it easier to thwart the immune system.

“It’s one scenario,” she says. “We may never know exactly what happened here.”

The basic truth: The more this virus spreads, the more chances there are for dangerous new variants to emerge. In any person — or animal, for that matter — the chance for a dangerous new variant to arise is rare. But rare things can happen when there are so many cases: more than 80 million confirmed cases worldwide.

Since viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are mutating and since Covid-19 has spread in so many people, it’s theoretically only a matter of time before a certain set of mutations align in a way to give the virus a boost.

What can we do about Covid-19 mutants?

To stop mutations, quite simply, we need to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. But “that’s also conveniently how we get fewer emerging variants,” Rasmussen says. “If the virus isn’t replicating, it can’t mutate. And if it can’t mutate, the new variants can’t emerge.”

We fight the new variant as we would any variant of SARS-CoV-2: with masks, with social distancing, with good hand hygiene. “I don’t think people should be panicking,” Hodcroft says. “Lower case numbers, no matter what the variant, are better.”

It’s already been said but if we actually follow protocol and have policies that support those protocols a new variant that is more transmissible would be combatted just as an older variant. So like worry less about mutants and more about masking and distancing and vaccination. — K. Taylor, Ph.D., M.S. (@KYT_ThatsME) December 21, 2020

Scientists have one more tool, though: genetic tracking. At Nextstrain, Hodcroft and her colleagues receive viral genetic sequences from all over the world to try to paint a real-time picture of transmission chains and keep tabs on how the virus is changing. But not every place in the world is providing the same amount of data.

The UK does a lot of viral sequencing, for instance. It was able to pick up on the new viral strain quickly because of that. In other locations around the globe, that might not have happened so fast.

“In the US, it’s a really spotty picture,” Hodcroft says when it comes to sequencing. “Some states have really invested in sequencing; some states haven’t. So for some states, we probably have a fair idea of what’s going on. In other states, we really don’t have many sequences.”

Overall, the CDC reports that the US has sequenced only 51,000 of the more than 17 million cases reported in the country. That’s 0.07 percent. In comparison, the UK aims to sequence 10,000 virus samples per week, and plans to increase that capacity further. (In addition: The UK sequences the genomes faster than the US, according to infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford.) That lack of viral genetic testing creates a big blind spot in the US. The UK variant could have already arrived here undetected “given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced,” the CDC states.

More sequencing, overall, would lead to the faster detection of new strains and faster means to contain them if they were deemed problematic.

Do mutations mean a Covid-19 vaccine won’t work anymore?

With new mutations, there is a concern that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 could arise that would be different enough from previous versions such that prior exposures — whether through a vaccine or an infection — won’t offer protection. So, yes, it’s possible that the coronavirus could someday mutate in a way that would elude a vaccine or previous immunity.

Right now, though, scientists think this UK variant would still fall under the same umbrella of protection as earlier strains. If someone received a Covid-19 vaccine for an older generation of the virus, they would likely have protection against this one.

To explain why, it helps to understand how the immune system deals with viruses. When the human body detects a hostile foreign entity like a virus, it starts to produce antibodies (proteins that attach to the virus or to infected cells). Antibodies can then interfere with how the virus works. They can also flag the virus or virus-infected cells for destruction by other immune cells.

The specific places where the antibodies attach to the virus are called epitopes, and most Covid-19 vaccines target epitopes on the virus’s spike protein (which is what the virus uses to attach to human cells and enter them).

“The good thing with the vaccine is that it induces an immune response against several epitopes that have been mapped around the spike protein,” Slaoui said. “The chances that one set of mutations would alter all those epitopes, I think, are extremely very low. The expectation, scientifically, is that these kinds of variations are unlikely to escape fully the protective response by the vaccine.”

More good news: Scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch have announced (via a tweet) preliminary evidence that antibodies that neutralize the more common strain of the virus also neutralize a strain with the N501Y mutation (the one that impacts the part of the virus that comes into direct contact with human cells, as mentioned above). That suggests that an immune system primed — by a natural infection, at least — to fight the old variant can also fight one with this specific mutation.

Some good news (and incredibly fast work) on one of the mutations scientists are worried about: N501Y.

In these lab experiments serum from recovered #covid19 patients was just as good at neutralizing virus with the mutation as without it. https://t.co/SIxfo2x3qp — Kai Kupferschmidt (@kakape) December 22, 2020

Texas A&M’s Neuman noted that there’s also evidence right now showing how well vaccines can protect against mutated forms of the virus in clinical trials. Many of the vaccines being administered were engineered to counter the earliest generations of SARS-CoV-2 but are still showing themselves to be highly effective against Covid-19 caused by more recent versions of the virus.

“All the tests are being done, all the papers being published, are being done with current strains, which have several mutations relative to [the first iterations of the virus], and it does still seem to be working,” Neuman said.

Covid-19 vaccine developers say they are keeping a close eye on these changes and testing to make sure their vaccines are still effective. “In terms of the new variant, Pfizer and BioNTech are monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequence changes and the companies are working to generate data on how well serum from people immunized with [the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine] may be able to neutralize the new strain,” said a Pfizer spokesperson via email.

And the new Covid-19 vaccines are well equipped to adapt. The two that have received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration — the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine — both use mRNA as their platform. These vaccines deliver the instructions for making the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Those human cells then manufacture the component themselves, allowing the immune system to use it to prepare for an infection. One huge advantage of this approach is that the mRNA sequence can be altered quickly; the first such vaccines for Covid-19 were developed within days after the genetic sequence of the virus was posted online.

Could manufacturers like Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech then retool their vaccines to target the new variants without going through the whole tedious clinical trial process again?

Possibly, according to Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA and a professor of medicine at Georgetown University. He told Vox that vaccines for new variants of the influenza virus are approved every year without large-scale trials. New versions of a Covid-19 vaccine to accommodate mutations similarly might not need another round of study in tens of thousands of people, but may require some testing to figure out dosing and immune response. With such a new virus and brand new vaccines, the regulations for these situations have not yet been laid out.

Should we expect more mutations in the future?

Short answer: yes.

The UK and South African variants are unlikely to be the last to make headlines. Coronavirus is constantly evolving. We should expect it to keep changing slightly.

“There will be new variants that emerge,” Rasmussen says. The thing is, with each new significant strain, scientists will have to do careful work to determine whether it’s more dangerous.

And there are some mutations we can perhaps even expect — if not in the coming weeks, over the next several years.

Recently, virology researchers at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center published a preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) study, looking at how a coronavirus that causes the common cold evolved from the 1980s onward. To accomplish that, they got old blood samples, which included antibodies that cling to this particular virus. They also reconstructed pieces of the cold virus from other eras. Basically, they wanted to see if older blood could still neutralize newer virus. If it couldn’t, that would indicate the virus has evolved over time to evade the immune system.

Here’s what the researchers found: “This other human coronavirus does indeed evolve over the course of multiple years to gradually escape human immunity,” Jesse Bloom, a virologist who co-authored the study, says. “So we think this suggests that there’s the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to do the same thing.” But Bloom stresses that this process takes years. It’s enough time to prepare, to monitor, and to potentially tweak vaccine formulations to keep up with the virus’s evolution.

It’s not like the virus can evolve into an entirely different beast. “It can mutate to maybe escape antibodies,” Rachel Eguia, the study’s lead author, says. But it can’t change so much that it alters its ability to enter cells.

Scientists are also keeping their eyes out for a rapid, major mutation event known as recombination. That’s where an individual is infected with two different strains of the virus at the same time, allowing the virus strains to swap parts. These new viruses could then evade the antibodies that targeted their predecessors. Some researchers think that recombination might be how SARS-CoV-2 originated in the first place.

“This is all hypothetical in this particular virus, but it happens in other viruses all the time,” Neuman said.

Faced with these looming challenges, reducing the transmission of the coronavirus in general is still the best way to protect the fragile progress made in the Covid-19 pandemic so far. Reducing transmissions is also one of the best ways to make sure powerful tools like vaccines remain potent for as long as possible. The fact that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are coming out is not a cause for complacency, and these new variants of SARS-CoV-2 highlight how important it is to remain vigilant.

2020-12-22 17:30:06+00:00,19,"Dr. Anthony Fauci has been vaccinated, receiving his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on live TV Tuesday morning.

“I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine, and I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to get vaccinated,” he said moments before receiving the injection.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, became a household name as a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force. He is regarded as one of the country’s most respected experts on Covid-19, even as he clashed with President Donald Trump on various precautions during the pandemic, including taking the drug hydroxychloroquine, testing, implementing travel bans, restarting the NFL season, and reopening schools, as Vox’s Dylan Scott reported.

It wasn’t a battle that worked out for the president — a November CNBC poll indicated that while 78 percent of Americans approve of the job Fauci is doing, only 41 percent would say the same for Trump.

In recent weeks, Fauci has turned much of his attention to persuading the American public that the vaccine is safe. Some experts estimate that 75 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.

As German Lopez wrote for Vox, polls indicate that up to half of Americans are resistant to receiving a vaccine. While these numbers have improved in recent weeks, there is still a concern that vaccine skepticism could derail public health efforts.

“Simply trying to shame people into getting a vaccine isn’t going to work,” Lopez writes. “The public will need to be persuaded — convinced that, as the clinical trials have demonstrated so far, the vaccines are safe and effective.” He says this requires transparency:

With the Covid-19 vaccines, some people can expect to get ill in the hours after a dose — nothing life-threatening or dangerous, but symptoms like fatigue, headaches, chills, and muscle pain have been reported. It’s important, experts said, for officials and health care workers to communicate the symptoms are normal, temporary, a sign that the vaccine is actually working, and worth the benefits of avoiding a much more dangerous illness.

Vaccine skepticism has led many high-profile individuals to get the vaccine publicly, hoping to assuage concerns. Notably, former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton volunteered in early December to take the vaccine together in public. On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden received the vaccine in Delaware, stating “vaccines don’t save lives, vaccinations do.”

Since lockdowns began in the US in March, there has been a clear partisan divide in taking Covid-19 seriously, a dangerous trend that could lead to fewer Republicans receiving the vaccine and stymying the nation’s goal of achieving herd immunity through widespread vaccination. Prominent Republicans getting inoculated early — like US Sens. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, who have posted publicly about receiving the vaccine — could be key to reducing polarization in vaccine adherence.",voxdotcom,"['live', 'public', 'vaccinated', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'receiving', 'dr', 'experts', 'vaccines', 'weeks', 'dangerous', 'fauci', 'tv']",0
2020-12-22 14:52:55+00:00,25,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-12-22 11:00:58+00:00,9,"Facing a new, and potentially more contagious, variant of the coronavirus, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is implementing lockdown measures in London and throughout southeast England that include a ban on holiday gatherings outside immediate households.

Coming after months of a patchwork response to the pandemic from Johnson’s administration — and a week after assurances that Christmas celebrations with up to three separate households would be permitted — his critics are pointing to this latest response as further evidence of shaky leadership amid a crisis that has led to nearly 2 million Britons infected with Covid-19, and has killed more than 67,000.

Johnson announced the measures on Saturday following an emergency cabinet meeting in which top government officials discussed a new strain of the coronavirus that the prime minister said is 70 percent more transmissible than previous versions. Some experts have cautioned that more study must be done to prove whether the mutation is actually more transmissible.

“When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense,” Johnson said. “We have to act on information as we have it, because this is now spreading very fast.”

The announcement follows a week in which Covid-19 case rates in London almost doubled, and government officials said more than 60 percent of cases in the city are attributable to the new strain, known as VUI-202012/01.

This strain is not believed to be deadlier than previous variants, the nation’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said.

“There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments, although urgent work is underway to confirm this,” Whitty said.

The latest lockdown is the country’s strictest since March, and will go into effect on Sunday. It will be reviewed again on December 30, and is an attempt to stop the spread of the new strain beyond England’s southeastern region and its center, London, Johnson said on Saturday.

The new restrictions dictate that nonessential travel — defined as travel for work, education, or health care — in the region is banned. Nonessential shops and businesses, including gyms, salons, and movie theaters, are ordered closed. The area has been placed in the newly created Tier 4 on England’s tier system of risk, with areas designated Tier 1 considered to be places where Covid-19 is more under control.

For weeks, Johnson has struggled to balance a strong public health response to rapidly growing case numbers with pressure not to further damage the economy. As the Christmas holiday period approached, he pledged to loosen restrictions to allow five days of subdued merriment.

“Have yourself a merry little Christmas, but this year, alas, preferably a very little Christmas,” he said last week.

The British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal published a joint editorial this week, criticizing the government’s response to date, and saying that allowing even small holiday gatherings could lead to a spate of new infections that would overwhelm the National Health Service.

“The government was too slow to introduce restrictions in the spring and again in the autumn. It should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing,” the editorial read.

Now, however, Johnson appears to have taken that advice, up to a point: Areas outside of the Tier 4 zone will be allowed to have gatherings on Christmas — although for one day, rather than the multiple-day gatherings Johnson recently promised.

And overall, he said, the lockdown is part of an effort to slow the spread and flatten the curve, in order to prevent strain on hospitals.

“Without action the evidence suggests infections would soar, hospitals would become overwhelmed and many thousands more would lose their lives,” Johnson said Saturday.

Johnson has been criticized for acting too slowly throughout the pandemic

Other countries, including Italy, Austria, and Germany, have also tightened restrictions in response to the holiday season. In France, bars and restaurants are ordered closed and a curfew is in place; on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron announced that he had tested positive for the virus.

Notably, however, the US — which has one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world — has not tightened restrictions on the national level. And Johnson’s decision received pushback from his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, Saturday afternoon, with Trump writing on Twitter, “The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself!”

We don’t want to have lockdowns. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself! https://t.co/sHBJfG9T8X — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2020

Trump has been staunchly anti-lockdown in the US, ceding decisions on efforts to control the spread to state-level leaders. The US response has been haphazard at best, and about 300,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus this year. Both the UK and the US are in the top 10 of countries for per-capita deaths from Covid-19.

Johnson’s opponent in Parliament, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, also criticized the lockdown, but on the grounds that Johnson’s rapid changes of policy were confusing.

“I think the British public is entitled to more decisive leadership than that,” he said.

As Joanne Silberner has reported for Vox, Covid-19 cases have been steadily increasing across the UK since September. Johnson’s critics, Starmer among them, have accused the prime minister of a series of missteps that led to the country’s current crisis.

Among these missteps, Silberner describes poor handling of distributing PPE and implementing testing and contract tracing programs early on in the pandemic. NHS staffers faced a severe shortage of masks and other equipment in the spring, and hundreds of health care workers died. Testing efforts fell short in the spring, while a contact-tracing app faced challenges in the summer, and again during a second attempted roll-out in September.

Silberner also described an attempt to prioritize in-person dining over the summer, by subsidizing meals in August, a move that public health officials largely condemned.

“In a word, it’s nuts,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, about the dining subsidies. “In the midst of a pandemic, it’s actually directly opposite to what the public health evidence suggests.”

In spite of these missteps, Silberner describes a government that does not seem capable of learning from its own mistakes. This now appears to be playing out in Johnson’s endorsement of inter-household visits during the Christmas holidays.

People were likely to want some semblance of the traditions they were accustomed to. But Johnson’s efforts to preserve tradition have failed due to choices made weeks ago — and now the UK must face extreme measures as the government struggles to deal with significant spikes in caseloads.",voxdotcom,"['public', 'restrictions', 'strict', 'tier', 'response', 'health', 'coronavirus', 'strain', 'johnson', 'imposes', 'johnsons', 'lockdown', 'christmas', 'uk', 'facing']",0
2020-12-22 05:13:02+00:00,24,"Days before the holidays, Congress has passed a $900 billion bill to extend unemployment insurance, pay out additional stimulus checks to Americans and provide more loans for small businesses.

The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed the relief bill Monday night on a vote of 359-53, just hours after the final legislative text was released to members. A few hours later, the Republican-controlled US Senate did the same with a vote of 92-6.

“It is a good bipartisan bill,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor Monday morning, mentioning provisions Democrats secured like additional food assistance and a temporary extension of an eviction moratorium. Pelosi also nodded to the $600 direct payments that will be going out to Americans. “I would have liked them to have been bigger, but they are significant and they will be going out soon,” she said.

The bill is designed to be a short-term bridge to get financial relief to Americans as the country enters a particularly difficult stretch of the coronavirus pandemic, with about 200,000 new confirmed cases per day. At the same time, an end may be in sight, with the first vaccines going out to health care workers and more on the way.

“We can finally report what our nation has needed to hear for a long time: More help is on the way,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday night. Pelosi and McConnell themselves received a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine last week, and President-elect Joe Biden also received his on Monday.

There are still a number of big things that didn’t make it into the final relief bill, including broad aid to state and local governments that Democrats wanted, and liability protections for companies that were a top priority for Republicans. Addressing the Senate Sunday night, Schumer admitted while states and cities would receive some funding specifically for education, Covid-19 testing, and public transit, “the agreement we reached is far from perfect.”

Democratic leaders and President-elect Joe Biden have said they want Congress to pass additional stimulus when Biden takes office.

“Immediately, starting in the new year, Congress will need to get to work on support for our COVID-19 plan, for support to struggling families, and investments in jobs and economic recovery,” Biden said in a statement Sunday. “There will be no time to waste.”

But additional federal stimulus may well hinge on a pair of undecided Senate races in Georgia that will decide which party controls the Senate. Passing another deal may not be easy.

What the stimulus deal contains

While there’s a lot that the stimulus agreement omits, it is expected to offer much-needed aid on a few fronts. Here’s what we know so far on the details.

Stimulus checks: There is a second round of stimulus checks, though they are smaller than those distributed earlier this year. These direct payments include $600 for individuals who made $75,000 a year or less in adjusted gross income in 2019, and $1,200 for couples who made $150,000 or less. Individuals and couples with children who qualify for the stimulus checks would also receive an additional $600 per child. Payments will be incrementally reduced for people who make more in annual income, much like they were in the spring.

Unemployment insurance (UI): The plan includes an additional $300 in weekly federal UI payments through March 14, 2021. This supplemental payment is set to bolster the weekly payment that recipients would get from their state unemployment programs, much like a prior provision did in the CARES Act. The bill would also extend the pandemic unemployment insurance programs that are expiring at the end of December. These pandemic-specific programs currently provide roughly 12 million Americans with UI benefits.

Small-business support: $325 billion is dedicated to small-business aid including repurposed funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, a forgivable loan program that business owners can apply for to cover payroll and operational costs. These loans are aimed at businesses that have seen revenue declines this year. For many, however, this aid comes too late — according to a Fortune report, almost 100,000 small businesses have already closed permanently during the pandemic.

Rental assistance and eviction moratorium: $25 billion in rental assistance is included as well as the establishment of a federal eviction moratorium. As Vox’s Jerusalem Demsas previously reported, tenant advocates have argued that at least $100 billion in rental aid is needed to cover current shortfalls. Additional action would be required to ensure that millions of Americans would not be evicted at the end of January.

Food aid: $13 billion for food aid to help fund a monthly 15 percent increase in individual SNAP benefits, aid for children who received food support at school, and money for other programs including Meals on Wheels and WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children). Demand for such aid has spiked dramatically during the pandemic, with food banks across the country facing overwhelming need in recent months.

Paid sick leave: There are tax credits for businesses that voluntarily provide paid leave, which continues a policy established in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, but companies are not mandated to offer such benefits. Previously, workers who had coronavirus or those caring for children dealing with school closures were guaranteed paid leave if their workplaces were covered by FFCRA.

The legislation contains a number of other provisions: The bill includes $82 billion to help schools reopen; $45 billion for public transit systems; $27 billion to help states ramp up Covid-19 testing; and $15 billion in small business loans specifically targeted to theaters and small venues that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The bill also includes $15 billion in aid for airlines — which would be required to bring furloughed employees back — according to Reuters.

It also includes language to ban surprise medical bills for emergency care, the product of months of bipartisan negotiations to end the practice that contributes to some patients getting steep medical bills from out-of-network providers.

Finally, the bill also has new guidelines for the Federal Reserve after Republicans — led by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) — demanded recent emergency lending programs at the Fed be canceled in any final version of the bill.

As Vox’s Emily Stewart has explained, the Fed will be forced to eliminate several emergency lending programs created with CARES Act funding in the spring, and will be barred from restarting them without congressional approval. It will also return the unused portion of the $454 billion Congress allotted it under the CARES Act to the Treasury Department, something the Fed had agreed to do in November.

The bill doesn’t provide direct aid for state and local governments, a Democratic priority, or the liability protections that shield businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits Republicans had advocated for. Additional deferment of federal student loan payments is also not included in the agreement, Politico’s Michael Stratford reports.

How long it will take people to receive help

Speaking on CNBC Monday morning, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin laid out an optimistic timeline for when Americans will see relief in the form of stimulus checks.

“The good news is this is a very, very fast way of getting money into the economy,” Mnuchin said. “Let me emphasize: People are going to see this money at the beginning of next week.”

But based on the timing of aid from the CARES Act, it could be a few weeks before people see direct relief from the legislation.

Earlier this year, the first round of direct payments was deposited in people’s bank accounts around mid-April: “Within two weeks of the CARES Act going into effect in March, more than 81 million payments were disbursed, totaling more than $147 billion, all through electronic transfers to recipients’ bank accounts, according to the Government Accountability Office,” CNBC recently reported.

People who do not have bank accounts, or whose information is not on file with the IRS, will likely see a more delayed distribution of the payments. For more information on what to expect with stimulus payments in the coming weeks, you can read Vox’s explainer here.

The timing of the implementation of enhanced unemployment insurance payments will also depend on the state. States began distributing $600 in supplemental UI roughly two weeks after the CARES Act was approved this past spring, which means the weekly $300 addition could begin in early January.

And when it comes to the Paycheck Protection Program, banks and other financial institutions began taking applications about a week after the funds were approved by Congress in March. That could set up applications for a new round of loans to kick off at the end of December or early January.

This lag time could be costly for those waiting on assistance; by the time much of this money gets to those who need it, the programs they are meant to extend will have been expired for weeks.

Nevertheless, such aid comes at a crucial time: According to the latest Labor Department report, 19 million people are currently receiving unemployment insurance. In November, job growth slowed significantly compared to the prior month, suggesting that the unemployed are facing limited opportunities for new work. And this winter, coronavirus cases are projected to soar — forcing thousands of businesses to shutter or slow their operations to prevent the spread of the illness.",voxdotcom,"['package', '900', 'bill', 'additional', 'americans', 'programs', 'covid19', 'aid', 'relief', 'payments', 'cares', 'act', 'stimulus', 'congress', 'passed', 'officially', 'billion']",0

2020-12-22 02:52:58+00:00,10,"President-elect Joe Biden received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Delaware on Monday on live TV. After rolling up his sleeve and getting the shot, Biden thanked health care workers and scientists.

“We owe these folks an awful lot,” he said. “The scientists and the people who put this together, the front-line workers, the people who were the ones that did the clinical work.”

Biden made it clear that his decision to get vaccinated on television is part of the urgent effort to show Americans that the vaccine is safe and effective. “It’s worth saying that this is a great hope. I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared, when it’s available, to take the vaccine,” he said.

Last week, when Biden announced his decision to get vaccinated publicly, he said getting the vaccine is “about more than politics.”

“This is about saving lives,” he said. “I look forward to receiving the vaccine publicly on Monday and continuing to build confidence in the scientific process. Vaccines don’t save lives, vaccinations do.”

Nurse practitioner Tabe Mase administered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to Biden at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. Soon-to-be first lady Jill Biden did not take her vaccine publicly as previously announced; Joe Biden told reporters that she received the shot earlier in the day. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will be vaccinated next week, according to Biden’s transition team.

Biden joins a growing list of lawmakers who have lined up for the shot as provided under the country’s continuity of government framework. Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence, and US Surgeon General Jerome Adams all received the vaccine on live television on Friday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rolled up their sleeves for the vaccine too, with Pelosi touting her confidence in science and McConnell claiming that more Americans need the vaccine “as fast as possible.” Other lawmakers, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), took to social media to broadcast the process.

Biden’s decision to get vaccinated before the public may help reluctant Americans who still say they want to wait it out, or not take the vaccine at all. An ABC/Ipsos poll released on December 14 found that more than 80 percent of Americans are willing to take the vaccine, but just 40 percent say they would take it as soon as it’s available to them.

Despite the growing effort to convince Americans that the vaccine is safe, President Donald Trump has not announced plans to be vaccinated. Republicans are also less likely to say they will get the vaccine. The administration has sent a mixed message about the vaccine as Trump has focused his efforts on attempting to overturn the election results.

The coronavirus has killed more than 310,000 Americans; experts estimate that 60 percent to 85 percent of Americans must be vaccinated for the country to achieve true herd immunity.

Vaccine hesitancy remains high among certain groups

Biden’s public vaccination may be effective at swaying some Americans, but it may be harder to convince others — the latest data on vaccine hesitancy shows that specific groups, like Republicans, rural Americans, and Black people, are more wary of the Covid-19 vaccine.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s December Covid-19 monitor of public opinion, vaccine hesitancy can be reduced with more information since many Americans, across specific groups, still believe misinformation about the vaccines.

The survey found that about a quarter (27 percent) of the public is still vaccine-hesitant, claiming that they probably or definitely won’t get a Covid-19 vaccine. But the number is higher among Republicans (42 percent), those ages 30 to 49 (36 percent), rural residents (35 percent), and Black adults (35 percent).

Those who reported feeling hesitant about the vaccine claimed to be worried about potential side effects and cited lack of trust in government to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness. Respondents also claimed that the vaccine was too new and that politics and partisanship played a negative role in the vaccine’s development. For Black adults, many reported not trusting vaccines in general, and said they worried they might get Covid-19 from the vaccine itself.

The survey found that the share of people who said they would get the vaccine has increased by 8 percent since September. Black Americans’ willingness to get the vaccine increased from 50 percent in September to 62 percent in December. Willingness increased for Republicans during those months too, from 47 percent to 56 percent. This rise gives researchers hope that more information about the vaccine can change minds. The survey also reported that as more trusted sources reveal they have been vaccinated, more people will sign up to be vaccinated.

Biden plans to have 100 million vaccine shots administered in the first 100 days of his administration. “The fight against Covid-19 is not yet over,” he said in a statement. “We know the immense challenges ahead, including scaling up manufacturing, distribution, and the monumental task of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans.”",voxdotcom,"['live', 'joe', 'vaccinated', 'public', 'biden', 'black', 'americans', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'workers', 'republicans', 'shot', 'tv']",0

Food aid: $13 billion for food aid to help fund a monthly 15 percent increase in individual SNAP benefits, aid for children who received food support at school, and money for other programs including Meals on Wheels and WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children). Demand for such aid has spiked dramatically during the pandemic, with food banks across the country facing overwhelming need in recent months.

The bill also includes $15 billion in aid for airlines — which would be required to bring furloughed employees back — according to Reuters.

It also includes language to ban surprise medical bills for emergency care, the product of months of bipartisan negotiations to end the practice that contributes to some patients getting steep medical bills from out-of-network providers.

Finally, the bill also has new guidelines for the Federal Reserve after Republicans — led by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) — demanded recent emergency lending programs at the Fed be canceled in any final version of the bill.

As Vox’s Emily Stewart has explained, the Fed will be forced to eliminate several emergency lending programs created with CARES Act funding in the spring, and will be barred from restarting them without congressional approval. It will also return the unused portion of the $454 billion Congress allotted it under the CARES Act to the Treasury Department, something the Fed had agreed to do in November.

The bill doesn’t provide direct aid for state and local governments, a Democratic priority, or the liability protections that shield businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits Republicans had advocated for. Additional deferment of federal student loan payments is also not included in the agreement, Politico’s Michael Stratford reports.

How long it will take people to receive help

Speaking on CNBC Monday morning, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin laid out an optimistic timeline for when Americans will see relief in the form of stimulus checks.

“The good news is this is a very, very fast way of getting money into the economy,” Mnuchin said. “Let me emphasize: People are going to see this money at the beginning of next week.”

But based on the timing of aid from the CARES Act, it could be a few weeks before people see direct relief from the legislation.

Earlier this year, the first round of direct payments was deposited in people’s bank accounts around mid-April: “Within two weeks of the CARES Act going into effect in March, more than 81 million payments were disbursed, totaling more than $147 billion, all through electronic transfers to recipients’ bank accounts, according to the Government Accountability Office,” CNBC recently reported.

People who do not have bank accounts, or whose information is not on file with the IRS, will likely see a more delayed distribution of the payments. For more information on what to expect with stimulus payments in the coming weeks, you can read Vox’s explainer here.

The timing of the implementation of enhanced unemployment insurance payments will also depend on the state. States began distributing $600 in supplemental UI roughly two weeks after the CARES Act was approved this past spring, which means the weekly $300 addition could begin in early January.

And when it comes to the Paycheck Protection Program, banks and other financial institutions began taking applications about a week after the funds were approved by Congress in March. That could set up applications for a new round of loans to kick off at the end of December or early January.

This lag time could be costly for those waiting on assistance; by the time much of this money gets to those who need it, the programs they are meant to extend will have been expired for weeks.

Nevertheless, such aid comes at a crucial time: According to the latest Labor Department report, 19 million people are currently receiving unemployment insurance. In November, job growth slowed significantly compared to the prior month, suggesting that the unemployed are facing limited opportunities for new work. And this winter, coronavirus cases are projected to soar — forcing thousands of businesses to shutter or slow their operations to prevent the spread of the illness.",voxdotcom,"['package', '900', 'bill', 'additional', 'americans', 'programs', 'covid19', 'aid', 'relief', 'payments', 'cares', 'act', 'stimulus', 'congress', 'passed', 'officially', 'billion']",0
2020-12-22 01:52:44+00:00,15,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

Don’t go to that beach or park. Don’t go to that bar or restaurant. Don’t do anything for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Wear a mask! You don’t want to kill Grandma, do you?

Public officials have joined in. Increasingly, they are blaming private gatherings, not the restaurants and bars they insist on keeping open, for the spread of the disease. In some places, such as the Dakotas, framing Covid-19 prevention as an individual responsibility became the core of the strategy to fight Covid-19. As cases and deaths climbed to among the highest rates in the world, South Dakota’s leaders preached “personal responsibility” and refused to require masks, much less stricter measures. Ian Fury, a spokesperson for Gov. Kristi Noem (R), told me his boss gave citizens “up-to-date science, facts, and data, and then trusted them to make the best decisions for themselves and their loved ones.”

It’s true that individuals have an important role in fighting Covid-19. Everyone should wear a mask, and, unfortunately, everyone should reconsider big family gatherings this holiday season. But relying on individual action to fight a deadly virus — an approach that the US has leveraged for problems ranging from the opioid crisis to global warming — simply hasn’t worked.

Today, America is among the worst performers at fighting Covid-19. Despite recent surges in Europe and Israel, the US remains within the top 20 percent for most coronavirus deaths per person among developed nations, with more than twice the death rate as the median developed country. If the US managed the same Covid-19 death rate as Canada, more than 190,000 Americans would likely be alive today.

There are many reasons for that, not least President Donald Trump’s awful leadership. But part of it, experts say, is America’s inability to address structural problems, instead relying on demanding more from individuals. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, highlighted this problem when he remarked that the “independent spirit in the United States of people not wanting to comply with public health measures has certainly hurt us a bit.”

That was clear in much of the public’s response to lockdowns starting in the spring. With “Don’t Tread on Me” flags hoisted in the background, protesters often took to statehouses to demand the end of government-mandated closures. At the demonstrations, attendees claimed they could take care of themselves and didn’t need the government to tell them what to do.

It’s also been apparent in the government responses. The emphasis on individualism helps explain why Trump and his conservative allies, like Noem, have resisted more government mandates on masks and stay-at-home orders in lieu of letting people deal with the virus for themselves.

But it’s not just Trump and friends. Every state in the country, Democratic or Republican, has at some point reopened restaurants or bars, allowing people to congregate in indoor areas that experts widely agree are breeding grounds for Covid-19. While resisting shutting down such places, local and state officials have argued that it’s on people to wear masks, cancel private gatherings for the holidays, and avoid nonessential activities — while leaving room for people to not follow at least some of those guidelines. Every state in the country has also, subsequently, seen surges in the coronavirus this fall.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo exemplified the failure of this approach. In the lead-up to Thanksgiving, he said, “My personal advice is you don’t have family gatherings — even for Thanksgiving.” Days later, it came out that Cuomo was planning to host a family gathering with his 89-year-old mother and two of his three adult daughters. He only canceled after a public backlash. Even Cuomo wasn’t planning on following his own advice. (Cuomo’s office argued his comments were misinterpreted.)

Meanwhile, much less attention has gone to addressing Covid-19 from a truly structural perspective. The coronavirus has revealed America’s pathetic public health infrastructure — there’s still no national testing-and-tracing program, and no state has an adequate contact tracing program, if they have such a program at all. Businesses and workers have been left to fend for themselves, as Congress failed to pass an economic relief bill before the last one started to expire. For all the talk about outdoor activities being safer during the coronavirus pandemic, there’s been next to no action in most of the country on getting people outside — at times, governments have even eliminated outdoor venues by closing parks or beaches.

“It’s a structural issue,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “Systemic challenges in the United States — that predate the pandemic but have gotten worse [during the pandemic] — lead to the situation we’re in.”

It’s easy to yell at people over their Covid-19 failures — simply log on to Twitter and blast away. It’s costless for a governor to tell people that it’s on them to stop the spread of the coronavirus by voluntarily giving up things they love, especially if the same governor doesn’t even plan on following his own advice.

So rather than do anything about it, Americans are stuck blaming each other for Covid-19. But until we truly realize this is a collective failure, not an individual one, the problems will linger.

Structural problems are really to blame here

Since the start of America’s epidemic, experts have warned that indoor dining and bars are among the worst places for the spread of Covid-19: People are in poorly ventilated indoor areas where the virus spreads more easily sit close for possibly hours, can’t wear masks as they eat or drink, and spew germs at each other as they shout, sing, and laugh.

So many experts have called on governments to close bars and restaurants. Acknowledging the economic toll of this, economists and public health experts have also asked for a bailout of the industry to make employers and their workers whole until the pandemic resides.

None of that happened. Instead, America started to reopen before Covid-19 cases were under control — at the US’s best point in the spring and summer, it still had more than 60 times the daily new cases of Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea — with bars and restaurants reopening in every state by the fall. Public officials acknowledged the risks but merely moved to limit capacity and called on everyone to be responsible by physical distancing, wearing a mask, and limiting contact with people from other households.

This has not gone well. Coronavirus cases have shot up across much of the country, with the US in the middle of its third and biggest surge of Covid-19 yet. At the same time, we’ve gotten more data showing how dangerous bars and restaurants can be for the spread of Covid-19: A study published in the Journal of Korean Medical Science found that a person in South Korea may have been infected with Covid-19 in a restaurant in as little as five minutes. Another study in Nature found, “Reopening full-service restaurants was associated with a particularly high risk.”

Despite that, officials across the country have by and large resisted shutting down again. Many of them, instead, have cited another culprit for Covid-19 spread: private gatherings. New York, for example, put out a PSA to stop “living room spread,” and the state published data suggesting households and private gatherings are driving 74 percent of coronavirus spread.

It’s true private gatherings and households are driving some transmission. Most experts agree Thanksgiving dinners likely led to a surge on top of a surge, and similar Christmas and New Year’s events likely will too.

But that’s why at least some experts believe there’s a need for more focus on systemic action, not the individualistic approach. “People, in general, are horrendous risk assessors — we’re awful at assessing risk,” Daniel Goldberg, a medical historian and public health ethicist at the University of Colorado, told me. “I hate to say people can’t be trusted, but.”

There are other problems with this framing. For one, the New York data doesn’t separate within-household transmissions from social gatherings — so the 74 percent figure includes someone spreading Covid-19 to the husband he lives with (not as avoidable) and someone spreading the virus to someone he invited over for drinks one night (very avoidable). This also only includes the cases that New York could actually contact trace, and it’s much easier to trace transmission between family and friends in a household than strangers in a bar.

The big problem, though, is that there’s nothing unusual about Covid-19 spreading among people who live together. It’s typical for the bulk, even the majority, of the transmission of any disease to happen within households. If you’re infected, the people you live with or come into close contact with at home are simply likely to get it too. That’s how pathogens work. What matters most, though, is where that virus originated from in the first place.

To put it another way: People couldn’t infect others in their homes if they hadn’t picked up the coronavirus in bars, restaurants, or other public spaces. So if these places weren’t open, individual choices to gather — including over Thanksgiving and Christmas — would be of far less concern. There would simply be much less virus out there jumping from person to person.

So it largely comes down to the lack of systemic action, not solely the individual choice.

It’s not just bars and restaurants. If officials want people to wear masks, they can mandate masks and actually enforce those mandates. If they want more adults to stay home, they can replace any income individuals might lose by not going into work, or take steps to make work-from-home life more bearable, like deeming schools “essential” or subsidizing day care. If they want people to stay outdoors and not indoors, they can do things that can encourage people to go outside instead of congregating inside — like offering free outdoor activities like ice skating or art installations, or even just places to eat (with some heating during the winter) — rather than shutting down parks. If they want to address racial disparities for Covid-19, they need to address systemic racial disparities across society and health care.

Otherwise, we’re going to be stuck with relying on people to make decisions — almost always against their own social, cultural, and economic interests — to do the right thing. So far, that just isn’t working.

It’s easier to blame individuals than fix big problems

Public leaders and government officials face their own structural forces too.

Brown University School of Public Health dean Ashish Jha told me of a recent conversation with a governor. Jha argued that risky indoor spaces like bars and restaurants should be closed, or hospitals will soon overflow. The governor responded that such closures would require money to support affected businesses and their employees, and the state simply doesn’t have that money. The governor added, “Maybe I should spend a little bit of money and try to campaign for people to be more careful” — a pivot to an individualistic approach.

“I came to appreciate that, ultimately, the problem wasn’t this governor,” Jha said. He later added, “The right answer is not we need better governors — the right answer is we need a different structure and a better federal government.”

Structural issues are, almost by definition, much harder to fix than simply asking people to do the right thing. It’s easy and cheap to yell at people for getting together for Christmas — especially when they really shouldn’t be doing it. Closing down bars and supporting them economically, in turn, requires both political and financial capital.

In some cases, governments legitimately can’t do what they would prefer. Local and state officials, unlike the federal government, can’t print money and usually have to balance their budgets. Given that reality, a governor might decide that she has to keep bars open simply because she can’t bail them out — the economic cost is so high, and, who knows, maybe the state might get lucky and avoid an outbreak anyway. States, counties, and cities face a structural barrier in the federal government’s inaction.

There’s a cultural component, too. Americans pride themselves on their individualistic and libertarian qualities — what Fauci described as an “independent spirit in the United States.” That creates an innate resistance, among the public and its leaders, to look at problems in a collective over an individual manner. So with Covid-19, we yell at people for not distancing or wearing masks in bars, but not as much at public officials for allowing that bar to open in the first place.

The truth, as Covid-19 has shown us, is this individualistic approach doesn’t work well for public health (even if it does serve us well in other areas). The alternative to not taking collective action is more death. The countries that have done the best against Covid-19 — including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and, to a now lesser degree, Germany — all approached the issue collectively, leveraging government aid and public health systems to let people stay home without losing as much income or health insurance, to test and trace infections, and, when necessary, to close down to stop the spread.

In fact, America’s best — and perhaps only — success against Covid-19 so far came about with the power of collective action. The vaccines that are now being shot into the arms of health care workers and people in nursing homes came about with the strong support of various governments, which funded research or, at the very least, paid for tens of millions of doses before the vaccines were even proven to work. Crucially, this came about by acknowledging the structural risks involved in developing a vaccine, particularly that drug companies might be reluctant to gamble on the medications if they may not pan out, and mitigated those risks.

The problem runs deeper than what America did and can do about Covid-19 alone. One advantage that other countries had as the pandemic began is stronger social safety nets, which guaranteed people would retain some income and health care even if a lockdown was needed. The US has no such guarantees — the programs that do exist are notoriously underfunded (hence Congress needing to boost unemployment insurance in its economic relief bills), and far from universal. So while British and German workers could rely on some significant government support even if they lost their jobs, Americans could claim no such certainty.

We see that today. Even as Congress nears a deal on economic relief, the truth is it’s already too late for many Americans. With much of the previous stimulus measure expiring, people who lost their jobs have languished for months with little to no support. And even if the new deal passes Congress (which is still uncertain), there will likely be a lag in actually rolling out those benefits to the people who need them, leading to more prolonged suffering. It could have been avoided if these kinds of benefits were permanent, or kicked in automatically if the economy begins to weaken, as government programs in other developed countries do.

That’s just one example. From building up the social safety net to actually funding public health infrastructure to reforming government so it’s more responsive, there’s a lot of work America could do to make sure it’s better equipped to handle crises as they come up. That won’t completely end the need for leadership in troubled times — European countries with large social safety nets have still passed additional economic relief measures — but it would put the US in a much better place.

It won’t be easy. It means committing to a more hands-on governing structure, costing us more in dollars and cents and forcing many Americans to rethink how they view the role of government.

But if Covid-19 has taught us anything, those changes are worth the cost. It begins with taking a structural, rather than individualistic, view of the problems facing the US today.",voxdotcom,"['public', 'officials', 'solely', 'individuals', 'covid19', 'health', 'cant', 'state', 'coronavirus', 'structural', 'america', 'restaurants', 'bars', 'stop', 'gatherings', 'rely']",0
2020-12-21 18:13:57+00:00,7,"President-elect Joe Biden received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Delaware on Monday on live TV. After rolling up his sleeve and getting the shot, Biden thanked health care workers and scientists.

“We owe these folks an awful lot,” he said. “The scientists and the people who put this together, the front-line workers, the people who were the ones that did the clinical work.”

Biden made it clear that his decision to get vaccinated on television is part of the urgent effort to show Americans that the vaccine is safe and effective. “It’s worth saying that this is a great hope. I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared, when it’s available, to take the vaccine,” he said.

Last week, when Biden announced his decision to get vaccinated publicly, he said getting the vaccine is “about more than politics.”

“This is about saving lives,” he said. “I look forward to receiving the vaccine publicly on Monday and continuing to build confidence in the scientific process. Vaccines don’t save lives, vaccinations do.”

Nurse practitioner Tabe Mase administered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to Biden at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. Soon-to-be first lady Jill Biden did not take her vaccine publicly as previously announced; Joe Biden told reporters that she received the shot earlier in the day. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will be vaccinated next week, according to Biden’s transition team.

Biden joins a growing list of lawmakers who have lined up for the shot as provided under the country’s continuity of government framework. Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence, and US Surgeon General Jerome Adams all received the vaccine on live television on Friday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rolled up their sleeves for the vaccine too, with Pelosi touting her confidence in science and McConnell claiming that more Americans need the vaccine “as fast as possible.” Other lawmakers, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), took to social media to broadcast the process.

Biden’s decision to get vaccinated before the public may help reluctant Americans who still say they want to wait it out, or not take the vaccine at all. An ABC/Ipsos poll released on December 14 found that more than 80 percent of Americans are willing to take the vaccine, but just 40 percent say they would take it as soon as it’s available to them.

Despite the growing effort to convince Americans that the vaccine is safe, President Donald Trump has not announced plans to be vaccinated. Republicans are also less likely to say they will get the vaccine. The administration has sent a mixed message about the vaccine as Trump has focused his efforts on attempting to overturn the election results.

The coronavirus has killed more than 310,000 Americans; experts estimate that 60 percent to 85 percent of Americans must be vaccinated for the country to achieve true herd immunity.

Vaccine hesitancy remains high among certain groups

Biden’s public vaccination may be effective at swaying some Americans, but it may be harder to convince others — the latest data on vaccine hesitancy shows that specific groups, like Republicans, rural Americans, and Black people, are more wary of the Covid-19 vaccine.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s December Covid-19 monitor of public opinion, vaccine hesitancy can be reduced with more information since many Americans, across specific groups, still believe misinformation about the vaccines.

The survey found that about a quarter (27 percent) of the public is still vaccine-hesitant, claiming that they probably or definitely won’t get a Covid-19 vaccine. But the number is higher among Republicans (42 percent), those ages 30 to 49 (36 percent), rural residents (35 percent), and Black adults (35 percent).

Those who reported feeling hesitant about the vaccine claimed to be worried about potential side effects and cited lack of trust in government to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness. Respondents also claimed that the vaccine was too new and that politics and partisanship played a negative role in the vaccine’s development. For Black adults, many reported not trusting vaccines in general, and said they worried they might get Covid-19 from the vaccine itself.

The survey found that the share of people who said they would get the vaccine has increased by 8 percent since September. Black Americans’ willingness to get the vaccine increased from 50 percent in September to 62 percent in December. Willingness increased for Republicans during those months too, from 47 percent to 56 percent. This rise gives researchers hope that more information about the vaccine can change minds. The survey also reported that as more trusted sources reveal they have been vaccinated, more people will sign up to be vaccinated.

Biden plans to have 100 million vaccine shots administered in the first 100 days of his administration. “The fight against Covid-19 is not yet over,” he said in a statement. “We know the immense challenges ahead, including scaling up manufacturing, distribution, and the monumental task of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans.”",voxdotcom,"['live', 'joe', 'vaccinated', 'public', 'biden', 'black', 'americans', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'workers', 'republicans', 'shot', 'tv']",0
2020-12-21 18:00:12+00:00,7,"Uber has spent years and millions of dollars making sure its workers aren’t classified as such and insisting it’s not responsible for those people’s health care. Now the company is pushing for its “earners” — the word it uses to refer to its drivers and delivery people so as not to call them workers — to get priority access to the Covid-19 vaccine.

It’s hardly alone in lobbying public health officials and states to put its people near the top of the list.

Companies and industry groups from across the economy are undertaking efforts at the federal and state level to make the case that when it comes to the limited-supply Covid-19 vaccine, their employees should get priority. The meat industry, airlines, banks, retail, exterminators, restaurants, and zoos are among the myriad groups lobbying decision-makers. So are specific companies such as Amazon, Lyft, DoorDash, and Perdue. Unions are trying to get their members vaccines. Even professional sports leagues, like the NHL, are making a play.

In early December, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommended that health care personnel and long-term care residents should be first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. That “phase 1a” cohort represents about 17.6 million people, or 7 percent of the US adult population, and seems straightforward enough.

What comes next is more complicated. There’s been a mad dash among a variety of stakeholders to try to secure the next spots and a lively debate about who should be prioritized. On Sunday, ACIP issued its recommendation for 1b — the next phase — to be front-line essential workers and people over the age of 75. For 1c, it suggested people 65 or older, people with high-risk conditions, and essential workers not included in 1b.

Ultimately, it is up to states to decide what to do with federal recommendations and decipher which people, including workers, go where. States could deviate from those guidelines — theoretically, a place like California could say entertainers should be higher up on the list, or in New York, bankers. Companies may have an easier time influencing decisions at the state and local level. But in general, states take the guidelines seriously and could face enormous backlash if they ignore them.

“I don’t blame businesses for trying to make their case,” Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told Recode. “But the people that are listening to their rationale ought to use criteria that are going to save the most lives and return our economy.”

Prioritization is just the first chapter in what will likely be months of discussions around how employers approach the Covid-19 vaccine. Which workers within an organization will get the vaccine is going to be an important factor. If a meatpacking company gets access to a vaccine supply, who’s going to ensure it’s the workers on the floor getting a dose and not the CEO? It’s a scenario already playing out in hospitals. And what does it look like for companies to be taking such an activist role in their workers’ health in trying to compel them to get the vaccine? It’s one thing for your boss to recommend you take a vaccine; it’s another for them to require it.

“Pretty much everybody is on the same page with vulnerable people and front-line workers” going first on the vaccine, said Matt McCambridge, founder and CEO of Eden Health, a personal health platform. “There’s a lot of gray area in terms of what happens next.”

The politics of Covid-19 is now the politics of the vaccine

The United States got a preview of vaccine lobbying efforts in the spring, when various interest groups and industry associations fought to get their business activities and workforces deemed “essential” so that they could stay up and running. (It was a designation not all workers desired or appreciated.) You might remember that in April, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis inexplicably declared the WWE essential in the Sunshine State.

So now that there are two emergency-approved vaccines in America, it makes sense that the rich and powerful are going to be jockeying for it. Also pushing for priority are companies that know getting their workers vaccinated would be a big deal for getting their operations back to full capacity. Jonathan Slotkin, chief medical officer for Contigo Health, described the situation as a “wrestling match” where “many interests want to make it clear that the people they represent have a lot of essential workers” in an interview with the Washington Post.

The federal government estimates that there are about 87 million essential workers in the US, half of whom are over the age of 40. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in many industries deemed essential, and about a quarter of essential workers live in low-income families.

On Sunday, ACIP recommended that along with those over the age of 75, some 30 million front-line essential workers should be part of phase 1b of vaccinations. The group includes teachers, first responders, corrections workers, postal workers, public transit workers, grocery store workers, and people who work in food, agriculture, and manufacturing. A second group of some 57 million other essential workers — including those in finance, telecommunications, and construction — will be part of group 1c.

“We need science to drive policy and public health to drive politics”

Again, these are just federal guidelines. States will be the ones to decide who gets priority. So in a pandemic that’s been politicized from the get-go, the politics of vaccine distribution gets dicey quickly.

“Where we’ve gone wrong with our Covid response is that we’ve had politics impact policy, practice, and then science,” said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins. “We need science to drive policy and public health to drive politics.”

Salmon cited an article written by former CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan and epidemiologist Melissa McPheeters in 2004 warning of the dangers of politics having too much influence over public health and science. “If that’s what this looks like, it’s going to be a disaster, it’s going to be really inequitable, and it’s going to be who has more influence over politics,” he said. “This needs to come from science — we need to say who’s most at risk, what jobs are really essential, and that’s how the priority should be done.”

Not every group can lobby for themselves, or have someone do it on their behalf. Homeless people, incarcerated people, and those living in group settings are among those at high risk of contracting Covid-19. If there’s too much politicization and corporate power in the process, those are the types of people who are going to be left out.

Who should get priority is a hard question

A litany of industries, companies, and unions are claiming the workers they represent should get an early spot in the line for vaccines. And many of them have a solid case.

The meatpacking industry, which has seen waves of Covid-19 cases and deaths throughout the pandemic, lobbied the CDC for front-line meat and poultry workers to get early access and has gained support from Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly in its endeavors. The American Bankers Association has advocated for its tellers and other employees, who are in direct contact with the public, to be prioritized. Groups representing air conditioning contractors, transit workers, and pest control workers submitted comments to the CDC arguing for their workers to get priority.

Figuring out what’s right to do here is not particularly easy.

Take, for example, Amazon. It submitted a letter to the CDC asking that workers at its warehouses, data centers, and grocery stores get vaccinated “at the earliest possible time,” noting that it employs 800,000 people, making it the second-largest employer in the US, behind Walmart. Amazon workers have struggled during the pandemic, with tens of thousands sickened by the disease. Who’s to say these workers haven’t more than earned a place in line? The same goes for companies like Walmart, Delta Airlines, Uber, Lyft, Cargill, and the list goes on and on.

Many companies and industries can make a solid case that they’re vital to keeping the economy running and the country going — the same case they made to be deemed essential — and that constitutes a place in line.

In an interview with Recode, Bryan Zumwalt, executive vice president of public affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, which represents companies such as Clorox, Coca-Cola, and General Mills, emphasized the importance of his members’ role in supplying products people rely on every day during the pandemic. “We just want to make sure that our people are in that early 1b group … and that the states are being as clear as possible what the process is going to be,” he said.

After ACIP’s recommendations were released, the group released a statement urging states to follow that guidance and get its 1.7 million essential workers the vaccine soon, arguing that they “must be vaccinated to ensure shelves are stocked and Americans can continue to stay home and stay safe” for the duration of the pandemic.

Some employers and groups are offering to help health officials and governments with the distribution of the vaccine. Perdue, which has sent letters to the governors of 15 states and the CDC asking to be part of 1b, has offered to assist with community outreach, including a multilingual campaign. Uber is offering 10 million free rides to vaccination locations.

To be sure, it’s important to be clear about the motives here. While a lot of these industries and companies do want to protect their workers, they are also well aware that doing so will come with a financial benefit. That’s a big driver.

As the Intercept pointed out, the North American Meat Institute, which is now lobbying for a vaccine for its workers, also drafted an executive order signed by President Donald Trump ordering meatpacking plants to stay open in the spring, even as their workers were getting sick and dying. Uber and Lyft just spent tens of millions of dollars in California to make sure they don’t have to give their drivers typical employee benefits. Amazon cut hazard pay for workers over the summer, though it did recently announce a one-time holiday bonus.

DoorDash is petitioning the CDC and all 50 state governors to prioritize delivery workers for the vaccine, noting that those people have worked throughout the pandemic and “connect goods and services throughout our local communities and serve an essential role with restaurants and other small businesses.” While its business has been booming this year, conditions for its delivery workers — the workers it’s now using to try to exert political pressure — have worsened.

“You can’t blame Uber from a financial self-interest perspective,” Salmon said. “But they should consider that for every dose their driver gets, there’s somebody who’s not going to get one. And who is going to give up that dose?”

Companies that are now taking an interest in their workers’ health and well being could be doing so all the time, not just when it’s financially expedient. And a vaccine does not eliminate the need for other workplace protections. Businesses shouldn’t let their guard down on the ways to prevent the virus from spreading, especially until broad swaths of the population are vaccinated.

“For every dose their driver gets, there’s somebody who’s not going to get one. And who is going to give up that dose?”

There is also a looming issue of who will get the vaccine in organizations once they get a certain amount of doses. There was uproar at Stanford Medicine when hospital administrators and physicians who weren’t in contact with patients were given vaccine doses over those in direct contact with patients because of an algorithm the hospital was using to determine distribution. It’s very easy to imagine a case where a company gets a vaccine and hands it to the C-suite instead of people on the factory floor.

The NHL came under fire recently over a report that it was planning the private purchase of a vaccine for its upcoming season.

To a certain extent, it makes sense — professional sports is a high-dollar industry, and players are being asked to put their lives at risk amid a pandemic to keep people entertained. When Recode contacted the league for comment, an NHL spokesperson pointed to a clarification that it would only look at that possibility “in the context of the availability of excess capacity” and not compete with health care workers, vulnerable populations, and symptomatic individuals for doses. When Recode in a follow-up asked who the vaccines would be for — players? coaches? concession workers? — the NHL did not respond.

Private vaccine sales are possible, though inventory may be hard to come by because most doses are already spoken for by governments. For a private organization such as the NHL to get a Covid-19 vaccine, it would need to buy excess supply from states on a secondary market or buy from another country. In India, for example, the vaccine will be for sale on private markets. The US government turned down a chance to secure more of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine over the summer, and the drugmaker could theoretically sell that excess production to a private entity, though it’s unclear how likely a scenario that is in the short term.

In the case of the NHL, for example, the league would presumably go through Canada’s system to obtain vaccine doses. Its health minister told reporters that the country doesn’t “have any mechanisms to block corporations from purchasing on a private, contractual basis with corporations around the world.” Pfizer told Canada’s CTV News in response that its contract is with the federal government.

The future of work has vaccines in it

Getting access to the vaccine is part of the equation of how businesses will approach the issue, but it’s not all of it. There’s also the matter of getting the workforce to take it, and companies are still in the early stages of figuring out how that will go.

Apart from the broader (and misguided) anti-vaccination movement in the US, many Americans are particularly concerned about getting the Covid-19 vaccines so early. They’ve been given the go-ahead under the FDA’s emergency use authorization. And while there’s been plenty of testing of them, the vaccines are still new, and people are nervous.

Dana, a 55-year-old registered nurse in California (whose last name is being withheld for privacy reasons), told Recode that while she is happy to be among the first in line to be vaccinated, even some of her colleagues have expressed some concerns. “We have a group of people who are like, ‘I don’t know, I’m worried about this vaccine,’ even though obviously there are not vaccine deniers among those people,” she said. “I think that part of it is just the unknown quality of it.”

Health care workers are largely accustomed to being required to have certain vaccinations for their jobs, but regular workers aren’t. Sure, a lot of people are used to there being a flu vaccine campaign at work in the fall, but if you ignore it, it’s usually no big deal. That’s not the case with Covid-19.

Now one debate happening among industry leaders and businesses is how to talk to their workers about the Covid-19 vaccine and how far to go to get them to take it.

“People are looking at this issue now. It’s one of the more difficult ones to grapple with,” said Zumwalt, from the Consumer Brands Association.

“The short answer is that, in general, employers can mandate vaccines”

On the less aggressive end, employers are working on programs to educate their workers about the vaccine, its benefits, and its safety, and to make workers aware of their efforts to get them vaccinated. Uber sent a letter to its drivers and delivery people telling them the company believes they “should be near the front of the line for the vaccine” and that it is focused on ensuring “that if you choose to take the vaccine, you’re able to access it quickly and easily.” Some employers may start to consider incentives, such as vacation time or gift cards, for workers to get vaccinated.

On the more aggressive end, there is the possibility of employers requiring workers to get a Covid-19 vaccine. It’s likely within their legal capabilities, said Lindsay Ryan, an employment lawyer based in California. “The short answer is that, in general, employers can mandate vaccines,” she told Recode.

Requiring vaccines isn’t a new phenomenon in some professions — it’s something that health care workers and teachers deal with. And plenty of jobs come with certain parameters that rule people out. Some employers have strict policies about hiring people with drunk driving convictions or who don’t pass drug tests, for example. CNN recently reported that nearly three-quarters of CEOs polled at a virtual summit held by Yale signaled they would be open to vaccine mandates.

“I could see a lot of employers doing that, but it does presume that there’s a vaccine available. You can’t tell your workforce you have to get vaccinated or you’re fired but you can’t get a vaccine,” said Salmon, who opposes government-mandated vaccinations.

The situation isn’t straightforward. On the one hand, Covid-19 is a more direct threat to workforces than the flu, and so the analysis around requiring it will take that into account. On the other hand, the vaccine being under emergency use authorization could make mandating it more unpalatable for employers. Even if they can do it, they might not want to. Employers have an obligation to maintain a safe and healthy workforce, including infection mitigation procedures, but mandating a vaccine comes with special obligations in terms of liability. And some people are going to need waivers.

Benjamin, from the American Public Health Association, said that understanding not everyone will get the vaccine, whatever their situation, is baked into public health planning. “At the end of the day, that’s why we push for herd immunity. We realize there is a population of people who won’t be able to vaccinate early, and there’s a population of people who won’t be able to vaccinate at all,” said Benjamin, who estimates about 75 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity.

Ryan said she doubts employers will go so far as to fire employees who won’t get vaccinated, but they could use other measures, such as placing them on unpaid leave or having them work remotely. In the case of companies like DoorDash and Uber that work with contractors, they can pretty much do whatever they want when it comes to asking people to get vaccines. Just because employers, at the federal level, can mandate vaccines for workers “doesn’t necessarily mean that they should,” she said.

Wherever they fall on the list of priorities, phase 1b, 1c, whatever’s next, businesses lobbying for the vaccine now have a lot of decisions ahead of them. The ethics of the situation are far from clear.

2020-12-21 14:41:41+00:00,14,"The need for widespread vaccination against Covid-19 is urgent — experts say about 60 percent of people need to be vaccinated to see the vaccine’s effect on the disease that has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 Americans. But the country must first surmount a considerable challenge: convincing many everyday Americans, not just skeptics, to get vaccinated.

This challenge will be doubly tough in Black and brown communities, where the coronavirus has disproportionately decimated families and where distrust of government and medical institutions remains high.

In November, Pew found that Black adults are “much less likely to say they would get a vaccine than other Americans.” Only 32 percent of Black adults say they would definitely or probably get a vaccine, compared with 52 percent of white respondents, 56 percent of Hispanic respondents, and about 72 percent of Asian respondents, according to Pew. Similarly, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s December vaccine monitor found that Black Americans are among the most hesitant when it comes to the vaccine — 35 percent say they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated — because they don’t trust vaccines in general or are worried they might get Covid-19 from it. The same report found that about half of Black adults are not confident that they were considered in the vaccine development process; over a third of Hispanic adults say the same about their needs being considered.

Distrust of government and institutions is rooted in a long history of state-sanctioned malpractice. One of the most infamous examples is the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, conducted by the US Public Health Service. From 1932 to 1972, researchers lied to around 600 Black men about their participation, telling them they were being monitored for “bad blood” when they were actually being studied to understand the impact of syphilis in the human body. The government also intentionally withheld penicillin (which was discovered as a reliable cure for syphilis during the course of the study) from the men who suffered and eventually died of the disease.

The distrust is also a response to a well-documented history of not being taken seriously by doctors and being undertreated for pain due to medical racism. It’s hard to repair trust that’s essentially never been earned — enslaved Africans who were brought to America endured centuries of medical exploitation.

Though the Kaiser monitor summarized Black and Hispanic attitudes as largely hesitant, it did find an inkling of hope: With each monthly accounting of attitudes, more members of each group say they will get the vaccine than say they will not, suggesting that vaccine hesitancy can be reduced with more information. Researchers are confident that communication and clarity about the efficacy and potential side effects of the vaccine can go a long way to change attitudes.

This outlook is already in effect on the ground in Camden, New Jersey, a city that is about 92 percent Black and brown and where one in every 14 residents has been infected with the coronavirus. There, the health department has launched an on-the-ground effort in which a team of ambassadors has been tasked with knocking on as many doors as possible to persuade residents to take the vaccine. According to Camden County health director Paschal Nwako, people’s attitudes about the vaccine have already changed since the team knocked on the first door in November.

“We’ve had individuals who open their door, then close it back on the first day. Then on the next day, they open the door and listen to us for a minute, then close it. Then the next day, they open their door and engage us for five minutes,” Nwako told Vox. “It’s not easy, but we stick with them because we know it’s the only way we can get the community the right information.”

Nwako talked to Vox about the challenges and opportunities ahead with getting Camden residents to take the vaccine. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Camden City has the highest infection rate in the Greater Philadelphia region, with 5,583 cases of coronavirus as of December 11. For comparison, Camden has nearly twice as many cases as the neighboring and largely white Cherry Hill neighborhood, though they have about the same number of residents. Why is this happening in Camden?

Paschal Nwako

In Camden, much of the population lives in multigenerational housing. There is also higher density housing in Camden. There are pockets of essential workers that could have been exposed to the virus in their front-line jobs, like people that work in restaurants and grocery stores. There are also undocumented populations who are worried about reaching out for public health information. So if there are people who live in close quarters, like families that live in one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments, it’s easier for the virus to spread. In Cherry Hill, people are able to spread out. The positivity rate we are seeing comes from people congregating together because they are family-oriented. That’s why around the Thanksgiving holiday, we were telling the community to stay within their own bubbles.

And now, we are seeing more cases in people ages 30 to 42 on average; during the first wave, from March to June, it was people ages 65-plus. But while we are seeing more positive cases in younger people, these people aren’t ending up in the hospital or dying in the same way people died during the first wave.

Fabiola Cineas

The Pfizer vaccine is already in use at Camden’s Cooper University Hospital downtown. What does this mean for the city?

Paschal Nwako

The vaccine is being administered to health care workers at Cooper Hospital during the first phase. They are looking at vaccinating 8,800 employees and expect to take up to a month to do that. Right now, we are in phase 1a, which is health care workers and long-term care residents. From there, we go to phase 1b, which are other essential workers — police officers, firefighters, EMT and EMS workers, people who work in jails, as well as people who work in dental offices, pharmacies, restaurants, supermarkets, and warehouses doing food distribution. These people are essential because without their services like food and health care, we cannot provide what citizens need to survive.

Then we go to phase 1c, which are adults ages 65 and above and all adults with high-risk medical conditions. And then we go into phase 2, which is the general public and should happen sometime in March.

We know that there is vaccine hesitancy, especially among minorities. We have to work hard to make sure that we partner with Camden City residents to disseminate Covid vaccination information in the county, targeting minorities — Hispanics, African Americans, and also faith-based communities in Camden City.

Fabiola Cineas

Studies have shown that Black Americans are among the most hesitant on the vaccine primarily because they’re worried about side effects and also don’t trust the development process. Why is this the case, and have you noticed this kind of reasoning among Camden residents?

Paschal Nwako

Vaccine hesitancy is a barrier among minority populations because of the history in these communities of the testing of medications and vaccines on them in the past. That’s a problem. We are training ambassadors in the community to convince the rest of the community that the vaccine is safe to take.

But while we know there is hesitancy, we expect that to change now that the vaccine is here. People are going to see people like them taking the vaccine. So if we were to give that survey again, we expect the number of people willing to take the vaccine to increase.

And bear in mind that by the time we get this vaccine to the general public in Camden, the number of people that will have taken this vaccine will have increased tremendously. And without side effects between now and then, people will be more willing to take the vaccine. Just like every other product that is new on the market, there will be a hesitancy. People will eventually feel more comfortable to start using it.

Fabiola Cineas

The same Kaiser Family Foundation study revealed that there’s also a fear that there won’t be equitable distribution of the vaccine, that there might not be enough vaccines for certain communities. Is this a fear you’ve come across while on the ground? And what is the county doing to make sure this isn’t a reality?

Paschal Nwako

There’s no such fear here. Everyone will be going through New Jersey’s vaccine scheduling system. It is open to the public, all New Jersey residents, and doesn’t discriminate. Everyone has to sign on and just choose a site. We have ample vaccines that will be coming through from Moderna, and we expect to get more from Pfizer, and also AstraZeneca down the line in March, when they get their emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Fabiola Cineas

Can you say more about the role these vaccine ambassadors are playing in the community? Why did the health department choose to launch this initiative, and what’s the impact been so far?

Paschal Nwako

People are sometimes confused about what they read or hear on the television. So when somebody in their community calls them on the phone, or sends them a text that will end up with a phone call to discuss the vaccines with them, that is more effective.

Since there are high-density living spots in Camden City, if we go into a building and stay in the lobby, we are able to engage people when they come down and get on and off the elevators. We can talk to them briefly there. Then when we get up to the second floor, 10th floor, 12th floor to have more conversations standing 10 feet apart, people are more responsive having seen us in the lobby. That person will be more open to speaking with you than a person who has not seen you before.

That strategy has been working because we are engaging with them by giving them masks, telling them where to go to get tested for coronavirus, and how to social distance.

So far, we have knocked on 52,646 doors, made 57,802 phone calls, sent 37,858 text messages, and conducted 991 wellness check shifts throughout the city.

Fabiola Cineas

Wow! And you’ve also been conducting a vaccine study. What have you been asking residents, and what do you hope the survey can help your team do?

Paschal Nwako

We ask them if they have taken a vaccine before, how they feel about taking vaccines, whether they feel like vaccines can prevent diseases, the side effects they have had in the past when they took a vaccine, and how they feel about the Covid vaccine coming down the pike.

We plan to use the information from this survey for a health education campaign in the community to build trust for the vaccine. We already have health educational materials that we are floating around Camden City. We’re giving it out to the churches that usually send it out to their members or when they come in on Sundays. Information packets are located at the front of churches for people to collect, for example.

Moderna informed us that an African American woman was the lead in producing the Moderna vaccine. So that will help reduce the anxiety and fear in the community over the efficacy of the vaccine.

Fabiola Cineas

What do you think the rest of the country can learn from what your team is doing in Camden around vaccine hesitancy?

Paschal Nwako

We know that it’s better to deal with communities when you are right there with them. If we go door to door, it means that we are right in the community and it means that we are engaging with them right there on the street, in front of their homes. And then we stick with them.

What we are also seeing is that the community needs employment — this is the highest want and need. People don’t want the government to hand them over money. They don’t want them to hand them over food. We have provided them with food, sometimes four times a week with the food bank we provide. They know where to get food. We provide them with masks and all the information they need to get tests and to take the vaccine, and they say, now what? We need a place to go work. Camden was hit with high unemployment as a result of the pandemic. [In April, Camden’s unemployment rate jumped to 15.1 percent from under 5 percent in March 2020; the unemployment rate was 7.1 percent in October, the latest month for which data is available.]

Fabiola Cineas

As we close out a year that has been very tough for Camden residents, what brings you hope as we move into 2021 for administering the vaccine in Camden?

Paschal Nwako

The best hope is that we expect that the end is in sight. But we also know that a vaccine does not equate to vaccinations. Having vaccines but not vaccinating is no good. The good news is, though, that we expect the hesitancy to reduce by March. When the community sees that people are not developing any side effects or dying suddenly because of the vaccine, they will be open to taking it.",voxdotcom,"['black', 'trust', 'residents', 'community', 'health', 'vaccine', 'communities', 'say', 'need', 'latinx', 'city', 'open', 'building', 'camden', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-21 13:10:11+00:00,18,"Americans have spent much of the Covid-19 pandemic blaming one another for the coronavirus’s spread.

Don’t go to that beach or park. Don’t go to that bar or restaurant. Don’t do anything for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Wear a mask! You don’t want to kill Grandma, do you?

Public officials have joined in. Increasingly, they are blaming private gatherings, not the restaurants and bars they insist on keeping open, for the spread of the disease. In some places, such as the Dakotas, framing Covid-19 prevention as an individual responsibility became the core of the strategy to fight Covid-19. As cases and deaths climbed to among the highest rates in the world, South Dakota’s leaders preached “personal responsibility” and refused to require masks, much less stricter measures. Ian Fury, a spokesperson for Gov. Kristi Noem (R), told me his boss gave citizens “up-to-date science, facts, and data, and then trusted them to make the best decisions for themselves and their loved ones.”

It’s true that individuals have an important role in fighting Covid-19. Everyone should wear a mask, and, unfortunately, everyone should reconsider big family gatherings this holiday season. But relying on individual action to fight a deadly virus — an approach that the US has leveraged for problems ranging from the opioid crisis to global warming — simply hasn’t worked.

Today, America is among the worst performers at fighting Covid-19. Despite recent surges in Europe and Israel, the US remains within the top 20 percent for most coronavirus deaths per person among developed nations, with more than twice the death rate as the median developed country. If the US managed the same Covid-19 death rate as Canada, more than 190,000 Americans would likely be alive today.

There are many reasons for that, not least President Donald Trump’s awful leadership. But part of it, experts say, is America’s inability to address structural problems, instead relying on demanding more from individuals. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, highlighted this problem when he remarked that the “independent spirit in the United States of people not wanting to comply with public health measures has certainly hurt us a bit.”

That was clear in much of the public’s response to lockdowns starting in the spring. With “Don’t Tread on Me” flags hoisted in the background, protesters often took to statehouses to demand the end of government-mandated closures. At the demonstrations, attendees claimed they could take care of themselves and didn’t need the government to tell them what to do.

It’s also been apparent in the government responses. The emphasis on individualism helps explain why Trump and his conservative allies, like Noem, have resisted more government mandates on masks and stay-at-home orders in lieu of letting people deal with the virus for themselves.

But it’s not just Trump and friends. Every state in the country, Democratic or Republican, has at some point reopened restaurants or bars, allowing people to congregate in indoor areas that experts widely agree are breeding grounds for Covid-19. While resisting shutting down such places, local and state officials have argued that it’s on people to wear masks, cancel private gatherings for the holidays, and avoid nonessential activities — while leaving room for people to not follow at least some of those guidelines. Every state in the country has also, subsequently, seen surges in the coronavirus this fall.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo exemplified the failure of this approach. In the lead-up to Thanksgiving, he said, “My personal advice is you don’t have family gatherings — even for Thanksgiving.” Days later, it came out that Cuomo was planning to host a family gathering with his 89-year-old mother and two of his three adult daughters. He only canceled after a public backlash. Even Cuomo wasn’t planning on following his own advice. (Cuomo’s office argued his comments were misinterpreted.)

Meanwhile, much less attention has gone to addressing Covid-19 from a truly structural perspective. The coronavirus has revealed America’s pathetic public health infrastructure — there’s still no national testing-and-tracing program, and no state has an adequate contact tracing program, if they have such a program at all. Businesses and workers have been left to fend for themselves, as Congress failed to pass an economic relief bill before the last one started to expire. For all the talk about outdoor activities being safer during the coronavirus pandemic, there’s been next to no action in most of the country on getting people outside — at times, governments have even eliminated outdoor venues by closing parks or beaches.

“It’s a structural issue,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “Systemic challenges in the United States — that predate the pandemic but have gotten worse [during the pandemic] — lead to the situation we’re in.”

It’s easy to yell at people over their Covid-19 failures — simply log on to Twitter and blast away. It’s costless for a governor to tell people that it’s on them to stop the spread of the coronavirus by voluntarily giving up things they love, especially if the same governor doesn’t even plan on following his own advice.

So rather than do anything about it, Americans are stuck blaming each other for Covid-19. But until we truly realize this is a collective failure, not an individual one, the problems will linger.

Structural problems are really to blame here

Since the start of America’s epidemic, experts have warned that indoor dining and bars are among the worst places for the spread of Covid-19: People are in poorly ventilated indoor areas where the virus spreads more easily sit close for possibly hours, can’t wear masks as they eat or drink, and spew germs at each other as they shout, sing, and laugh.

So many experts have called on governments to close bars and restaurants. Acknowledging the economic toll of this, economists and public health experts have also asked for a bailout of the industry to make employers and their workers whole until the pandemic resides.

None of that happened. Instead, America started to reopen before Covid-19 cases were under control — at the US’s best point in the spring and summer, it still had more than 60 times the daily new cases of Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea — with bars and restaurants reopening in every state by the fall. Public officials acknowledged the risks but merely moved to limit capacity and called on everyone to be responsible by physical distancing, wearing a mask, and limiting contact with people from other households.

This has not gone well. Coronavirus cases have shot up across much of the country, with the US in the middle of its third and biggest surge of Covid-19 yet. At the same time, we’ve gotten more data showing how dangerous bars and restaurants can be for the spread of Covid-19: A study published in the Journal of Korean Medical Science found that a person in South Korea may have been infected with Covid-19 in a restaurant in as little as five minutes. Another study in Nature found, “Reopening full-service restaurants was associated with a particularly high risk.”

Despite that, officials across the country have by and large resisted shutting down again. Many of them, instead, have cited another culprit for Covid-19 spread: private gatherings. New York, for example, put out a PSA to stop “living room spread,” and the state published data suggesting households and private gatherings are driving 74 percent of coronavirus spread.

It’s true private gatherings and households are driving some transmission. Most experts agree Thanksgiving dinners likely led to a surge on top of a surge, and similar Christmas and New Year’s events likely will too.

But that’s why at least some experts believe there’s a need for more focus on systemic action, not the individualistic approach. “People, in general, are horrendous risk assessors — we’re awful at assessing risk,” Daniel Goldberg, a medical historian and public health ethicist at the University of Colorado, told me. “I hate to say people can’t be trusted, but.”

There are other problems with this framing. For one, the New York data doesn’t separate within-household transmissions from social gatherings — so the 74 percent figure includes someone spreading Covid-19 to the husband he lives with (not as avoidable) and someone spreading the virus to someone he invited over for drinks one night (very avoidable). This also only includes the cases that New York could actually contact trace, and it’s much easier to trace transmission between family and friends in a household than strangers in a bar.

The big problem, though, is that there’s nothing unusual about Covid-19 spreading among people who live together. It’s typical for the bulk, even the majority, of the transmission of any disease to happen within households. If you’re infected, the people you live with or come into close contact with at home are simply likely to get it too. That’s how pathogens work. What matters most, though, is where that virus originated from in the first place.

To put it another way: People couldn’t infect others in their homes if they hadn’t picked up the coronavirus in bars, restaurants, or other public spaces. So if these places weren’t open, individual choices to gather — including over Thanksgiving and Christmas — would be of far less concern. There would simply be much less virus out there jumping from person to person.

So it largely comes down to the lack of systemic action, not solely the individual choice.

It’s not just bars and restaurants. If officials want people to wear masks, they can mandate masks and actually enforce those mandates. If they want more adults to stay home, they can replace any income individuals might lose by not going into work, or take steps to make work-from-home life more bearable, like deeming schools “essential” or subsidizing day care. If they want people to stay outdoors and not indoors, they can do things that can encourage people to go outside instead of congregating inside — like offering free outdoor activities like ice skating or art installations, or even just places to eat (with some heating during the winter) — rather than shutting down parks. If they want to address racial disparities for Covid-19, they need to address systemic racial disparities across society and health care.

Otherwise, we’re going to be stuck with relying on people to make decisions — almost always against their own social, cultural, and economic interests — to do the right thing. So far, that just isn’t working.

It’s easier to blame individuals than fix big problems

Public leaders and government officials face their own structural forces too.

Brown University School of Public Health dean Ashish Jha told me of a recent conversation with a governor. Jha argued that risky indoor spaces like bars and restaurants should be closed, or hospitals will soon overflow. The governor responded that such closures would require money to support affected businesses and their employees, and the state simply doesn’t have that money. The governor added, “Maybe I should spend a little bit of money and try to campaign for people to be more careful” — a pivot to an individualistic approach.

“I came to appreciate that, ultimately, the problem wasn’t this governor,” Jha said. He later added, “The right answer is not we need better governors — the right answer is we need a different structure and a better federal government.”

Structural issues are, almost by definition, much harder to fix than simply asking people to do the right thing. It’s easy and cheap to yell at people for getting together for Christmas — especially when they really shouldn’t be doing it. Closing down bars and supporting them economically, in turn, requires both political and financial capital.

In some cases, governments legitimately can’t do what they would prefer. Local and state officials, unlike the federal government, can’t print money and usually have to balance their budgets. Given that reality, a governor might decide that she has to keep bars open simply because she can’t bail them out — the economic cost is so high, and, who knows, maybe the state might get lucky and avoid an outbreak anyway. States, counties, and cities face a structural barrier in the federal government’s inaction.

There’s a cultural component, too. Americans pride themselves on their individualistic and libertarian qualities — what Fauci described as an “independent spirit in the United States.” That creates an innate resistance, among the public and its leaders, to look at problems in a collective over an individual manner. So with Covid-19, we yell at people for not distancing or wearing masks in bars, but not as much at public officials for allowing that bar to open in the first place.

The truth, as Covid-19 has shown us, is this individualistic approach doesn’t work well for public health (even if it does serve us well in other areas). The alternative to not taking collective action is more death. The countries that have done the best against Covid-19 — including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and, to a now lesser degree, Germany — all approached the issue collectively, leveraging government aid and public health systems to let people stay home without losing as much income or health insurance, to test and trace infections, and, when necessary, to close down to stop the spread.

In fact, America’s best — and perhaps only — success against Covid-19 so far came about with the power of collective action. The vaccines that are now being shot into the arms of health care workers and people in nursing homes came about with the strong support of various governments, which funded research or, at the very least, paid for tens of millions of doses before the vaccines were even proven to work. Crucially, this came about by acknowledging the structural risks involved in developing a vaccine, particularly that drug companies might be reluctant to gamble on the medications if they may not pan out, and mitigated those risks.

The problem runs deeper than what America did and can do about Covid-19 alone. One advantage that other countries had as the pandemic began is stronger social safety nets, which guaranteed people would retain some income and health care even if a lockdown was needed. The US has no such guarantees — the programs that do exist are notoriously underfunded (hence Congress needing to boost unemployment insurance in its economic relief bills), and far from universal. So while British and German workers could rely on some significant government support even if they lost their jobs, Americans could claim no such certainty.

We see that today. Even as Congress nears a deal on economic relief, the truth is it’s already too late for many Americans. With much of the previous stimulus measure expiring, people who lost their jobs have languished for months with little to no support. And even if the new deal passes Congress (which is still uncertain), there will likely be a lag in actually rolling out those benefits to the people who need them, leading to more prolonged suffering. It could have been avoided if these kinds of benefits were permanent, or kicked in automatically if the economy begins to weaken, as government programs in other developed countries do.

That’s just one example. From building up the social safety net to actually funding public health infrastructure to reforming government so it’s more responsive, there’s a lot of work America could do to make sure it’s better equipped to handle crises as they come up. That won’t completely end the need for leadership in troubled times — European countries with large social safety nets have still passed additional economic relief measures — but it would put the US in a much better place.

It won’t be easy. It means committing to a more hands-on governing structure, costing us more in dollars and cents and forcing many Americans to rethink how they view the role of government.

But if Covid-19 has taught us anything, those changes are worth the cost. It begins with taking a structural, rather than individualistic, view of the problems facing the US today.",voxdotcom,"['public', 'officials', 'solely', 'individuals', 'covid19', 'health', 'cant', 'state', 'coronavirus', 'structural', 'america', 'restaurants', 'bars', 'stop', 'gatherings', 'rely']",0
2020-12-21 01:21:17+00:00,77,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-12-20 11:01:18+00:00,12,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2020-12-19 14:49:08+00:00,23,"After months of waiting, we finally have detailed information on the safety and efficacy of the first Covid-19 vaccines that will be distributed in America.

On Thursday, a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration voted to recommend the Moderna vaccine for an emergency use authorization for people ages 18 and over. Ahead of the decision, the agency shared the most comprehensive data to date on what we know about the shot. The same process happened last week with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is now being rolled out across America following an EUA Friday night.

While both vaccines had already been shown to be highly effective, the new data provides a much more granular picture of their side effects and safety profiles.

What’s now clear: An injection with either vaccine, both of which use mRNA technology, can feel more intense than other routine vaccinations (such as the flu shot) — with side effects for some recipients such as pain, headache, and fatigue. And this may be especially true for Moderna’s vaccine: About 16 percent of people who got the shot in clinical trials experienced a “severe” systemic adverse reaction, a classification the FDA uses to refer to side effects, like fever or fatigue, that require medical attention and prevent people from going about their daily activities.

“We should anticipate that if you got vaccinated that day, you may not want to go to work,” Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, said of the vaccines. That’s why health systems are being warned to stagger immunizing their workforces, to avoid “potential clustering of worker absenteeism,” as the vaccine expert group advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put it.

These side effects are known as reactogenicity, and vaccine developers and regulators allow for some level of reactogenicity in all approved vaccines. They can be a sign of the body’s immune response kicking into gear, said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.

I think it will be very important to communicate to the population that these vaccines have more reactogenicity (injection site pain, transient fatigue, headache, elev temp) than most other licensed vaccines. Not dangerous but unpleasant. People need to know what to expect. https://t.co/51R1J8vRKQ — Florian Krammer (@florian_krammer) December 2, 2020

“Think about [reactogenicity] as mouthwash — it’s hurting while it’s working,” Omer said. “The key is to prepare people to know this will happen — this may hurt a little, give you a bit of fever — but these are short-term, known side effects that you need to be aware of.”

The stakes for clearly communicating information about each vaccine’s risks and benefits are high: More than a quarter of Americans reported that they would probably or definitely refuse to take a Covid-19 vaccine, according to a late-summer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, even if it were freely available and deemed safe by regulators. And with the virus spreading farther and faster in America than just about anywhere else in the world, it’s critical that people don’t feel caught off guard by the side effects or spread misinformation about the vaccine.

To achieve that, transparency is key, said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth professor of political science who has been thinking about how to build confidence in the Covid-19 vaccines. “Millions of people are going to get this vaccine, and we know huge numbers of people are going to have normal side effects, which are often indicating that the vaccine is working. We want to build trust with people so there are no surprises when that happens.”

In that spirit, here’s what we know about the side effects of these two shots and how to think about them.

What mild and moderate side effects really mean

Before we get into the weeds, it’s helpful to understand how these companies classify side effects in the first place. In general, vaccine developers seeking approval in the US market use the FDA’s “toxicity assessment scale” to grade side effects and other adverse events from 1 to 4, from mild and moderate to severe and life-threatening.

Grade 1 “mild” side effects are generally easily tolerated and don’t interfere with a person’s regular activities. Grade 2 “moderate” effects may interfere with regular activities, grade 3 “severe” effects are incapacitating and need medical attention, and grade 4 are “potentially life-threatening,” usually requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization. Let’s use the example of headache following vaccination. Here’s how the FDA would classify it:

Mild: “No interference with activity”

Moderate: “Repeated use of nonnarcotic pain reliever > 24 hours or some interference with activity”

Severe: “Any use of narcotic pain reliever or prevents daily activity”

Potentially life-threatening: “ER visit or hospitalization”

So a mild side effect is one you’d notice but doesn’t require any special care or keep you from living your life; a moderate side effect can keep you home from work but doesn’t warrant medical intervention; severe adverse events require medical care and definitely interfere with your normal life; and potentially life-threatening is just what it sounds like and usually involves a visit to or stay in the hospital.

In vaccine studies, these events are broken down into “local” reactions (meaning they’re specific to one part of the body, like pain or tenderness where the vaccine is injected) and “systemic,” whole-body reactions (like fever or fatigue).

For a vaccine to win FDA approval, any reactions people have during clinical trials have to be mostly mild and moderate. And that’s because the safety bar for vaccines is really high, even compared to medicines.

Vaccines “are given to healthy people who have in many cases absolutely nothing wrong with them. And we are talking about [giving them] to literally billions of people. Even rare side effects if they’re serious matter enormously,” said Charles Weijer, a professor of medicine and an ethicist at Western University in Canada. “We’re more willing to accept adverse effects [with drugs], provided those are counterbalanced by benefits to the patient.”

Mostly mild and moderate side effects are the safety profiles of both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines — and that’s why the FDA in the US and drug regulators in other countries around the world are rushing to bring them to market. But there are important differences between the two vaccines.

What we know about Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech side effects

Now let’s look at the best data we’ve got on the vaccines. It comes from the FDA’s analyses of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials ahead of their emergency use authorization meetings on December 10 for Pfizer/BioNTech and December 17 for Moderna. (The companies also released their own data for the meeting, but we focused on the agency’s independent reviews here.)

The reviews show the vaccines are both safe and that they’re extremely good at preventing Covid-19 infections (with around a 95 percent efficacy rate). That’s hugely important at a time when more than 3,000 Americans are dying from Covid-19 each day on average.

They also give a sense of what side effects we might expect when these vaccines are rolled out. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine caused mild or moderate reactions in most people, and severe reactions were rare. Moderna didn’t share the details of its vaccine trial’s mild and moderate side effects, but the FDA said mild and moderate is how they’d characterize the bulk of them. A key difference with the Moderna vaccine, however, is that we know severe reactions were more common in the trials.

Let’s get into what this means, but with a couple of caveats first. Because we have no head-to-head study of the two vaccines and the companies haven’t reported side effect data in the same way, doing apples-to-apples comparisons is tricky, said Hilda Bastian, an expert in reading medical evidence who has been analyzing the coronavirus vaccine data. The vaccines also come in different doses: 30µg in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech and 100µg with Moderna. While they’re supposed to be delivered in two shots per person, the time intervals are different: The Pfizer/BioNTech shots are three weeks apart, and Moderna’s are four weeks.

Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna also tested their products on different populations. “Some of the differences affect risks and so could be affecting outcomes,” said Bastian. For example, there were more people of Hispanic/Latino background and with chronic lung disease in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial than the Moderna trial, she added. And in the real world, when the vaccines roll out to millions, the side effects may again look different.

With all that in mind, here’s what we know about each shot. For Pfizer/BioNTech the most common side effects overall, according to the FDA’s analysis of the data, were local reactions at the site of injection (including pain, redness, swelling), fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Again, these were mostly classified as mild or moderate. Severe reactions, meanwhile, were rare — occurring in 0 to 4.6 percent of participants, depending on the specific side effect.

In general, side effects popped up more after the second dose than the first. They also happened less frequently in people 55 and younger, the FDA said. You can see the breakdown of adverse events data in younger adults (18-55) in the chart below following dose 1 and, if you click through, following dose 2. (Note: Pfizer/BioNTech found no potentially life-threatening (grade 4) adverse reactions linked to the vaccine in the population they analyzed for safety.)

Now let’s look at the FDA’s Moderna data. Again, the company didn’t share the details of their mild and moderate adverse events — and revealed fewer details than Pfizer/BioNTech generally. But we know the most common reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, and chills.

Though the FDA said these were mostly mild and moderate, we only have the specific figures for total events and the more severe reactions. For example, 83 percent of study participants experienced a systemic adverse reaction of any level of severity while 15.7 percent experienced a severe “systemic” adverse reaction and 7 percent, a severe “local” reaction. Depending on the type, these severe events ranged in frequency from 0.2 to 9.7 percent.

Like the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, side effects were more frequent after the second dose and less common overall in adults 65 and older. Side effects that required hospitalization or emergency room visit were extremely rare. According to FDA analysis, “Across groups and doses, <0.1% reported a Grade 4 systemic reaction.” You can see that below, in a chart focusing on safety data in the younger adults in the study.

So what can we take away from all this?

“We know neither of these vaccines carries a high risk of serious adverse events. And we can expect them to cause typical reactions to vaccines,” said Bastian. But there are important differences. At least in these trials, all side effects and especially severe side effects were more common with the Moderna vaccine.

“The overall picture is that almost everyone has systemic adverse events with Moderna’s vaccine, and we don’t know how often they were only mild,” Bastian said. “For Pfizer/BioNTech, most people had at least mild reactions, but moderate reactions were common too.” So, at least for now, it seems reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine “are considerably less severe.”

The vaccines “are on the fairly reactive side compared to most vaccines we commonly use,” said Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University and a former FDA chief scientist. “It’s hard to compare between the two, but you do get the feeling these systemic reactions like muscle and joint aches are maybe more common in the Moderna vaccine than Pfizer.” Goodman also noted that rates of adverse reactions in Moderna’s placebo groups were higher, and side effects were generally less severe in people who had already been infected with Covid-19.

For the general population, though, there isn’t anything to fear with either vaccine. Again, side effects, if they do pop up, will be mostly moderate or mild. And this doesn’t come as a surprise to vaccine researchers. “The side effects [we’re seeing] are symptoms associated with products of the immune system — cytokines — that are recruited when fighting an infection or responding to a vaccine,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “That’s why people over 65 have a lesser rate of these side effects than younger people — just evidence of a more senescent immune system.”

There’s still a lot to learn about these vaccines

Even with all the available data, there are still unknowns about the two vaccines. We may not see additional rare side effects or severe reactions that will emerge until millions of people get them, for example.

Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, showed up in three people who got the Moderna vaccine and four people who got the Pfizer/BioNTech shot in the companies’ late-stage trials. It’s not yet clear whether these cases are actually linked with the vaccines — since Bell’s palsy can occur in the general population irrespective of vaccination — but because “we see a similar imbalance in two different studies, it pricks my ears up a bit,” Goodman said, and it’s something we’ll learn more about as the vaccines are rolled out.

There are also groups the vaccines weren’t tested in, like pregnant women and people with HIV. In the cases of anaphylaxis in the UK following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, two people with a history of severe allergies — the kind that force them to carry around EpiPen-type devices — had a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, were treated, and recovered. Allergic reactions were very rare in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial (affecting only 0.63 of people who got the vaccine, according to the FDA’s analysis). And people with severe allergies were also excluded from the study.

Clinical trials are not the real world of people; they all have inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Like no history of anaphylaxis (protocol ).

The CDC is now advising that people with a history of severe allergic reactions to vaccines can still get the Pfizer/BioNTech shot but should be counseled about the risks and be monitored for 30 minutes afterward, while those with an allergy to a specific vaccine ingredient shouldn’t get the shot.

Long-term Covid-19 vaccine side effects are “not really a thing”

But, again, there’s some reassurance to be taken here: Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are extremely rare generally. Most serious vaccine reactions — such as the rare neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome — tend to happen within six weeks of getting immunized, said Colleen Kelley, associate professor of medicine at Emory University, who is also a principal investigator in the Moderna trial. And we already have more than six weeks of data on safety and side effects in the two shots.

“People worry about late or long-term side effects occurring a year or two later — that’s not really a thing with vaccination,” Kelley said.

Instead of taking a large dose of medication for many years, where a side effect may surface only after lots of exposure, with vaccines, Bastian said, you’re getting a small dose to stimulate an immune reaction once or a few times. So it makes sense that the longer-term risks aren’t a major problem.

Again, though, this doesn’t mean all coronavirus vaccines are entirely safe or that there’s not more to learn about these two. And as other Covid-19 vaccines hit the market, clarity and transparency about what we know will be paramount if we want people to trust and take the vaccines, Bastian said. “The evidence says treat people like adults. Tell people the truth. Anything else is manipulation and that’s a form of lying.”

2020-12-19 11:58:29+00:00,13,"The need for widespread vaccination against Covid-19 is urgent — experts say about 60 percent of people need to be vaccinated to see the vaccine’s effect on the disease that has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 Americans. But the country must first surmount a considerable challenge: convincing many everyday Americans, not just skeptics, to get vaccinated.

This challenge will be doubly tough in Black and brown communities, where the coronavirus has disproportionately decimated families and where distrust of government and medical institutions remains high.

In November, Pew found that Black adults are “much less likely to say they would get a vaccine than other Americans.” Only 32 percent of Black adults say they would definitely or probably get a vaccine, compared with 52 percent of white respondents, 56 percent of Hispanic respondents, and about 72 percent of Asian respondents, according to Pew. Similarly, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s December vaccine monitor found that Black Americans are among the most hesitant when it comes to the vaccine — 35 percent say they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated — because they don’t trust vaccines in general or are worried they might get Covid-19 from it. The same report found that about half of Black adults are not confident that they were considered in the vaccine development process; over a third of Hispanic adults say the same about their needs being considered.

Distrust of government and institutions is rooted in a long history of state-sanctioned malpractice. One of the most infamous examples is the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, conducted by the US Public Health Service. From 1932 to 1972, researchers lied to around 600 Black men about their participation, telling them they were being monitored for “bad blood” when they were actually being studied to understand the impact of syphilis in the human body. The government also intentionally withheld penicillin (which was discovered as a reliable cure for syphilis during the course of the study) from the men who suffered and eventually died of the disease.

The distrust is also a response to a well-documented history of not being taken seriously by doctors and being undertreated for pain due to medical racism. It’s hard to repair trust that’s essentially never been earned — enslaved Africans who were brought to America endured centuries of medical exploitation.

Though the Kaiser monitor summarized Black and Hispanic attitudes as largely hesitant, it did find an inkling of hope: With each monthly accounting of attitudes, more members of each group say they will get the vaccine than say they will not, suggesting that vaccine hesitancy can be reduced with more information. Researchers are confident that communication and clarity about the efficacy and potential side effects of the vaccine can go a long way to change attitudes.

This outlook is already in effect on the ground in Camden, New Jersey, a city that is about 92 percent Black and brown and where one in every 14 residents has been infected with the coronavirus. There, the health department has launched an on-the-ground effort in which a team of ambassadors has been tasked with knocking on as many doors as possible to persuade residents to take the vaccine. According to Camden County health director Paschal Nwako, people’s attitudes about the vaccine have already changed since the team knocked on the first door in November.

“We’ve had individuals who open their door, then close it back on the first day. Then on the next day, they open the door and listen to us for a minute, then close it. Then the next day, they open their door and engage us for five minutes,” Nwako told Vox. “It’s not easy, but we stick with them because we know it’s the only way we can get the community the right information.”

Nwako talked to Vox about the challenges and opportunities ahead with getting Camden residents to take the vaccine. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Fabiola Cineas

Camden City has the highest infection rate in the Greater Philadelphia region, with 5,583 cases of coronavirus as of December 11. For comparison, Camden has nearly twice as many cases as the neighboring and largely white Cherry Hill neighborhood, though they have about the same number of residents. Why is this happening in Camden?

Paschal Nwako

In Camden, much of the population lives in multigenerational housing. There is also higher density housing in Camden. There are pockets of essential workers that could have been exposed to the virus in their front-line jobs, like people that work in restaurants and grocery stores. There are also undocumented populations who are worried about reaching out for public health information. So if there are people who live in close quarters, like families that live in one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments, it’s easier for the virus to spread. In Cherry Hill, people are able to spread out. The positivity rate we are seeing comes from people congregating together because they are family-oriented. That’s why around the Thanksgiving holiday, we were telling the community to stay within their own bubbles.

And now, we are seeing more cases in people ages 30 to 42 on average; during the first wave, from March to June, it was people ages 65-plus. But while we are seeing more positive cases in younger people, these people aren’t ending up in the hospital or dying in the same way people died during the first wave.

Fabiola Cineas

The Pfizer vaccine is already in use at Camden’s Cooper University Hospital downtown. What does this mean for the city?

Paschal Nwako

The vaccine is being administered to health care workers at Cooper Hospital during the first phase. They are looking at vaccinating 8,800 employees and expect to take up to a month to do that. Right now, we are in phase 1a, which is health care workers and long-term care residents. From there, we go to phase 1b, which are other essential workers — police officers, firefighters, EMT and EMS workers, people who work in jails, as well as people who work in dental offices, pharmacies, restaurants, supermarkets, and warehouses doing food distribution. These people are essential because without their services like food and health care, we cannot provide what citizens need to survive.

Then we go to phase 1c, which are adults ages 65 and above and all adults with high-risk medical conditions. And then we go into phase 2, which is the general public and should happen sometime in March.

We know that there is vaccine hesitancy, especially among minorities. We have to work hard to make sure that we partner with Camden City residents to disseminate Covid vaccination information in the county, targeting minorities — Hispanics, African Americans, and also faith-based communities in Camden City.

Fabiola Cineas

Studies have shown that Black Americans are among the most hesitant on the vaccine primarily because they’re worried about side effects and also don’t trust the development process. Why is this the case, and have you noticed this kind of reasoning among Camden residents?

Paschal Nwako

Vaccine hesitancy is a barrier among minority populations because of the history in these communities of the testing of medications and vaccines on them in the past. That’s a problem. We are training ambassadors in the community to convince the rest of the community that the vaccine is safe to take.

But while we know there is hesitancy, we expect that to change now that the vaccine is here. People are going to see people like them taking the vaccine. So if we were to give that survey again, we expect the number of people willing to take the vaccine to increase.

And bear in mind that by the time we get this vaccine to the general public in Camden, the number of people that will have taken this vaccine will have increased tremendously. And without side effects between now and then, people will be more willing to take the vaccine. Just like every other product that is new on the market, there will be a hesitancy. People will eventually feel more comfortable to start using it.

Fabiola Cineas

The same Kaiser Family Foundation study revealed that there’s also a fear that there won’t be equitable distribution of the vaccine, that there might not be enough vaccines for certain communities. Is this a fear you’ve come across while on the ground? And what is the county doing to make sure this isn’t a reality?

Paschal Nwako

There’s no such fear here. Everyone will be going through New Jersey’s vaccine scheduling system. It is open to the public, all New Jersey residents, and doesn’t discriminate. Everyone has to sign on and just choose a site. We have ample vaccines that will be coming through from Moderna, and we expect to get more from Pfizer, and also AstraZeneca down the line in March, when they get their emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Fabiola Cineas

Can you say more about the role these vaccine ambassadors are playing in the community? Why did the health department choose to launch this initiative, and what’s the impact been so far?

Paschal Nwako

People are sometimes confused about what they read or hear on the television. So when somebody in their community calls them on the phone, or sends them a text that will end up with a phone call to discuss the vaccines with them, that is more effective.

Since there are high-density living spots in Camden City, if we go into a building and stay in the lobby, we are able to engage people when they come down and get on and off the elevators. We can talk to them briefly there. Then when we get up to the second floor, 10th floor, 12th floor to have more conversations standing 10 feet apart, people are more responsive having seen us in the lobby. That person will be more open to speaking with you than a person who has not seen you before.

That strategy has been working because we are engaging with them by giving them masks, telling them where to go to get tested for coronavirus, and how to social distance.

So far, we have knocked on 52,646 doors, made 57,802 phone calls, sent 37,858 text messages, and conducted 991 wellness check shifts throughout the city.

Fabiola Cineas

Wow! And you’ve also been conducting a vaccine study. What have you been asking residents, and what do you hope the survey can help your team do?

Paschal Nwako

We ask them if they have taken a vaccine before, how they feel about taking vaccines, whether they feel like vaccines can prevent diseases, the side effects they have had in the past when they took a vaccine, and how they feel about the Covid vaccine coming down the pike.

We plan to use the information from this survey for a health education campaign in the community to build trust for the vaccine. We already have health educational materials that we are floating around Camden City. We’re giving it out to the churches that usually send it out to their members or when they come in on Sundays. Information packets are located at the front of churches for people to collect, for example.

Moderna informed us that an African American woman was the lead in producing the Moderna vaccine. So that will help reduce the anxiety and fear in the community over the efficacy of the vaccine.

Fabiola Cineas

What do you think the rest of the country can learn from what your team is doing in Camden around vaccine hesitancy?

Paschal Nwako

We know that it’s better to deal with communities when you are right there with them. If we go door to door, it means that we are right in the community and it means that we are engaging with them right there on the street, in front of their homes. And then we stick with them.

What we are also seeing is that the community needs employment — this is the highest want and need. People don’t want the government to hand them over money. They don’t want them to hand them over food. We have provided them with food, sometimes four times a week with the food bank we provide. They know where to get food. We provide them with masks and all the information they need to get tests and to take the vaccine, and they say, now what? We need a place to go work. Camden was hit with high unemployment as a result of the pandemic. [In April, Camden’s unemployment rate jumped to 15.1 percent from under 5 percent in March 2020; the unemployment rate was 7.1 percent in October, the latest month for which data is available.]

Fabiola Cineas

As we close out a year that has been very tough for Camden residents, what brings you hope as we move into 2021 for administering the vaccine in Camden?

Paschal Nwako

The best hope is that we expect that the end is in sight. But we also know that a vaccine does not equate to vaccinations. Having vaccines but not vaccinating is no good. The good news is, though, that we expect the hesitancy to reduce by March. When the community sees that people are not developing any side effects or dying suddenly because of the vaccine, they will be open to taking it.",voxdotcom,"['black', 'trust', 'residents', 'community', 'health', 'vaccine', 'communities', 'say', 'need', 'latinx', 'city', 'open', 'building', 'camden', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-19 00:57:46+00:00,27,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency use authorization for Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, clearing the way for it to be the second vaccine distributed in the United States. The decision follows a vote on Thursday by an advisory committee to the FDA which found that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its harms for people ages 18 years old and older.

“With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, in a statement.

Between the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that received a green light last week and the Moderna vaccine, US officials were expecting to have enough doses to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of the month. However, some states reported Thursday that they had received fewer doses than they were promised of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

Both of these vaccines use an mRNA platform to get human cells to make a component of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. That component, the spike protein of the virus, is then used by the immune system to build up protection against the pathogen. It’s an approach that is seeing widespread use in humans for the first time. Both vaccines are also administered as two doses; the doses of the Moderna vaccine are spaced 28 days apart, while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine doses are spread 21 days apart.

Moderna’s vaccine can be stored long-term at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2° and 8°C (36° to 46°F). In contrast, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs temperatures of minus 70°C (minus 94°F). The less stringent storage requirements of Moderna’s product may ease some of the logistical challenges of distributing a vaccine.

The task of getting delicate vaccines from manufacturers to hospitals and into the hands of patients is complicated, something that will have to be scaled up to immunize millions of people across the United States.

Already, the distribution of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has hit some bumps. State officials are reporting that their allocations of the vaccine have been suddenly downscaled, while Pfizer said that there are millions of doses of its vaccine that have gone unclaimed.

.@CDCgov has informed us that WA’s vaccine allocation will be cut by 40 percent next week — and that all states are seeing similar cuts.



This is disruptive and frustrating. We need accurate, predictable numbers to plan and ensure on-the-ground success.



No explanation was given. — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) December 17, 2020

Though having a second vaccine on the market increases the number of people who can get immunized, it could also complicate the distribution process further, with more doses to track, transport, and administer.

Health officials are also warning recipients about potential side effects of these vaccines. At least four people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine under an EUA experienced severe allergic reactions. While effects this severe are very rare, some doctors are pointing out that reactions to these vaccines can be more intense than responses to other inoculations, as Vox’s Julia Belluz explained:

What’s now clear: An injection with either vaccine, both of which use mRNA technology, can feel more intense than other routine vaccinations (such as the flu shot) — with side effects for some recipients such as pain, headache, and fatigue. And this may be especially true for Moderna’s vaccine: About 16 percent of people who got the shot in clinical trials experienced a “severe” systemic adverse reaction, a classification the FDA uses to refer to side effects, like fever or fatigue, that require medical attention and prevent people from going about their daily activities.

Per guidelines set by an advisory group for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the first people slated to receive the Moderna vaccine will be the same as those for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — health workers and residents and staff at long-term care facilities. The US government has purchased 100 million doses of each of these vaccines to be delivered through the end of March.

An EUA, however, is still short of a full approval, and there are still some outstanding concerns that need to be addressed. Moderna noted in its briefing document that the company is still trying to find out how long the vaccine’s protection lasts, how well it prevents transmission, and its long-term impacts. The company says it will monitor its trial pool for two years and will conduct additional studies among the people who receive the vaccine under an EUA to get answers to these questions.",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'received', 'authorization', 'moderna', 'emergency', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'fda', 'minus', 'states', 'second', 'effects', 'united', 'vaccines']",0

The distrust is also a response to a well-documented history of not being taken seriously by doctors and being undertreated for pain due to medical racism. It’s hard to repair trust that’s essentially never been earned — enslaved Africans who were brought to America endured centuries of medical exploitation.

Though the Kaiser monitor summarized Black and Hispanic attitudes as largely hesitant, it did find an inkling of hope: With each monthly accounting of attitudes, more members of each group say they will get the vaccine than say they will not, suggesting that vaccine hesitancy can be reduced with more information. Researchers are confident that communication and clarity about the efficacy and potential side effects of the vaccine can go a long way to change attitudes.

This outlook is already in effect on the ground in Camden, New Jersey, a city that is about 92 percent Black and brown and where one in every 14 residents has been infected with the coronavirus. There, the health department has launched an on-the-ground effort in which a team of ambassadors has been tasked with knocking on as many doors as possible to persuade residents to take the vaccine. According to Camden County health director Paschal Nwako, people’s attitudes about the vaccine have already changed since the team knocked on the first door in November.

“We’ve had individuals who open their door, then close it back on the first day. Then on the next day, they open the door and listen to us for a minute, then close it. Then the next day, they open their door and engage us for five minutes,” Nwako told Vox. “It’s not easy, but we stick with them because we know it’s the only way we can get the community the right information.”

Nwako talked to Vox about the challenges and opportunities ahead with getting Camden residents to take the vaccine. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Camden City has the highest infection rate in the Greater Philadelphia region, with 5,583 cases of coronavirus as of December 11. For comparison, Camden has nearly twice as many cases as the neighboring and largely white Cherry Hill neighborhood, though they have about the same number of residents. Why is this happening in Camden?

Paschal Nwako

In Camden, much of the population lives in multigenerational housing. There is also higher density housing in Camden. There are pockets of essential workers that could have been exposed to the virus in their front-line jobs, like people that work in restaurants and grocery stores. There are also undocumented populations who are worried about reaching out for public health information. So if there are people who live in close quarters, like families that live in one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments, it’s easier for the virus to spread. In Cherry Hill, people are able to spread out. The positivity rate we are seeing comes from people congregating together because they are family-oriented. That’s why around the Thanksgiving holiday, we were telling the community to stay within their own bubbles.

And now, we are seeing more cases in people ages 30 to 42 on average; during the first wave, from March to June, it was people ages 65-plus. But while we are seeing more positive cases in younger people, these people aren’t ending up in the hospital or dying in the same way people died during the first wave.

Fabiola Cineas

The Pfizer vaccine is already in use at Camden’s Cooper University Hospital downtown. What does this mean for the city?

Paschal Nwako

The vaccine is being administered to health care workers at Cooper Hospital during the first phase. They are looking at vaccinating 8,800 employees and expect to take up to a month to do that. Right now, we are in phase 1a, which is health care workers and long-term care residents. From there, we go to phase 1b, which are other essential workers — police officers, firefighters, EMT and EMS workers, people who work in jails, as well as people who work in dental offices, pharmacies, restaurants, supermarkets, and warehouses doing food distribution. These people are essential because without their services like food and health care, we cannot provide what citizens need to survive.

Then we go to phase 1c, which are adults ages 65 and above and all adults with high-risk medical conditions. And then we go into phase 2, which is the general public and should happen sometime in March.

We know that there is vaccine hesitancy, especially among minorities. We have to work hard to make sure that we partner with Camden City residents to disseminate Covid vaccination information in the county, targeting minorities — Hispanics, African Americans, and also faith-based communities in Camden City.

Fabiola Cineas

Studies have shown that Black Americans are among the most hesitant on the vaccine primarily because they’re worried about side effects and also don’t trust the development process. Why is this the case, and have you noticed this kind of reasoning among Camden residents?

Paschal Nwako

Vaccine hesitancy is a barrier among minority populations because of the history in these communities of the testing of medications and vaccines on them in the past. That’s a problem. We are training ambassadors in the community to convince the rest of the community that the vaccine is safe to take.

But while we know there is hesitancy, we expect that to change now that the vaccine is here. People are going to see people like them taking the vaccine. So if we were to give that survey again, we expect the number of people willing to take the vaccine to increase.

And bear in mind that by the time we get this vaccine to the general public in Camden, the number of people that will have taken this vaccine will have increased tremendously. And without side effects between now and then, people will be more willing to take the vaccine. Just like every other product that is new on the market, there will be a hesitancy. People will eventually feel more comfortable to start using it.

Fabiola Cineas

The same Kaiser Family Foundation study revealed that there’s also a fear that there won’t be equitable distribution of the vaccine, that there might not be enough vaccines for certain communities. Is this a fear you’ve come across while on the ground? And what is the county doing to make sure this isn’t a reality?

Paschal Nwako

There’s no such fear here. Everyone will be going through New Jersey’s vaccine scheduling system. It is open to the public, all New Jersey residents, and doesn’t discriminate. Everyone has to sign on and just choose a site. We have ample vaccines that will be coming through from Moderna, and we expect to get more from Pfizer, and also AstraZeneca down the line in March, when they get their emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Fabiola Cineas

Can you say more about the role these vaccine ambassadors are playing in the community? Why did the health department choose to launch this initiative, and what’s the impact been so far?

Paschal Nwako

People are sometimes confused about what they read or hear on the television. So when somebody in their community calls them on the phone, or sends them a text that will end up with a phone call to discuss the vaccines with them, that is more effective.

Since there are high-density living spots in Camden City, if we go into a building and stay in the lobby, we are able to engage people when they come down and get on and off the elevators. We can talk to them briefly there. Then when we get up to the second floor, 10th floor, 12th floor to have more conversations standing 10 feet apart, people are more responsive having seen us in the lobby. That person will be more open to speaking with you than a person who has not seen you before.

That strategy has been working because we are engaging with them by giving them masks, telling them where to go to get tested for coronavirus, and how to social distance.

So far, we have knocked on 52,646 doors, made 57,802 phone calls, sent 37,858 text messages, and conducted 991 wellness check shifts throughout the city.

Fabiola Cineas

Wow! And you’ve also been conducting a vaccine study. What have you been asking residents, and what do you hope the survey can help your team do?

Paschal Nwako

We ask them if they have taken a vaccine before, how they feel about taking vaccines, whether they feel like vaccines can prevent diseases, the side effects they have had in the past when they took a vaccine, and how they feel about the Covid vaccine coming down the pike.

We plan to use the information from this survey for a health education campaign in the community to build trust for the vaccine. We already have health educational materials that we are floating around Camden City. We’re giving it out to the churches that usually send it out to their members or when they come in on Sundays. Information packets are located at the front of churches for people to collect, for example.

Moderna informed us that an African American woman was the lead in producing the Moderna vaccine. So that will help reduce the anxiety and fear in the community over the efficacy of the vaccine.

Fabiola Cineas

What do you think the rest of the country can learn from what your team is doing in Camden around vaccine hesitancy?

Paschal Nwako

We know that it’s better to deal with communities when you are right there with them. If we go door to door, it means that we are right in the community and it means that we are engaging with them right there on the street, in front of their homes. And then we stick with them.

What we are also seeing is that the community needs employment — this is the highest want and need. People don’t want the government to hand them over money. They don’t want them to hand them over food. We have provided them with food, sometimes four times a week with the food bank we provide. They know where to get food. We provide them with masks and all the information they need to get tests and to take the vaccine, and they say, now what? We need a place to go work. Camden was hit with high unemployment as a result of the pandemic. [In April, Camden’s unemployment rate jumped to 15.1 percent from under 5 percent in March 2020; the unemployment rate was 7.1 percent in October, the latest month for which data is available.]

Fabiola Cineas

As we close out a year that has been very tough for Camden residents, what brings you hope as we move into 2021 for administering the vaccine in Camden?

Paschal Nwako

The best hope is that we expect that the end is in sight. But we also know that a vaccine does not equate to vaccinations. Having vaccines but not vaccinating is no good. The good news is, though, that we expect the hesitancy to reduce by March. When the community sees that people are not developing any side effects or dying suddenly because of the vaccine, they will be open to taking it.",voxdotcom,"['black', 'trust', 'residents', 'community', 'health', 'vaccine', 'communities', 'say', 'need', 'latinx', 'city', 'open', 'building', 'camden', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-18 17:10:06+00:00,18,"In the United States, there have been 17 million reported cases of Covid-19 — about 5 percent of the population. Millions more have been infected and either did not get tested or didn’t have symptoms to begin with.

Vaccines are slowly rolling out — first to front-line health care and high-risk people, and next, likely to other essential workers, followed by people ages 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.

But it’s reasonable to ask, given that there are well over 100 million people in these groups and not nearly enough vaccine supply for them right away: Should people who’ve already had Covid-19 be vaccinated too?

After all, the body mounts an immune response to the virus during an infection. In lab studies, scientists find that most people who contract the virus develop neutralizing antibodies to it. These antibodies are the immune system proteins that bind to viruses and render them harmless.

So a person who has had the virus likely has developed some level of immunity. Still, immunologists and vaccine experts say these people can — and perhaps should — get vaccinated anyway, should a vaccine become available to them.

“If I, personally, had Covid, I would still like to be vaccinated,” Alexander Sette, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, says.

He and other immunology and vaccine experts can explain why.

Why people who have had Covid-19 should still be vaccinated

The biggest reason everyone — whether or not they had Covid-19 in the past — should be vaccinated is because different immune systems have responded very differently to the virus.

In general, Sette says, a body will mount a durable immune response. “In fact, we’ve seen it persist up to eight months,” he says. But this is only the case for 90 percent of people. “For 10 percent of people, they don’t seem to have a good immune response eight months out.”

There have been some documented cases of reinfection, which suggests that in some people, the immunity that comes from a first infection is either weak or wanes over time (scientists still don’t know how common reinfection is). Generally, scientists have told us, the worse the first infection, the stronger the immune response will be.

The thing is, “we have no way to tell,” he says, at least easily and feasibly, if a formerly infected person is in the 90 percent or in the 10 percent. Not taking precautions like masking and social distancing, or avoiding a vaccine after an infection, he says, is like “driving a car where you’re 90 percent sure the car has brakes.”

This has been the story of the whole pandemic: The human body’s response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 has been extremely variable. Some people don’t get symptoms at all. Some people end up dying of the infection. “Some develop very high levels of neutralizing antibodies and are likely in no need of vaccines, while others develop undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies,” Yale immunobiology researcher Akiko Iwasaki explains in an email.

So, quite simply: A vaccine helps level out that variability. People whose immune systems didn’t produce a robust response can catch up to those who did. According to Sette, there’s less variability in people’s immune responses to the Covid-19 vaccines than there is to natural infection.

And, again, individuals who have had Covid-19 can’t really gauge their own levels of immunity. Yes, a person could potentially get an antibody test, to see if there are any in their bloodstream.

But the immune system has many, many other components, from memory B cells that can be activated to produce antibodies in the future, to T cells, which kill and destroy infected cells. These are not commonly tested for. And even if an individual could be tested for all the components of an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, it’s still hard to know what it all means for a second infection. Scientists still don’t understand the “correlate of protection” for Covid-19. That is: What is the precise right mix of immune system cells for a particular person that would prevent them from getting infected again?

Sette says it’s a “reasonable argument” to suggest that maybe people who have had Covid-19 shouldn’t be prioritized to get the vaccine, should the stock of it remain limited over the long term. But in practice, that argument could become problematic.

For one: “It’s too difficult to operationalize pre-vaccination testing,” Peter Hotez, vaccine expert and the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, says in an email. It would be tedious work to determine who might be immune to SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination. It could be tedious work to determine who has been infected prior to vaccination as well.

Plus, again, the information resulting from such tests may not be all that useful in determining a person’s lasting immunity.

The vaccines are safe — regardless of whether you have been infected

To sum up: “To be safe, I recommend getting the vaccine, even after you recover from COVID, when the vaccines become sufficiently available,” Iwasaki says.

It’s still a little unclear what the vaccine would add on top of a person’s natural immune response to the infection. Would a person who made a weak immune response to a natural infection make a stronger immune response to a vaccine? It’s possible.

“During a natural exposure to SARS-CoV-2, there are multiple factors that interfere with a robust immune response,” Iwasaki says. “The exposure dose may be too little. The virus interferes with our immune system (both innate and adaptive) to block proper antibody induction.”

On the other hand, she says, “vaccines are formulated to provide just the right dose” of the viral protein, and there’s no live virus to interfere with out immune systems. “There appears to be a much more uniform and higher level of antibodies generated with a vaccine,” she says.

For now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn’t making an official recommendation on whether people who have had Covid-19 should be vaccinated; it’s waiting on the input of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group of medical and public health advisers who make recommendations on how to vaccinate the public. Though we know from clinical trial data, and the Food and Drug Administration’s review of it, that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines appear to be very safe for the general public.

But have they been proven safe, in particular, for people who have already been infected? There may not yet be enough data to say that definitively. “I think the answer is probably yes, but we won’t know for sure until the numbers are larger,” University of Washington immunologist and physician Helen Y. Chu writes in an email. “For most of the phase 3 trials, there was no screening for pre-existing antibody.”

Keep in mind that lack of safety data for this particular group doesn’t mean it’s unsafe. As Chu explained, there just needs to be more data.

Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech trials did include a small number of people who had already been infected, though. On Thursday, Moderna vaccine scientist Jacqueline Miller told an FDA advisory committee that the company is “anticipating data in the coming weeks” on how and whether the company’s vaccine boosts the immune systems of people who had been previously infected.

Also unclear from the current data: whether the vaccine truly does give people who mounted a weak immune response to a natural infection — that is, people who either did not produce a lot of immune system cells to fight the virus or whose immune system cells to fight the virus have declined over time — an immunological boost.

“This is not answered yet, but I would say that it probably does not hurt,” Chu says. “Antibody wanes over time, and it is likely that the vaccine will boost your pre-existing antibody titers.”

That said, per the current trial data, both vaccines are around 95 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. Sette says that high a level of efficacy is probably indicative that the vaccine can produce a robust immune response in a broad majority of people.

The language of vaccine science is really tricky. To say a vaccine protects against disease is not the same as saying the vaccine makes a person completely immune (or unable to spread the virus). Perhaps some people still get infected but clear the infection before symptoms show up. Scientists will need more data on this fine distinction. That said, “it would be hard to fathom that the vaccine gives you a 95 percent protection without inducing an immune response,” Sette says.

There’s a lot about decision-making during the pandemic that’s been very difficult. Deciding whether, and how, to visit friends and loved ones leads to a tedious risk-benefit analysis. Luckily, with the vaccines, this decision matrix is a lot simpler: Even if you have had Covid-19 in the past, a vaccine may help prevent future infections. Yes, more data is needed to be absolutely definitive on this. But for now, this is all pretty encouraging.",voxdotcom,"['response', 'covid19', 'virus', 'vaccine', 'whove', 'infected', 'system', 'vaccines', 'infection', 'yes', 'data', 'benefit', 'immune']",0
2020-12-18 17:00:17+00:00,11,"Congressional leaders are hard at work this week on a stimulus package that could bring much-needed relief to workers, families, and small businesses. It’s not a moment too soon, as many Americans are struggling to get by after months without help from the federal government.

But there’s a crucial piece missing from the negotiations: paid leave.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, passed in March, guaranteed paid sick leave for workers who were quarantined or ill with Covid-19, as well as for those caring for children while schools or day cares were closed. By helping parents keep their jobs while taking time to care for kids, the legislation helped families stay afloat during a nearly impossible time. It also saved lives — one study found that by allowing sick people to stay home and quarantine, the legislation prevented more than 15,000 cases of Covid-19 per day.

But the paid leave benefits in the act expire at the end of 2020 — and so far, they don’t appear to be part of the stimulus deal being negotiated by congressional leaders (neither House Speaker Nancy Pelosi nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has yet responded to Vox’s request for comment). That could force Americans to work while they’re sick, worsening the spread of Covid-19 at a time when the country is already facing its deadliest weeks yet.

It’s “incomprehensible” that members of Congress would fail to extend “literally a lifesaving provision,” Vicki Shabo, senior fellow for paid leave policy and strategy at New America, told Vox. “This is a matter of public health.”

Millions of workers could lose paid leave protections in January

Lack of paid leave has long been a problem for American workers, especially if they make low wages — as of 2017, just 27 percent of those whose pay fell in the bottom 10 percent in the country had access to this benefit. And the problem took on even greater urgency when the pandemic began, since forcing people to work while sick meant they could infect others.

In March, Congress took action by guaranteeing workers 10 days of paid sick leave if they were sick or quarantined because of Covid-19, or were caring for family members who were sick. The legislation also offered an additional 10 weeks of paid leave to parents affected by school or day care closures.

The benefits didn’t apply to everyone — companies with more than 500 employees were exempt, and small businesses and many health care providers could get around the new requirements as well, leaving millions of American workers without protection. And as of this summer, many parents were still unaware of their paid leave options or unwilling to take them, perhaps because of fears of retaliation at work.

Still, the benefits made a difference. According to a study published in October, granting paid sick leave to even some workers prevented about 400 cases of Covid-19 per state per day, or over 15,000 across the country. They also helped Americans take time off to care for children or family members, without the risk of losing a paycheck or even their job. They were especially crucial for low-income people who can’t afford to take unpaid time, Shabo noted, and for women, who have disproportionately shouldered the added caregiving responsibilities of the Covid-19 crisis.

But now the paid leave benefits in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act are due to expire. And unlike expanded unemployment insurance and aid to small businesses, they weren’t part of the $908 billion bipartisan deal that served as a starting point for the current round of talks in Congress.

Without paid leave, many families could be stranded in the new year, with the virus causing record deaths and hospitalizations and many schools still on remote or hybrid schedules. “We’re now at the point where parents who took the paid leave that they had to care for kids are running out of it,” Shabo said, “and yet we’re going to be in the situation that we’re in for many more months.”

Many Americans can’t afford to take unpaid time off, whether it’s to care for children or quarantine after a positive Covid-19 test. Research conducted before the pandemic showed that “just three unpaid days away from work jeopardized a family’s ability to buy food for the entire month,” Shabo said, and about seven days jeopardized the ability to pay rent or a mortgage.

And a failure to extend paid leave protections would further hamper the country’s ability to fight the coronavirus at a time when thousands of Americans are dying every single day.

Paid leave benefits aren’t expensive when compared to other parts of the relief package — extending them would cost about $1.8 billion, or less than 0.2 percent of the total price tag, according to New America. It’s not clear why they haven’t been included in negotiations thus far, though some Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have opposed the paid leave expansion from the beginning. Corporate interests have historically sought to block mandated paid leave on the grounds that it hinders businesses’ flexibility, as the American Prospect reported in March, and Republicans have often sided with them.

Advocates on the issue are continuing to urge members of Congress to include paid leave in the current package, Shabo said. Negotiations continue on Friday and could extend into the weekend.

If they don’t include it this time around, Congress could take up the issue again in the next recovery package in 2021. But it’s unclear when that will happen. In the meantime, American workers would be left without support as they navigate an ongoing pandemic and caregiving crisis.

Ultimately, the eleventh-hour debate illustrates a larger problem that many have pointed to since the pandemic began: American workers lack many of the protections that workers in other countries have, leaving them and the entire country ill-equipped to handle any kind of crisis. “If we had had a national paid leave policy and a national paid sick day standard in place in the first place, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” Shabo said.",voxdotcom,"['americans', 'emergency', 'covid19', 'benefits', 'sick', 'millions', 'workers', 'care', 'lose', 'shabo', 'leave', 'pandemic', 'families', 'paid']",0

2020-12-17 22:08:19+00:00,10,"An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted on Thursday 20-to-0, with one abstention, to recommend the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine for an emergency use authorization for people ages 18 and older, determining that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. This makes the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine the second one to receive a green light from the committee.

The FDA is expected to accept the recommendation from the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee within days, at which time the vaccine, which has an efficacy of almost 95 percent, can begin being distributed to health workers and high-risk populations.

“We’re in an unparalleled crisis, and I did not think an EUA was the way to go, but since the train has left the station, I appreciate that Moderna has given us a very transparent and thorough study that even from the beginning seemed very well organized,” said A. Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology at the University of Michigan and a temporary voting member of the committee, explaining her vote in favor.

The vote in favor of the Moderna vaccine comes a week after a similar approval for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which also uses an mRNA platform to generate immunity and is administered as two doses spaced several weeks apart. That vaccine has begun deliveries in the United States this week across all 50 states.

Operation Warp Speed, the $10 billion program from the Department of Health and Human Services aimed at accelerating Covid-19 vaccine development, is expecting to have 12.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine ready to dispense before the end of the month. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a press conference Wednesday that the program has purchased 100 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 100 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be delivered by the end of March.

Unlike Pfizer, Moderna received direct support from the US government for its research and development, totaling $4.1 billion for clinical trials and manufacturing. Moderna’s vaccine also has less strict cold storage requirements. It demands long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2° and 8°C (36° to 46°F). Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, on the other hand, requires temperatures of minus 70°C (minus 94°F) or lower.

An emergency use authorization for the Moderna vaccine would give the company the green light to increase manufacturing to deliver protection from Covid-19 to more Americans. But as with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there will not be enough doses to go around right away, so health officials will have to make tricky decisions about who gets the shots first.

And an EUA is still a step short of full approval, which means there remain some critical questions about the vaccine that need to be addressed with further clinical trials.

What we learned recently about the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine

The public received details about the Moderna vaccine for the first time outside of the company’s press releases in a briefing document published by the FDA on Tuesday.

Looking at 30,351 participants in their phase 3 clinical trial, Moderna’s latest results showed its vaccine had an efficacy of 94.1 percent against confirmed Covid-19 illness that produced symptoms. The study detected 185 Covid-19 cases in the placebo group and 11 cases in the group that received the vaccine.

The vaccine is administered as two doses spaced 28 days apart. However, it seems to begin to offer protection against Covid-19 shortly after the first dose, with protection continuing to build after the second.

In a presentation to the FDA vaccine committee, Moderna also highlighted that its vaccine not only prevents disease but also seems to prevent infection, including infections that don’t generate any symptoms.

“There were approximately 2/3 fewer swabs that were positive in the vaccine group as compared to the placebo group at the pre-dose 2 timepoint, suggesting that some asymptomatic infections start to be prevented after the first dose,” according to Moderna’s briefing.

This is hugely valuable for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. The virus has shown an ability to spread between people before the infected show any symptoms, and some of the infected can be completely asymptomatic. That means people can unwittingly spread the virus. But with a vaccine that lowers asymptomatic infections in addition to disease, the spread of Covid-19 can be more easily controlled.

Really important about Moderna vaccine



After 1 dose, it reduces asymptomatic infections by about 67%



We don't know what happens after 2nd dose (yet) but as I have been saying, these vaccines likely reduce spread of asymptomatic disease



Now some evidence that is true https://t.co/6TcfT9w09m — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) December 15, 2020

However, the results this week also shed some light on the side effects of the Moderna vaccine. In the phase 3 trial, about 16 percent of people in the vaccine group had a severe adverse reaction, defined by the FDA as a reaction that requires medical attention and prevents people going about their daily lives.

“The most common solicited adverse reactions associated with mRNA-1273 [Moderna vaccine] were injection site pain (91.6%), fatigue (68.5%), headache (63.0%), muscle pain (59.6%), joint pain (44.8%), and chills (43.4%); severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.2% to 9.7% of participants, were more frequent after dose 2 than after dose 1, and were generally less frequent in participants ≥65 years of age as compared to younger participants,” according to Moderna’s briefing to the FDA.

The briefing also acknowledged that there are many critical questions that remain unresolved. One is how long the protection from the vaccine will last, something that will require continued monitoring of the participants in the clinical trial and potential recipients under an EUA.

There is also limited information about how well the vaccine works in people with compromised immune systems and pregnant people. There is no information about the efficacy of the vaccine in people under the age of 18 since they were excluded from the clinical trials. It’s also not clear how well the vaccine blocks transmission relative to other measures like wearing face masks and social distancing.

Moderna has committed to monitoring its trial pool for two years and will conduct additional studies among the people who receive the vaccine under an EUA in order to get answers to these questions.

In the meantime, the FDA will consider the recommendation from its advisers. The FDA granted an EUA to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine just over a day after it received a vote of confidence from the vaccine advisory committee, so an authorization for the Moderna vaccine could come as soon as Friday.",voxdotcom,"['dose', 'advisers', 'participants', 'group', 'moderna', 'emergency', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'recommended', 'committee', 'fda', 'second', 'clinical', 'doses']",0
2020-12-17 19:37:54+00:00,4,"The biotech firm Moderna announced Monday that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, was shown to be 94.5 percent effective in protecting volunteers in a clinical trial against the disease.

“This is a pivotal moment in the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” said Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, in a statement. “This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease.”

It’s more good news following Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement of positive results from their Covid-19 vaccine candidate trial a week ago. But unlike Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna offered far more information about the recipients of the vaccine, showing its efficacy across different ages and ethnic groups. And its results offer a brighter ray of hope for rolling out a vaccine in 2021 as the United States faces its worst stretch of the pandemic yet, with record numbers of new cases and hospitalizations.

The announcements also mean that the world will likely have more than one highly effective vaccine for Covid-19, and the end of the pandemic could be on the horizon. High efficacy also means that fewer people would need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, the threshold at which the virus can no longer spread easily from person to person.

Very exciting to see 94% efficacy of @moderna_tx #SARSCoV2 vaccine at interim analysis of 95 events. This replication of Pfizer's high efficacy tells us the virus is eminently vaccinatable. https://t.co/YpxQdkyUjF — Eric Topol (@EricTopol) November 16, 2020

However, there are some caveats: The results are preliminary, the vaccine requires two doses, there are some side effects, the clinical trial isn’t complete, and the findings were announced in a press release instead of a peer-reviewed paper. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.

And while demonstrating high efficacy is important, the road to getting millions of people vaccinated is fraught with logistical challenges. While this is an important result, a lot of difficult work on a Covid-19 vaccine still lies ahead.

How Moderna showed that its Covid-19 vaccine works

Moderna’s announcement of almost 95 percent efficacy is based on a phase 3 clinical trial. In particular, the results are from the COVE study, conducted in collaboration with the US government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

Phase 3 is where the vaccine is tested against the virus spreading in the real world. Since experimenters can’t deliberately infect people, they have to wait and see who gets sick with Covid-19 in their volunteer pool, comparing the group that received the actual vaccine to the group that received the placebo. Moderna’s vaccine is administered as two doses spaced four weeks apart.

To speed up the process, researchers recruit thousands of volunteers so that the rate of accumulating infections goes up. But it only takes a handful of infections to demonstrate that the vaccine works.

Of course, I'll start with the topline result of 94.5% efficacy (90 placebo cases, 5 vaccinated cases). For a high efficacy vaccine, 95 cases is a lot of data. In event-driven trials, the number of cases matters more than the number of participants. 2/10https://t.co/fTEB6homTT — Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) November 16, 2020

“If the vaccine doesn’t work at all, and 50 percent of people are in the vaccine group, 50 percent in the placebo group, we expect cases to be evenly split across the groups,” explained Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, in an email. “When the vaccine is working, we observe fewer cases in the vaccine group.”

According to Moderna, experimenters detected 95 Covid-19 cases, of which 90 cases were in the placebo group compared to five cases in the group that received the actual vaccine. The results show that the virus was spreading among volunteers in the clinical trial but it was drastically lower among those who received Moderna’s vaccine.

Why Moderna’s results, while preliminary, are still important and exciting

There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure that vaccine manufacturers are not gaming the results.

In a clinical trial like this, neither the company nor the volunteers know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. This is known as a double-blind study and is considered the gold standard for clinical research. It’s done to prevent either side from changing their behavior or biasing the trial in a deliberate or unconscious way. Someone who knows they received the actual vaccine may engage in riskier behavior, for example, or the company may be tempted to give the vaccine to people already at lower risk of exposure to boost the apparent efficacy.

Instead, there’s a group of independent scientists known as the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that serves as an intermediary between the volunteers and the experimenters. The DSMB knows who received what among the volunteers but doesn’t disclose that to the company right away. Instead, the members monitor the trial pool to ensure there are no severe complications and can stop the trial if there are any problems.

The DSMB then convenes with the company and experimenters at predetermined checkpoints, namely when a certain number of infections are detected. The recent vaccine announcements from Moderna and from Pfizer and BioNTech both emerged from such a preliminary meeting, both at roughly the 95 infection checkpoint. While these results are not peer-reviewed per se, implicit in these announcements is that a group of independent scientists have verified these results. That’s why many scientists who have been paying attention to these clinical trials are so excited about the findings, even though they are preliminary.

“The vaccine is on its way, folks, so hang in there, hang tough,” Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, said last week in response to the Pfizer and BioNTech announcement. “We’re going to get over this together.”

Moderna expects the final analysis of its clinical trial to be conducted when 151 Covid-19 infections are confirmed in the trial pool. It’s hard to say when it will get that many cases, but given the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 in the United States, it’s likely to happen within the next two months.

There are some caveats to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine results

Moderna’s results were announced in a press release — like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine results, Moderna’s announcement came directly from the company itself. There have been several peer-reviewed interim studies about its mRNA-1273 vaccine, but Monday’s efficacy announcement didn’t come with any published data.

Caution: this is a press release not a scientific paper. Looking forward to more detailed efficacy and safety data e.g. https://t.co/DQctLPM0li — Saad B. Omer (@SaadOmer3) November 16, 2020

That doesn’t mean the results are wrong, but they are only a snapshot in time, and without more details, it’s hard to unpack critical nuances needed to interpret them, like what kinds of underlying health conditions influence the efficacy of a vaccine.

These for-profit companies also have a financial incentive to play up good news and smooth over any bumps on the road to an approved vaccine. As the trial proceeds, the results could be reinforced or undermined.

“When we do finally have a viable Covid-19 immunization, the public needs to be able to trust that it’s safe and effective,” wrote Vox’s Julia Belluz. “And the road to building that confidence isn’t paved with preliminary, sparsely detailed news releases that are later overturned when the real work of vetting the vaccines is done.”

But as mentioned above, the fact that these results have independent validation gives them more weight. So there is cause for optimism and skepticism.

Moderna revealed some of the demographics of who is in its trial pool, but more information is still needed; it’s unlikely that a vaccine will be equally effective in all groups of people, so it’s important to pay close attention to the demographics of who gets sick and who gets protected in a vaccine trial.

According to Moderna, the 95 Covid-19 cases were detected in 15 adults over the age of 65 and 20 participants identifying as having a minority background, including 12 Hispanic or Latinx people, four Black or African American people, three Asian American people, and one multiracial person. This shows that the trial recruited a broad spectrum of participants.

This is immensely valuable information for public health and can help guide a vaccination strategy. But health officials still need more information about things like preexisting conditions in the trial pool and the amount of exposure to the virus people experienced.

There are some side effects — Moderna said volunteers generally tolerated their vaccine pretty well, and most problems tended to be mild to moderate.

Nice safety profile, and participants will continue to be followed. Remember - evaluation of vaccine safety never stops, even after vaccines are approved and deployed. We have an adverse event reporting system to continually monitor all vaccines. 7/10 pic.twitter.com/ynGsXjArei — Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) November 16, 2020

Reported problems included injection site pain (2.7 percent) after the first dose, and after the second dose, recipients reported fatigue (9.7 percent), muscle pain (8.9 percent), arthralgia (5.2 percent), headache (4.5 percent), pain (4.1 percent) and redness at the injection site (2 percent), with some overlap in these numbers among patients who experienced more than one effect. Most of these effects were short-lived. A final safety evaluation will still be needed once the trial is run to completion.

While these effects are fairly mild, it’s important to pay close attention to them since vaccines will ultimately have to be distributed to millions, if not billions, of people. Rare complications will be more likely to show up once lots of people get the shot. And clinical trials of other Covid-19 vaccine candidates —like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine — have already been paused due to complications among recipients. For vaccinations, safety is paramount.

The Moderna vaccine has other important advantages

Monday’s vaccine efficacy announcement also illustrated some critical lessons about how Moderna was able to achieve these results and other details that could influence a vaccination strategy.

RNA is a viable way to make a vaccine: Moderna’s vaccine is now the second RNA-based vaccine that has demonstrated a high efficacy against Covid-19. Using RNA genetic material — in this case a variant known as mRNA — is a new vaccine technology. Such an approach has never received approval for widespread use, so these results are an important validation. The way it works is that the instructions for making a piece of the virus are inserted into the body. After cells read the instructions and manufacture the component of the virus, the immune system detects it and starts to mount a response.

This is a huge shift from conventional vaccines, which typically use a weakened version of the live virus, a whole dead virus, or a fragment of the virus. With RNA and similar DNA-based vaccines, there is no viral structure injected.

Like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, Moderna’s RNA-based vaccine also codes for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The spike is the part of the virus that lets it enter cells and take them over, and teaching the immune system to target this component has now been demonstrated to be a viable strategy.

Moderna’s vaccine appears to protect against mild and severe Covid-19: Efficacy in this context is defined as the share of vaccinated people who actually receive protection against the disease in question. For Covid-19, Food and Drug Administration guidelines say that a vaccine needs to provide protection against the coronavirus for at least 50 percent of the people who get it. That means at least half of the people who get the vaccine have to have some form of protection.

At 94.5 percent efficacy, Moderna’s results vault over this benchmark. But the company went a step further, reporting that out of the 11 severe Covid-19 cases it identified in its trial pool, all were in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group.

What this shows is that the vaccine is effective against severe manifestations of the illness. It may be the case that someone who gets vaccinated could still get a mild infection, but it’s likely the vaccine will keep them out of the hospital. While 11 is a small number of cases, it’s unlikely to have occurred by chance.

One lingering concern is that Moderna hasn’t disclosed how long this protection will last, and it may not be able to find out without simply waiting and seeing. Figuring out the duration of protection from a vaccine will likely require long-term monitoring.

Government support played a crucial role: Just about every vaccine candidate has benefited from the government’s efforts to speed up trials. The FDA allowed experimenters to run phases of clinical trials concurrently and accelerated many of their regulatory approval processes. The US government has also committed to buy millions of doses of a vaccine from whichever manufacturer crosses the line under Operation Warp Speed, a US government initiative aimed at procuring 300 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by January 2021.

That’s a big reason a Covid-19 vaccine may be on the market in record time, likely within two years instead of the typical decades-long development that vaccines usually require.

Moderna also received a direct boost under Operation Warp Speed. The Department of Health and Human Services awarded the company $483 million in April, followed by $472 million in July to support clinical trials. Then in August, HHS announced $1.5 billion in manufacturing support for Moderna’s vaccine.

It’s easier to keep Moderna’s vaccine cool than the one from Pfizer and BioNTech: Moderna was quick to highlight that its vaccine candidate has much lighter logistical requirements and can be stored at warmer temperatures than the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.

Moderna’s vaccine requires long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s well within the temperature range of conventional refrigerators. Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, however, demands temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, which requires ultra-cold freezers and careful shipping.

That means the logistics of getting Moderna’s vaccine to people are much easier.

However, Moderna’s vaccine, like Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidates, is still a two-dose vaccine, which means every recipient will have to come back after several weeks for a second injection. And that means vaccinations will require twice the number of doses as a single-dose vaccine, adding to the cost of the effort.

What happens next for a Covid-19 vaccine

There are still several key steps between the results as they were announced, completing a trial, getting approval, and getting it to everyone that needs it.

The trial still has to run to completion, and both vaccine candidates — from Moderna and from Pfizer and BioNTech — need more safety data before they can seek full approval. However, they may be able to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. That would allow the vaccine to be used in limited cases for people facing some of the highest exposures to Covid-19, like health workers and workers in essential roles.

“Moderna intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with U.S. FDA in the coming weeks and expects the EUA to be based on the final analysis of 151 cases and a median follow-up of more than 2 months,” according to Moderna’s press release.

Related A vaccine may not be enough to end the pandemic

Once a vaccine gets approved, a global supply chain, from the glass vials that hold the vaccine to the syringes used to inject them, needs to spool up to make huge quantities of the vaccine. Manufacturers will also have to ensure that vaccines remain intact and under strict temperature controls from the factory to the hospitals and clinics where they will be used. The process of manufacturing, distributing, and administering a vaccine could take months.

And vaccine research doesn’t end once a vaccine gets approved. Researchers and companies will still have to track complications across millions of people and pay attention to how quickly immunity wanes.

It’s also important to remember that a vaccine is not enough on its own to end the pandemic. Measures like social distancing, good hygiene, and wearing face masks will remain essential to control the spread of Covid-19 until a vaccine is widely available. Public acceptance will also be a major issue, and health officials will have to overcome a rising wave of vaccine hesitancy.

A vaccine on its own will not end the #COVID19 pandemic. We will still need to continue:

-Testing, isolating & caring for cases

-Tracing & quarantining contacts

While the end of the pandemic is now coming into focus with the latest vaccine announcements, a lot of hard work is still needed, and some of the toughest days of the Covid-19 pandemic lie ahead.

2020-12-17 18:30:07+00:00,32,"After months of waiting, we finally have detailed information on the safety and efficacy of the first Covid-19 vaccines that will be distributed in America.

On Thursday, a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration voted to recommend the Moderna vaccine for an emergency use authorization for people ages 18 and over. Ahead of the decision, the agency shared the most comprehensive data to date on what we know about the shot. The same process happened last week with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is now being rolled out across America following an EUA Friday night.

While both vaccines had already been shown to be highly effective, the new data provides a much more granular picture of their side effects and safety profiles.

What’s now clear: An injection with either vaccine, both of which use mRNA technology, can feel more intense than other routine vaccinations (such as the flu shot) — with side effects for some recipients such as pain, headache, and fatigue. And this may be especially true for Moderna’s vaccine: About 16 percent of people who got the shot in clinical trials experienced a “severe” systemic adverse reaction, a classification the FDA uses to refer to side effects, like fever or fatigue, that require medical attention and prevent people from going about their daily activities.

“We should anticipate that if you got vaccinated that day, you may not want to go to work,” Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, said of the vaccines. That’s why health systems are being warned to stagger immunizing their workforces, to avoid “potential clustering of worker absenteeism,” as the vaccine expert group advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put it.

These side effects are known as reactogenicity, and vaccine developers and regulators allow for some level of reactogenicity in all approved vaccines. They can be a sign of the body’s immune response kicking into gear, said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.

I think it will be very important to communicate to the population that these vaccines have more reactogenicity (injection site pain, transient fatigue, headache, elev temp) than most other licensed vaccines. Not dangerous but unpleasant. People need to know what to expect. https://t.co/51R1J8vRKQ — Florian Krammer (@florian_krammer) December 2, 2020

“Think about [reactogenicity] as mouthwash — it’s hurting while it’s working,” Omer said. “The key is to prepare people to know this will happen — this may hurt a little, give you a bit of fever — but these are short-term, known side effects that you need to be aware of.”

The stakes for clearly communicating information about each vaccine’s risks and benefits are high: More than a quarter of Americans reported that they would probably or definitely refuse to take a Covid-19 vaccine, according to a late-summer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, even if it were freely available and deemed safe by regulators. And with the virus spreading farther and faster in America than just about anywhere else in the world, it’s critical that people don’t feel caught off guard by the side effects or spread misinformation about the vaccine.

To achieve that, transparency is key, said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth professor of political science who has been thinking about how to build confidence in the Covid-19 vaccines. “Millions of people are going to get this vaccine, and we know huge numbers of people are going to have normal side effects, which are often indicating that the vaccine is working. We want to build trust with people so there are no surprises when that happens.”

In that spirit, here’s what we know about the side effects of these two shots and how to think about them.

What mild and moderate side effects really mean

Before we get into the weeds, it’s helpful to understand how these companies classify side effects in the first place. In general, vaccine developers seeking approval in the US market use the FDA’s “toxicity assessment scale” to grade side effects and other adverse events from 1 to 4, from mild and moderate to severe and life-threatening.

Grade 1 “mild” side effects are generally easily tolerated and don’t interfere with a person’s regular activities. Grade 2 “moderate” effects may interfere with regular activities, grade 3 “severe” effects are incapacitating and need medical attention, and grade 4 are “potentially life-threatening,” usually requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization. Let’s use the example of headache following vaccination. Here’s how the FDA would classify it:

Mild: “No interference with activity”

Moderate: “Repeated use of nonnarcotic pain reliever > 24 hours or some interference with activity”

Severe: “Any use of narcotic pain reliever or prevents daily activity”

Potentially life-threatening: “ER visit or hospitalization”

So a mild side effect is one you’d notice but doesn’t require any special care or keep you from living your life; a moderate side effect can keep you home from work but doesn’t warrant medical intervention; severe adverse events require medical care and definitely interfere with your normal life; and potentially life-threatening is just what it sounds like and usually involves a visit to or stay in the hospital.

In vaccine studies, these events are broken down into “local” reactions (meaning they’re specific to one part of the body, like pain or tenderness where the vaccine is injected) and “systemic,” whole-body reactions (like fever or fatigue).

For a vaccine to win FDA approval, any reactions people have during clinical trials have to be mostly mild and moderate. And that’s because the safety bar for vaccines is really high, even compared to medicines.

Vaccines “are given to healthy people who have in many cases absolutely nothing wrong with them. And we are talking about [giving them] to literally billions of people. Even rare side effects if they’re serious matter enormously,” said Charles Weijer, a professor of medicine and an ethicist at Western University in Canada. “We’re more willing to accept adverse effects [with drugs], provided those are counterbalanced by benefits to the patient.”

Mostly mild and moderate side effects are the safety profiles of both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines — and that’s why the FDA in the US and drug regulators in other countries around the world are rushing to bring them to market. But there are important differences between the two vaccines.

What we know about Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech side effects

Now let’s look at the best data we’ve got on the vaccines. It comes from the FDA’s analyses of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials ahead of their emergency use authorization meetings on December 10 for Pfizer/BioNTech and December 17 for Moderna. (The companies also released their own data for the meeting, but we focused on the agency’s independent reviews here.)

The reviews show the vaccines are both safe and that they’re extremely good at preventing Covid-19 infections (with around a 95 percent efficacy rate). That’s hugely important at a time when more than 3,000 Americans are dying from Covid-19 each day on average.

They also give a sense of what side effects we might expect when these vaccines are rolled out. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine caused mild or moderate reactions in most people, and severe reactions were rare. Moderna didn’t share the details of its vaccine trial’s mild and moderate side effects, but the FDA said mild and moderate is how they’d characterize the bulk of them. A key difference with the Moderna vaccine, however, is that we know severe reactions were more common in the trials.

Let’s get into what this means, but with a couple of caveats first. Because we have no head-to-head study of the two vaccines and the companies haven’t reported side effect data in the same way, doing apples-to-apples comparisons is tricky, said Hilda Bastian, an expert in reading medical evidence who has been analyzing the coronavirus vaccine data. The vaccines also come in different doses: 30µg in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech and 100µg with Moderna. While they’re supposed to be delivered in two shots per person, the time intervals are different: The Pfizer/BioNTech shots are three weeks apart, and Moderna’s are four weeks.

Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna also tested their products on different populations. “Some of the differences affect risks and so could be affecting outcomes,” said Bastian. For example, there were more people of Hispanic/Latino background and with chronic lung disease in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial than the Moderna trial, she added. And in the real world, when the vaccines roll out to millions, the side effects may again look different.

With all that in mind, here’s what we know about each shot. For Pfizer/BioNTech the most common side effects overall, according to the FDA’s analysis of the data, were local reactions at the site of injection (including pain, redness, swelling), fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Again, these were mostly classified as mild or moderate. Severe reactions, meanwhile, were rare — occurring in 0 to 4.6 percent of participants, depending on the specific side effect.

In general, side effects popped up more after the second dose than the first. They also happened less frequently in people 55 and younger, the FDA said. You can see the breakdown of adverse events data in younger adults (18-55) in the chart below following dose 1 and, if you click through, following dose 2. (Note: Pfizer/BioNTech found no potentially life-threatening (grade 4) adverse reactions linked to the vaccine in the population they analyzed for safety.)

Now let’s look at the FDA’s Moderna data. Again, the company didn’t share the details of their mild and moderate adverse events — and revealed fewer details than Pfizer/BioNTech generally. But we know the most common reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, and chills.

Though the FDA said these were mostly mild and moderate, we only have the specific figures for total events and the more severe reactions. For example, 83 percent of study participants experienced a systemic adverse reaction of any level of severity while 15.7 percent experienced a severe “systemic” adverse reaction and 7 percent, a severe “local” reaction. Depending on the type, these severe events ranged in frequency from 0.2 to 9.7 percent.

Like the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, side effects were more frequent after the second dose and less common overall in adults 65 and older. Side effects that required hospitalization or emergency room visit were extremely rare. According to FDA analysis, “Across groups and doses, <0.1% reported a Grade 4 systemic reaction.” You can see that below, in a chart focusing on safety data in the younger adults in the study.

So what can we take away from all this?

“We know neither of these vaccines carries a high risk of serious adverse events. And we can expect them to cause typical reactions to vaccines,” said Bastian. But there are important differences. At least in these trials, all side effects and especially severe side effects were more common with the Moderna vaccine.

“The overall picture is that almost everyone has systemic adverse events with Moderna’s vaccine, and we don’t know how often they were only mild,” Bastian said. “For Pfizer/BioNTech, most people had at least mild reactions, but moderate reactions were common too.” So, at least for now, it seems reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine “are considerably less severe.”

The vaccines “are on the fairly reactive side compared to most vaccines we commonly use,” said Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University and a former FDA chief scientist. “It’s hard to compare between the two, but you do get the feeling these systemic reactions like muscle and joint aches are maybe more common in the Moderna vaccine than Pfizer.” Goodman also noted that rates of adverse reactions in Moderna’s placebo groups were higher, and side effects were generally less severe in people who had already been infected with Covid-19.

For the general population, though, there isn’t anything to fear with either vaccine. Again, side effects, if they do pop up, will be mostly moderate or mild. And this doesn’t come as a surprise to vaccine researchers. “The side effects [we’re seeing] are symptoms associated with products of the immune system — cytokines — that are recruited when fighting an infection or responding to a vaccine,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “That’s why people over 65 have a lesser rate of these side effects than younger people — just evidence of a more senescent immune system.”

There’s still a lot to learn about these vaccines

Even with all the available data, there are still unknowns about the two vaccines. We may not see additional rare side effects or severe reactions that will emerge until millions of people get them, for example.

Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, showed up in three people who got the Moderna vaccine and four people who got the Pfizer/BioNTech shot in the companies’ late-stage trials. It’s not yet clear whether these cases are actually linked with the vaccines — since Bell’s palsy can occur in the general population irrespective of vaccination — but because “we see a similar imbalance in two different studies, it pricks my ears up a bit,” Goodman said, and it’s something we’ll learn more about as the vaccines are rolled out.

There are also groups the vaccines weren’t tested in, like pregnant women and people with HIV. In the cases of anaphylaxis in the UK following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, two people with a history of severe allergies — the kind that force them to carry around EpiPen-type devices — had a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, were treated, and recovered. Allergic reactions were very rare in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial (affecting only 0.63 of people who got the vaccine, according to the FDA’s analysis). And people with severe allergies were also excluded from the study.

Clinical trials are not the real world of people; they all have inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Like no history of anaphylaxis (protocol ).

The CDC is now advising that people with a history of severe allergic reactions to vaccines can still get the Pfizer/BioNTech shot but should be counseled about the risks and be monitored for 30 minutes afterward, while those with an allergy to a specific vaccine ingredient shouldn’t get the shot.

Long-term Covid-19 vaccine side effects are “not really a thing”

But, again, there’s some reassurance to be taken here: Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are extremely rare generally. Most serious vaccine reactions — such as the rare neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome — tend to happen within six weeks of getting immunized, said Colleen Kelley, associate professor of medicine at Emory University, who is also a principal investigator in the Moderna trial. And we already have more than six weeks of data on safety and side effects in the two shots.

“People worry about late or long-term side effects occurring a year or two later — that’s not really a thing with vaccination,” Kelley said.

Instead of taking a large dose of medication for many years, where a side effect may surface only after lots of exposure, with vaccines, Bastian said, you’re getting a small dose to stimulate an immune reaction once or a few times. So it makes sense that the longer-term risks aren’t a major problem.

Again, though, this doesn’t mean all coronavirus vaccines are entirely safe or that there’s not more to learn about these two. And as other Covid-19 vaccines hit the market, clarity and transparency about what we know will be paramount if we want people to trust and take the vaccines, Bastian said. “The evidence says treat people like adults. Tell people the truth. Anything else is manipulation and that’s a form of lying.”

2020-12-17 18:00:14+00:00,10,"When asked about the need to prioritize Covid-19 relief versus reining in America’s national debt, there’s no contest: People are a lot more focused on relief right now, according to a new poll from Vox and Data for Progress.

Seventy-four percent of likely voters surveyed December 11 to 13 say that passing new coronavirus relief is more important than getting the national debt under control, while 21 percent say the opposite. Even among Republicans, 65 percent of those polled said relief was more important than concerns about the national debt, while 31 percent disagreed.

These results bolster Democrats’ longstanding arguments for a more expansive stimulus proposal, which Republicans had previously rejected largely due to worries about the national debt. “There is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars. The answer to these challenges will not simply be shoveling cash out of Washington, the answer to these challenges will be getting people back to work,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) emphasized this July.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said, too, that a smaller, narrower bill would be more palatable to his members. Republicans’ unwillingness to consider a more generous stimulus package has successfully forced a limited approach: While House Democrats’ latest version of the HEROES Act would have included $2.2 trillion in aid, a stimulus agreement struck this week will likely contain about $900 billion.

And in the long term, the survey hinted that Republican voters are ready to back a calculated return to fiscal conservatism now that Democrats will once again control the White House. But at least here and now, people favor more spending in both the abstract and the specific. Two-thirds of the likely voters in this survey favored a large relief package that includes $1,200 stimulus checks, while 27 percent back a more targeted option. This poll was conducted with 1,136 likely voters and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.

Respondents were also open to adds to the national debt if it were an investment in growth. Seventy percent of people agree that the federal government should occasionally take on debt that drives economic growth, much like households take on debt to pay for a new home or investments in education, and 51 percent say that taking on more debt in the short term is acceptable if it’s helping fuel economic growth.

As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in December regarding more stimulus, “The risk of overdoing it is less than the risk of underdoing it.”

There are some likely voters — particularly Republicans — who’d like to see Biden focus on the national debt

As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in the new year — and Senate Republicans plan to resume their posture as deficit hawks — there are a plurality of likely voters who’d like to see Biden focus on curbing additions to the debt.

Forty-five percent of likely voters emphasize that limiting these additions should be a top priority for the Biden administration as it weighs different plans, a sentiment that 58 percent of Republicans, 42 percent of independents, and 33 percent of Democrats share. Forty percent of likely voters, however, think it should be a lower priority, and 15 percent don’t know. Similarly, 46 percent of likely voters would support Congress putting pressure on the Biden administration regarding spending that adds to the national debt, while 43 percent would oppose congressional efforts to do so, and 12 percent don’t know.

And although a majority of likely voters said that limiting the national debt was important to them, just 15 percent of people said it was the No. 1 thing they’d want lawmakers to focus on in the new term.

Republican lawmakers, including Cruz, have signaled that they’re interested in dialing up their focus on fiscal conservatism now that Democrats have won back the White House — even if such actions are contradictory to stances they’ve taken during the Trump administration. (Trump’s 2017 tax cuts are estimated to add between $1 trillion and $2 trillion to the national debt, according to the Tax Policy Center.)

2020-12-17 15:20:06+00:00,23,"There are around 1,000 mountain gorillas left in the wild, and about 460 of them live in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. In the park’s very dense, high-altitude forest (hence the name “impenetrable”), veterinarian Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka is working to keep them alive through the Covid-19 pandemic.

No gorilla has come down with Covid-19, but Kalema-Zikusoka fears what might happen if one did. Gorillas live in tight-knit groups, so a respiratory infection could easily spread among them. Infected gorillas could get sick and die, or possibly suffer long-term consequences from the disease.

Kalema-Zikusoka founded the nonprofit Conservation Through Public Health, where she works with the local community, and the park, to keep the gorillas healthy, and create a tourism economy that’s sustainable for both the gorillas and the people who live near them.

“This virus is a threat to the gorillas,” she said on a recent Zoom call from Entebbe, Uganda, where she lives. “Before, we never used to have to wear a mask when you visit the gorillas, but now you have to.” Also new: Visitors must stay 32 feet (10 meters) away from the animals, up from 23 feet (7 meters) before the pandemic. Visitors now also get their temperatures checked upon arrival.

Kalema-Zikusoka told me about other precautions in place to protect the animals — what she’d do if one got sick, and how to quarantine these 300-plus-pound animals should they be exposed. She also described the intense and competing challenges conservation groups like hers face to keep the animals safe these days: When tourism dropped due to the pandemic, poaching increased. But when tourism resumed this fall, the threat of spreading disease to the gorillas increased.

“Tourism is a good thing, but it has to be done in a responsible way so that it doesn’t end up wiping out the very species,” she says. “It’s a very delicate balance.”

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

A gorilla can’t social distance

Brian Resnick

The gorillas in Bwindi — do they often come close to humans?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Yes. There’s about 459 gorillas in the park, and about 200 are habituated for tourism and research.

Brian Resnick

What does habituated mean? They will let people approach them?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Habituated generally means ... you can get as close as 5, 7 meters to them. It means they won’t run away when they see a human being.

Brian Resnick

Do the gorillas come in close enough contact with people that you have to worry about respiratory diseases like Covid-19?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Yes, we definitely do worry about it.

There have always been strict guidelines [for humans to stay 23 feet away from them]. But some of the gorillas, which are so used to people, can get even closer. So actually, that’s why we thought that during the pandemic we really needed to reduce their proximity to people.

Before, we never used to have to wear a mask when you visit the gorillas, but now you have to wear a mask when you visit the gorillas.

And I think it’s going to continue to be emphasized even after the pandemic, whenever it ends. I think we’re going to continue with all these regulations.

Brian Resnick

I imagine you can’t put a mask on a gorilla or have them protect themselves.

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Absolutely not. You can’t. And the problem with them is that they don’t know how to social distance. They are in a harem with a lead silverback and many females and babies and a few other adult males. And they’re always grooming each other, they’re always moving together as a group. So if one of them gets Covid-19, it’s very easy for the rest of them to get it because they don’t know how to social distance.

So the best we can do is teach people to social distance from them. And also at the same time, hand hygiene has really been reinforced, and use of hand sanitizer.

Many human diseases can infect gorillas

Brian Resnick

Is this a constant problem: diseases passing between people and these gorillas?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Yes. Disease becomes an issue once you habituate [gorillas] for tourism and research, because you get close enough to make them sick. Either when gorillas are visited inside the park [or] when gorillas go out of the park to people’s gardens, they can pick up diseases.

In 1996, actually, one of the first outbreaks that I had to handle was when the gorillas walked outside the park to eat people’s banana plants and they found dirty clothing and scarecrows and got scabies. It caused death in an infant.

So, yeah, we’re worried about those kinds of diseases. Influenza viruses are also a very big worry for us, other diseases that cause the common cold, and other viral respiratory diseases.

Brian Resnick

Is it generally the case that any virus that can infect a human can infect a gorilla?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Yes, all of them, because we share 98.4 percent genetic material and can easily make each other sick.

Let’s say a gorilla gets Covid-19. What happens next?

Brian Resnick

Do you worry if one gorilla gets sick, it could kill them? Do we know how Covid-19 would present itself in a gorilla?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

The same way that it has varied effects in people — some people don’t show symptoms, some people it’s mild symptoms, others it’s very severe. We feel that the same thing could happen with the gorillas. We’ve known that when gorillas get diseases like scabies, it’s very severe in the gorillas, more severe than it would be in a human being.

People, gorillas, chimps, and other old-world primates like some of the monkeys and baboons, we share the same protein receptor that the SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to. Which probably means that the way that it can make us sick is the way that it can make them sick.

Brian Resnick

Are you prepared to treat the gorillas? Is there a plan?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

We definitely would. If the gorillas were to get it, there’s a contingency plan that has been developed with other conservation partners. It’s been led by the International Gorilla Conservation Programme.

If Covid-19 gets into one gorilla, that gorilla group has to be quarantined — it’s not allowed to mix with any other gorilla group. Once they start to mix, then we have a complete disaster on our hands, complete disaster. So the first thing is to cordon off that group.

Brian Resnick

How do you quarantine gorillas?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

So the park rangers have to be with them 24 hours basically to make sure they don’t mix with other groups. At least they have to be with them from the beginning of the day to the end of the day because at night they don’t move around. They just stay in their nests.

Brian Resnick

If one gets sick, would you use some of the therapies that have been developed for humans, or ...

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

They’ll be treated with the same things that are being used to treat people.

But it’s much more difficult to treat a wild animal than it is to treat a human being. You can’t provide the same level of intensive treatment to a wild gorilla as you would a human being who you can put in a hospital ward, put on a ventilator for days and days. Because there’s just over 1,000 mountain gorillas remaining in the world ... we wouldn’t want Covid-19 to be the reason why they’re being wiped out.

Brian Resnick

When you said you can’t put them on a ventilator for days: Why not?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Because the gorillas are living in the wild and as much as possible we don’t want to disrupt them, bring them into a captive setting, put them though all of this and then release them back to the wild, because they could even return with more diseases that can affect the others. So it’s a very delicate balance. It’s very, very rare that we take in a gorilla, treat it in a hospital setting, and then release them out. As much as possible, we do all the treatments in the field.

Brian Resnick

How do you treat them in the field?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

You have to dart them with the drug because the mountain gorillas are not ... they only eat the food that they’re supposed to eat in the forest. They’re not fed. We don’t feed the mountain gorillas. They’re completely free-ranging, they’re completely wild.

Why resuming gorilla tourism is worth the risk

Brian Resnick

Is resuming tourism worth the risk of potentially bringing Covid-19 into the park?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Yes. We think that is worth the risk, for sure. The local communities of Bwindi have become so reliant on gorilla tourism to survive — which is good and bad. It’s good in that they feel that the gorillas are their survival. The future of the gorillas is tied in with their future. So they really protect [them].

When tourism went down and there was no tourists coming in, everybody was struggling. The local economy suffered and poaching went up. In other parts of Africa, people actually eat gorillas as a delicacy.

So if you don’t have tourism, it’s very hard to protect the gorillas because grant money is not necessarily enough, especially now. The only gorilla subspecies whose population is increasing is the one where tourism is happening.

Do the gorillas notice anything unusual going on?

Brian Resnick

Do you think the gorillas know something different is happening? Have they noticed people wearing masks or noticed the greater distance between them and people?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

I guess they were used to being visited often by people every day. Different people come and spend an hour with them and go away. And so one thing I think they’re finding a bit strange is that they can’t get close to people like they used to. So we’re kind of de-habituating them.

But one thing that we’ve been happy about is that more gorillas are being born. More gorillas are being born this year than other years. And we don’t know whether it’s to do with a lack of tourism or just coincidental. Research has to be done on that.

Could a gorilla be vaccinated?

Brian Resnick

As we see the vaccines for humans get approved by various governments, could you potentially vaccinate these gorillas, or is that not something that would happen?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

Vaccination of gorillas cannot be ruled out, but to vaccinate gorillas we have to make sure that it’s really, really, really safe for humans. I think it’s going to take a while to see how humans react to the vaccine. And we need to see how much they are actually protected as a result of the vaccine.

Yeah, we need more data to know whether it’s safe on the gorillas.

Brian Resnick

Would you say this pandemic is an existential threat to gorillas?

Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka

This virus is a threat to the gorillas. It definitely is a threat to gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans — the three non-human great apes. Just this morning I was having a chat with people working with orangutans and we were talking about some of the things that I’m talking about with you: how do we protect these great apes during a pandemic like Covid-19, the people looking after them, the people who come to visit them.

It’s also a big threat to other wildlife. It came from wildlife, it can easily go back to wildlife, and that’s something that we’re all very concerned about.",voxdotcom,"['mountain', 'gorilla', 'theyre', 'covid19', 'tourism', 'park', 'treat', 'gorillas', 'dont', 'distancing', 'humans', 'used', 'diseases']",0

2020-12-16 22:18:33+00:00,25,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-12-16 18:50:06+00:00,13,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2020-12-16 14:30:05+00:00,17,"Share All sharing options for: A wild mink in Utah has Covid-19. Veterinarians fear this is just the beginning.

It started in nature. A coronavirus that originated in bats has wound up in humans, causing the Covid-19 pandemic.

And it can go back to nature.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus can jump again, from humans, back into animals, back into wildlife, where it can wait, mutate, and change. Perhaps, years from now, it can infect people again.

“If we’re careful — and we’re lucky — there won’t be a wildlife population that becomes infected and becomes an established reservoir that can also infect people,” Sarah Olson, associate director of the health program at the Wildlife Conservation Society, says. “If it does, then we’ve got a long-term issue here, where this virus has the potential to be with us for millennia. And millennia is a long time. The risk may be small, but the consequences are huge.”

Our luck may soon be tested. On December 13, the US Department of Agriculture reported that a wild mink in Utah tested positive for the coronavirus.

“To our knowledge, this is the first free-ranging, native wild animal confirmed with SARS-CoV-2,” the National Veterinary Services Laboratories reported. A genetic analysis of the virus suggested the wild mink picked it up from a nearby mink farm, perhaps via wastewater runoff from the farm.

No other species surrounding the farm were found to be infected, though, and there’s no evidence that Covid-19 is spreading among wild mink. One possibility is the wild mink could have just picked it up from the farm and has not spread it since.

Another possibility: We haven’t yet detected a bigger outbreak. “This is potentially going to be a more widespread problem in wild mink,” says Stephanie Seifert, a researcher at Washington State University’s school for global animal health. It’s “very unlikely they swabbed the only wild mink with SARS-CoV-2.”

Mink are just one species. There’s no comprehensive analysis of all the animals in the world, whether or not they can get Covid-19 and spread it among themselves, and potentially to other wildlife. The virus could be establishing copies of itself in nature right now, and we would have no real-time way of knowing.

The light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic is growing brighter, however. Safe, effective vaccines are now starting to be distributed in the US. But the eventual end of the pandemic will likely not mean the end of SARS-CoV-2. It may still sporadically, or more regularly — no one really knows — infect animals and wildlife across the world.

In the right animal host, the virus could lurk for years before an opportune moment to jump back into humans. Over that time, the virus could change a bit, mutating into a form that could evade the current vaccines.

Several species have been infected so far: cats, dogs, lions, tigers, pumas, mink, and, most recently, snow leopards. More species have been shown, in lab studies, to be vulnerable to infection.

But scientists are still investigating: How many more animals could potentially catch SARS-CoV-2, and what will it mean for the course of the pandemic and for the health of wildlife?

To avoid the worst, scientists and veterinarians need to know which animals SARS-CoV-2 could potentially infect, and figure out the chances of the virus jumping from humans to the animals and back to humans again.

Can dogs catch coronavirus? Can cats? Lions? What else?

Scientists already know of many types of animals that can catch SARS-CoV-2. They know it because the virus originated in the animal world — likely in bats. They also know it because they’ve seen several species of animals get infected.

Early on in the pandemic, tigers at the Bronx Zoo got sick (three of them had a cough) with the virus. Veterinarians have since found signs of Covid-19 infections in some of the animals that humans spend the most time with.

Jonathan Runstadler, a veterinarian at Tufts University, is running a surveillance study of animals that come in for treatment at the school’s veterinary clinic. So far, they’re finding “a few percent of those domestic pet dogs and cats are developing antibodies to this SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Runstadler says, meaning their bodies have encountered the infection and mounted an immune response.

“It is unknown where the infection or virus they responded to came from,” he says, but the “highest likelihood” scenario was that it came from human household members. Overall, he says, it’s not a lot of animals getting infected, but it’s clear that dogs and cats can, in some instances, be infected with the virus.

Cats seem to be more susceptible than dogs overall (though the cats themselves don’t seem to get very sick). Dogs are a highly diverse species. “So it’s possible that there may be specific breeds or types of dogs that are more susceptible, we don’t really know,” Siefert says.

Other animals have been shown to be much more susceptible not just to infection but to severe disease and even death. In Denmark, authorities ordered the culling of millions of captive mink after outbreaks occurred on hundreds of farms.

The concern wasn’t just that the virus was spreading among the mink, making them sick, making their breathing difficult, and killing many. It was that the virus had jumped from the mink and then back into people, with some genetic changes to the spike protein that the virus uses to enter cells.

“If the virus does begin circulating in a new species, the results will really be unpredictable,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, says. The virus is constantly mutating, changing in subtle ways. When it enters a new species, that species’ immune system makes it so a significantly altered strain of the virus emerges. “The real question is whether it will change in a way that is more or less detrimental to the human population,” she says.

Once a disease establishes itself in wildlife, “it’s just exponentially harder to control”

Currently, there’s no clear evidence that the genetic changes that occurred on the mink farm would make the virus more likely to evade a person’s immune system or diminish the efficacy of a vaccine. But Denmark’s health authorities didn’t want to risk it. So they ordered the culling of all the mink. (Denmark’s health minister who made the decision has since resigned.)

The mink were a bit of a ticking time bomb: The virus spreads easily among mink in farms because they are kept in close quarters (the same ease of transmission happens among humans in close quarters).

Researchers are trying to figure out which animals could spread the virus from humans back to wildlife

It’s relatively easy to keep track of the virus in farmed animals. Their health is regularly monitored. Farmers notice when mink start dying. But what happens if the virus gets into an animal that spreads the virus asymptomatically, or gets into wildlife, which would be harder to track?

Once a disease establishes itself in wildlife, Olson says, “It’s just exponentially harder to control. I mean, you can barely get people to take vaccines. Imagine wildlife. You just have very limited options.”

The USDA maintains there “is currently no evidence” that the virus has established itself in wild mink populations near the farm where it was found. “It is important that surveillance in wildlife around infected mink farms continue, to identify if the virus enters local wildlife populations,” the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service spokesperson said in a statement to Vox.

Researchers can’t study every animal species on Earth and test whether it can carry SARS-CoV-2. They’re focusing their research on animals that could act as conduits between humans and wildlife.

Anna Fagre, a veterinarian and microbiology researcher at Colorado State University, is doing this research on deer mice. In a lab study, Fagre and colleagues revealed that deer mice can contract the virus and spread it among other deer mice.

Deer mice are common animals in rural areas. “We see them, if staying in, like, cabins in the woods, [deer] mice are going to set up shop there,” Fagre says. Deer mice are known to occasionally spread other viruses, and they exist at the interface between human dwelling and the broader natural world. They could be a conduit ferrying SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other wildlife.

In her lab, “we were able to inoculate and infect these deer mice, and they actually did transmit the virus to other mice they were housed with,” Fagre says. They experienced subtle symptoms like losing a bit of weight, and they “get a little bit quiet,” she says (quieter than, um, a mouse). Then, a few days later, they recover. That subtle illness might make it hard to realize if there are suddenly a lot of deer mice with the virus. Plus, these are not captive animals. If a viral mutation emerged among them, it would be discovered much later than what occurred in the mink.

“When this preprint [study] came out,” she says, “some people were like, ‘Oh, my god, this is so scary: deer mice! We’ll never get rid of the virus if deer mice become infected.’”

For Fagre, her results aren’t a reason to panic. It was just a lab study. The results don’t mean there are deer mice running around rural areas with the virus. They also don’t mean the mice will become a source of future infection for humans.

“There are so many different steps the virus would have to take to spill back from humans into deer mice, and then circulate in deer mice, and then be transmitted back from deer mice into humans,” she says. “I’m not saying it couldn’t happen. It certainly could. Cross-species transmission is what led to the Covid-19 pandemic.” The research helps scientists be vigilant. “It’s important to be aware,” she says.

Rare human-to-animal-to-human jumps could have huge consequences

Being aware of which animals can be infected with the virus helps researchers ask new questions, too. House cats of all sorts seem to be susceptible to the virus. “I live in kind of a rural area of eastern Washington and I’ve actually caught deer mice in my house,” Seifert says. “So I’m like, can my cat, if he kills deer mice, can my cat contract SARS-CoV-2? I don’t know.”

That is unclear. Also unclear: if there are circumstances where a cat could pass the virus to a human. It’s possible, but it has yet to be seen.

“We know that in experimental studies that this can go from cat to cat,” Danielle Adney, a veterinarian-researcher working with the National Institutes of Health, says. “In the real world, it really seems like every animal that’s been reported has a pretty clear link to an infected human. So this is still a pandemic that’s driven almost exclusively by human-to-human contact.”

(Pet owners don’t have to be wary of their cats infecting them. That said: A few of the veterinarians said their colleagues need to be really careful and wear good personal protective equipment and N95 masks when working on cats — particularly if they’re doing dental work.)

But we know that rare events can have devastating consequences. It was rare for SARS-CoV-2 to jump from bats to humans. “I’m very worried about cats,” Rasmussen says. “There’s a lot of feral cats out there in the world. There’s also a lot of people who have outdoor cats that may or may not interact with other feral cats or other outdoor cats. And then if those cats are coming back and snuggling with their owners, that’s a potential source for the virus to spill over for future ... introductions into the human population.”

She’s not saying this will happen or that it’s currently happening. She’s saying it’s something to monitor. Because “if it [the virus] got into something like cats, and became widespread among cats, that would be a huge problem in terms of being able to control it long term.”

It’s still unknown which species ferried the coronavirus from bats to humans in Wuhan, China. It could have been bats, but it could have been another species. Perhaps a similar species is found in other parts of the world and can carry the virus back and forth between humans and animals.

In the near term, vaccines will help avoid the virus jumping back from animals to humans. But 10 or 20 years from now, how many people will still be vaccinated and immune to Covid-19? No one knows. Thinking about Covid-19 in animals is to think about the bigger picture, on a longer timeline. Covid-19 could essentially hide in animals for years, waiting, subtly mutating and changing, before making a jump back into humans.

What’s hard about this topic is all the (literal) moving, crawling, trotting, scampering pieces: There are so many species, interacting with us in so many ways, interacting with other members of their own species in so many ways, interacting with other species in so many ways. In that sense, studying Covid-19 in animals is an opportunity to better understand the complicated ways diseases spread from animals to humans and back again. That could help keep SARS-CoV-2 at bay, but it could also help prevent future pandemics.

The research on Covid-19 and animals has uncovered some good news, too.

“Luckily, ducks and chickens and pigs have all been shown not to be susceptible, in laboratory studies, and cows have really low susceptibility,” Fagre says. That means that the situation that happened on mink farms is unlikely to occur on farms where these more common animals are raised as livestock.

It’s not just about human health, but animal health as well

Veterinarians can think of a lot of potentially scary scenarios here. Some of them are scary not just in terms of human health, but for animal health, too.

Scientists have conducted broad surveys of animal biology, noting which animals have a cellular receptor similar to the ACE-2 receptor in humans. This is a protein found on the surface of many human cells that the virus uses as a front door to start hijacking the cell and replicating within it.

At the top of the list of potentially most at-risk animals are some of the most critically endangered species on the planet, and some of our closest genetic relatives in the natural world.

At the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda, veterinarian and conservationist Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka is concerned about a potential outbreak among the park’s 460 mountain gorillas, which represent nearly half of all mountain gorillas left in the wild.

Gorillas share 98.4 percent of their DNA with humans. They have a similar immune system and have similar cellular proteins through which SARS-CoV-2 enters to infect the body. If one of these precious few gorillas got infected, Kalema-Zikusoka worries they would get sick and die. Worse, the disease could spread rapidly among them.

“They don’t know how to social distance,” Kalema-Zikusoka says. Likewise, there’s no putting a mask on a 300-plus-pound wild gorilla. “They’re always grooming each other, they’re always moving together as a group. So if one of them gets Covid-19, it’s very easy for the rest of them to get it.”

The virus, she says, plainly “is a threat to the gorillas,” as well as to chimpanzees and orangutans, which also share an overwhelming amount of DNA with humans. It’s not easy to treat a wild gorilla if it gets sick. And if one does, she says, the plan is to quarantine potentially exposed gorillas via 24-hour monitoring by park workers in the forest.

“You can’t provide the same level of intensive treatment to a wild gorilla as you would a human being, who you can put in a hospital ward, put on a ventilator for days and days,” she says. Instead, they would try to treat the gorillas in their own habitat, shooting pharmaceutical-loaded darts at the animals, if need be.

“The best we can do,” she adds, “is teach people to social distance from them.” Since the pandemic began, all people visiting the gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda must wear masks, they must get their temperatures checked, and they must stay 10 meters (32 feet) away from the animals.

Just as Covid-19 threatens gorilla conservation in Uganda, in North America, researchers are worried about bats. In recent years, millions of North American bats have died of a fungal disease called white nose syndrome. The pandemic threatens bats, for one, because it has basically shut down research on live bats. There’s fear that humans could give the bats the virus and start an outbreak among them. “We don’t know if that can happen and which species that can happen in,” Siefert says. But considering how this virus likely originated in bats, scientists don’t want to risk it.

There’s no knowing what SARS-CoV-2 would do to bats in North America or which species it could infect. Perhaps more would get sick and die. If infected, North American bats could become a reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, a potential source of the virus for other wildlife and, down the line, for more human infections.

All the veterinarians I spoke to stressed that whatever is happening with Covid-19 in animals right now, it’s not as critical, or dire, as the situation in humans. It makes obvious sense that there are more resources currently going into tracking the spread among people than tracking the spread among animals.

“Thousands of people are dying every day from this virus,” Fagre says. “Everyone’s first priority isn’t screening a bunch of wild rodents to see if they’ve been exposed.”

But down the line, perhaps we should prioritize them. Covid-19 is leaving a lot of shadow imprints on the world. It has upended lives and industries. But it’s also potentially burrowing itself back into nature, where it will wait. This virus came from nature, and it may very well return there. Scientists ought to track it as it does.

“This isn’t going to be the last spillover event,” Olson says, where a virus jumps from animals to humans. “We owe it to future generations to get our act together here.”",voxdotcom,"['utah', 'animals', 'mice', 'sarscov2', 'fear', 'cats', 'deer', 'virus', 'covid19', 'species', 'mink', 'wild', 'veterinarians', 'humans', 'beginning']",0
2020-12-16 00:42:50+00:00,11,"It’s been a busy week in vaccine news: The FDA authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine in the US on December 11, and the vaccination campaign is underway. The first US health workers received the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on December 14.

With all of the news around coronavirus vaccines, of course, come a lot of questions. Vox science reporter Umair Irfan joined Today, Explained in a live conversation with host Sean Rameswaram to answer some of the biggest questions from our podcast listeners. (A transcript of their conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below.)

The live podcast event also featured a conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci. The nation’s leading infectious disease scientist spoke about everything from his personal reflections on the past year to what it will take to get to “true herd immunity.”

The Fauci segment of this live podcast event will air next week as part of the Today, Explained upcoming podcast series “You, Me, and Covid-19,” which looks back on how the coronavirus has fundamentally reshaped our world. Through reporting, listener reflections, and interviews, the team will examine how Covid-19 changed our relationships with one another and with the places we live, upended our livelihoods, and redefined what we think of as “normal.”

The first episode of the series drops on Monday, December 21, and continues throughout the week. Subscribe to Today, Explained wherever you listen to podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Spotify — so you don’t miss an episode.

How is the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine different from existing vaccines for other diseases? And how does the vaccine work?

The one thing to highlight is the unprecedented speed at which we have developed this. Vaccine development is something that typically takes decades. The fastest vaccine ever developed was the mumps vaccine that took four years. This was a disease we only discovered last year around this time.

And now about a year later, we already have a vaccine that’s starting to be distributed. So this is something that’s unprecedented in terms of science. And the other big thing to highlight is that this is also using a completely new technology. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine are using an approach [with] the RNA-based genetic material. This is something that we’ve never tried on large scales in humans before.

So the old-fashioned way of doing viruses or vaccines was you would take the virus — weaken it, kill it, or snip off a piece of it — and inject it into the body. And then your immune system would read that and develop a response. They would use it as sort of a punching bag to essentially prepare for when the virus actually invades.

What these new generations of vaccines are doing is you don’t need the virus at all. In fact, all you do is you start with the genetic material. That is the information used to code for how to make the virus. And you don’t even need to know how to make the whole virus. You only need to know how to make a piece of it, like the spike proteins.

So with the coronavirus, the spike proteins are really important because that’s what they use to break into cells. They’re kind of like lock picks. And so what [companies] like Moderna and Pfizer have done is they took the instructions in RNA and they basically inject those into the human body, into muscles, and then your own cells will read those instructions and then manufacture their own copies of those specific spike proteins. Then, your immune system will use that as target practice.

And so this is, again, something that we’ve never done before, but it’s extremely fast. The first mRNA vaccines were developed within days of the genetic sequence of the coronavirus being released publicly. And then within two months, they were tested in the first humans.

Who qualifies for getting the Covid-19 vaccine now? And when might everyone else actually be able to get it?

Let’s start backwards and work toward where we are now. Ultimately, we want everybody to be vaccinated against this as much as possible because this is a disease that can infect just about everybody. So that’s the ultimate goal post, trying to get as close to saturation.

But, of course, we can’t do that right away. So the Centers for Disease Control convened an advisory committee, and they looked at where would these vaccines be most effective, not just in terms of preventing deaths but also in terms of preventing spread.

If we can inoculate [people who are most likely to spread the virus to other people], we can control transmission. They found out that those people are likely going to be health workers. So the first priority on the list are logically going to be health workers, but also people who live in long-term care facilities, older adults, and particularly the people that work around them.

“Your odds of getting a vaccine — or when you will get it — really depend on your city, your state, how many vaccines they received, and how effectively they’re distributing them”

The idea is that these people can act as sort of firebreaks against this inferno of a pandemic. The problem, though, is when you add up those people just in those high-risk groups, that’s 24 million people. And we’re not going to have 24 million doses right away. Operation Warp Speed estimates that [it] will have just about 20 million Americans inoculated by the end of December. And that’s if everything goes perfectly well, which means that there will still be some people that will have to wait.

So it really is going to vary from state to state and even from region to region. Different states and different hospitals have their own guidelines. Some of them are developing an algorithm which sorts out who is at highest risk. Some of them are awarding vaccines based on a lottery system. Your odds of getting a vaccine — or when you will get it — really depend on your city, your state, how many vaccines they received, and how effectively they’re distributing them.

Can people get Covid-19 between the two doses?

Yes. Both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are two-dose vaccines administered about several weeks apart.

Last week, before Pfizer/BioNTech received their emergency use authorization from the FDA, they released some of their data showing their trial pool. The data showed that they had about 160-some people who got infected with Covid-19 in the placebo group and about nine people that got infected in the group that got the vaccine.

But if you look at when they got infected, most of those nine people were infected just a few days after they received the first dose of the vaccine. So between the first and second dose, building up an immune response is something that can take several days up to a couple of weeks. It’s likely that they were still vulnerable in that window where they were infected. Basically, the vaccine hadn’t kicked in yet, and so they were able to get infected and get sick in that specific time frame.

Can people get Covid-19 after receiving both doses of the vaccine?

Yes. There were a couple of people that, I think, were reported to have received the vaccine to have come down with Covid-19 after getting the second dose. Those will have to be investigated further; that’s why we don’t say this vaccine is 100 percent effective. Ninety-five percent effective is still very high. But it also means that not every single person who gets a vaccine is ultimately going to have protection, which means we still have to take some precautions even after getting vaccinated.

What do we know about the long-term health effects of the Covid-19 vaccine?

We’re still learning about them. Generally, we would expect most complications with vaccines to happen shortly after you get the vaccine. Even though we’re only getting the results of the phase 3 clinical trials in the past few weeks, you know, we’ve had phase 1 and phase 2 trial results for several months. So, we know for the most part that most people don’t really have a severe reaction to this.

The main side effects after getting the vaccine are going to be muscle pain, weakness, some redness and soreness, and a mild fever. Those are the most common complaints. We don’t really have good long-term safety data just simply for the fact that this virus and this vaccine [have] not been around very long. In order to get the emergency use authorization, Pfizer had to provide two months of safety data. But they’ve also committed to following their candidates in their phase 3 clinical trial for up to two years, basically actively monitoring them and tracking them. They’re also going to continue paying attention to people in the general population as they receive the vaccine.

Now, it’s very likely that any risks associated with this are very, very low, because vaccines are drugs that are tested to a very high standard. They go out of their way to make sure that complication rates are very low. Generally, these are some of the safest pharmaceutical drugs that we have ever developed. But again, the risk is not zero. There are some people that may experience some complications, and it’s worth trying to take steps ahead of time to try to minimize them, to see what risk factors lead to complications, and then also helping out the folks that do actually have any kind of trouble with them afterwards.

How might having a Covid-19 vaccine change behavior in the US?

These vaccines are very effective against disease, meaning that they will prevent you from getting sick. But we don’t really know how well they prevent infection or transmission. It’s likely that the people who get vaccinated may be able to still spread this virus to other people. And that’s why behavior can’t really change that much from where it is right now.

[The vaccine is] useful in that we can keep people out of hospitals and from dying or getting seriously ill. But precautions like wearing masks and maintaining social distance, those are all going to be important even after the vaccines start rolling out. Even after you and I get vaccinated, we’re going to have to maintain that until transmission lowers enough to the point that we can start letting our foot off the accelerator here. And so that’s why we need to be really paying attention to this.

“There’s potential for somebody who’s vaccinated to still get seriously ill, so it’s important to take precautions, even for your own sake”

The other thing is, with vaccines, you don’t want to necessarily use that as an excuse to engage in risky behavior because, again, it’s 95 percent effective, not 100 percent effective. There’s potential for somebody who’s vaccinated to still get seriously ill, so it’s important to take precautions, even for your own sake.

Over time, we do expect some behavior change, things like allowing kids to go to school in person or allowing certain kinds of events or gatherings that are urgently needed, certain kinds of, like, academic programs or other things like that. And then allowing some people to go to work, for instance. Those changes will eventually start to happen as we get transmission down and as vaccination rates go up. But both of those things need to happen at the same time, and that’s going to take some time to do.

If someone’s had Covid-19 before and already has antibodies, should they still get the vaccine?

The recommendations right now are likely going to be that you still get the vaccine. The reason is that while being naturally infected with the virus gives you some degree of immunity and protection, it’s not necessarily targeted. The vaccines are optimized specifically to neutralize the virus and its infection and how it causes disease, whereas with your own natural infection, you will produce antibodies, but they’re more scattershot. They’ll target some of the parts of the virus that cause infection, but they’ll target other parts that don’t necessarily interfere with its reproduction cycle. So it’s very likely that most people, even if they have gotten sick with this, it would be useful for them to still get vaccinated.

How is it possible to still spread the coronavirus after someone’s been vaccinated?

What we’ve seen with the coronavirus in general is that most people don’t get seriously ill. And there’s a number of people that can have the virus and spread it without showing any symptoms at all. That means your immune system doesn’t even mount a response, and the virus doesn’t really do much damage to you.

It’s likely that even after your body gets coached to fight off this infection, the infection might be so low grade that it doesn’t really do anything. It doesn’t even trigger the alarm bells in your body, but it still allows you to spread the virus to other people. And that low level of infection or transmission still poses a risk.

Now, there’s some evidence, especially with Moderna’s data that was just put out today, that seems to indicate that their vaccine actually does lower transmission. So it’s very likely we would actually see a dent in transmission by getting this vaccine, but it’s not as steep of a drop as we saw with reductions in disease. You’ll likely have a lower risk of making other people sick, but not as low as the risk of keeping yourself from getting sick.

Do kids need to get the Covid-19 vaccine? Is it safe for them to get it?

That’s really hard to say because children were explicitly excluded from these clinical trials. In fact, that was one of the big sources of contention during the meeting last week with the advisers to the Food and Drug Administration. They were looking at trial data, and they said that the youngest people in the trial were 16 years old and there weren’t that many of them. [The advisers] were wondering: “Is this a vaccine that we can approve for everyone over the age of 16, or should we raise that to everyone over the age of 18?”

They eventually approved language saying everyone over the age of 16. And it’s very likely that it will be safer in younger people. But with an emergency use authorization, you’re balancing risk and reward, because you’re looking at the potential benefit but you’re also looking at any potential harm.

Now, we know, for instance, that children are much less likely to get severely ill from this virus compared to, say, adults and much older adults. And looking at that risk-reward calculation right now, it seems that it doesn’t really weigh in favor of vaccinating children, [though] that could change in the future as they do more trials and testing and as we learn more about the disease. But for now, we’re looking mainly at health workers and older adults.

Is the Covid-19 vaccine going to be something like the flu shot, where we need to get something every year?

It depends on how fast the virus mutates. What we’ve seen so far is that it tends to be pretty stable in the parts of the virus that we’re most concerned about. That likely means that protection will last for a few years. Our experiences with SARS and MERS show that protection against those viruses also lasts for a few years. But eventually, the virus will change enough, and you’ll have to restart the process. You might need a booster a few years from now if there is still an outbreak or an epidemic. But it’s very likely that once you get the vaccine, you’ll have some room to breathe easy for a while.

What is most important for people to remember now that this vaccine is out there, and we’re also in this terrible position where the country hit 300,000 Covid-19 deaths?

The [thing] to remember is that our actions do matter. I use the firebreak analogy. The vaccines are like cutting firebreaks, cutting clearings in a forest so that the fire doesn’t spread. But that really doesn’t do much if there’s already a huge inferno that’s blazing. Our goal right now is to reduce transmission as much as possible so that when a vaccine does roll out, it becomes that much more effective.

There’s this herd immunity threshold of 80 to 90 percent of people being immune … where the pandemic starts to fizzle out. But we start to see reductions at around 30 to 40 percent. And that can happen if we do a good job of controlling transmission. Our actions right now to try to limit the spread of the virus will make it easier and more effective for when a vaccine does start being administered to people who are in the low-risk pools, maybe next spring and maybe into early summer.

2020-12-15 21:20:04+00:00,20,"When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”

After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.

Before Covid-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.

Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.

Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a Covid-19 infection. While early research on Covid-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.

On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long Covid, or long-haul Covid — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.

Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-Covid care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.

Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long Covid. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of Covid-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.

Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long Covid and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.

Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long Covid. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-Covid patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.

Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.

Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction

One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.

The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also Covid-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-Covid patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.

“A lot of people with long Covid notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-Covid symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”

Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long Covid is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.

Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long Covid from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.

Long Covid can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.

“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on Covid-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”

Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)

A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”

Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in Covid-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.

In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of Covid-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.

Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having Covid-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”

The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”

Beyond Covid-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.

Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help Covid-19 patients.

But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-Covid clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”

Pulmonary problems

Long-Covid symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-Covid patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-Covid patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”

She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-Covid patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.

Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long Covid.

Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-Covid symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.

New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic Covid-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.

In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of Covid-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)

The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.

It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-Covid patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.

Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues

Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many Covid-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.

Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a Covid-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”

It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in Covid-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.

A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.

But Covid-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 Covid-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.

“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild Covid-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.

Many long-Covid patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.

Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got Covid-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his Covid-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-Covid patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)

Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe Covid-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.

Immune system

Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of Covid-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.

Some long-Covid patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.

Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with Covid-19 in March and have had long-Covid symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe Covid-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.

Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long Covid, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.

Nervous system

New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-Covid patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with Covid-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-Covid patients.

Some long-Covid patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.

Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.

There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.

One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 Covid-19 patients in the UK.

Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The Covid crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long Covid.”

But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.

Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with Covid-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”

One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get Covid-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”

Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-Covid symptoms reported by parents of children who have had Covid-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”

Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got Covid-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.

Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.

Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long Covid, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.

Children and long Covid

As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of Covid-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long Covid in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.

That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-Covid cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.

Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.

While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US Covid-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute Covid-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.

While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-Covid cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-Covid kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.

Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long Covid. “In many families who have kids with long Covid, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.

But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.

Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.

One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-Covid symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.

For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.

“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-12-15 15:30:07+00:00,18,"Case numbers, positivity rates, deaths, and hospitalizations have become the go-to metrics for tracking the severity of the coronavirus pandemic. But one symptom of the pandemic, impacting both those who’ve had the virus and those who haven’t, has proven more difficult to quantify: deteriorating mental health. Perhaps because of this challenge, it has been largely absent from the messaging and response of public officials.

A close look at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data shows that one measure of mental health is far more intimately tied to the state of the pandemic than previously imagined. In fact, their trajectories align almost exactly.

It is well documented that the coronavirus pandemic has taken a serious toll on emotional well-being. Rates of depression and anxiety in June were three to four times higher than at the corresponding point in 2019, according to the CDC, and deteriorating mental health outcomes have been similarly observed in nations across the world, among them the UK, India, and China. Rates of suicidal ideation, substance abuse, and alcohol consumption are rising steadily.

But the connection is even stronger than you might think in the US: As the number of new cases of the virus fluctuates week to week, our mental health moves in lockstep.

Data available from the Mental Health Household Pulse Survey, run by the CDC, offers a week-by-week estimate of the fraction of Americans who experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression between April 23 and July 21. Comparing this data to the weekly US coronavirus cases over the same time interval reveals an unmistakable trend: The incidence of depressive or anxious symptoms among Americans almost exactly mirrors the trajectory of the US coronavirus curve.

With an r2 value (a standard metric of correlation strength) of 0.92 between new Covid-19 cases and the incidence of anxious or depressive symptoms, the correlation between them is very, very strong.

It is always possible that any correlation could be coincidental rather than causal, or that the link could be more complicated than it seems. Indeed, June and July marked a period of increasing viral spread; one might speculate that, as the pandemic stretched on, public mental health could have correspondingly worsened simply as a function of time or some other factor.

Yet data from the second phase of the Household Pulse Survey, from August through October, showed mental health continued to consistently follow fluctuations in the Covid-19 curve. After the scary viral spike in July, the number of weekly cases declined from roughly 450,000 per week at the end of July to roughly 250,000 by the end of August. And along with this period of slower viral spread, mental health outcomes markedly improved as well, reinforcing the relationship between the two.

Then again, as cases increased during September and October, mental health outcomes correspondingly worsened.

We don’t know yet exactly why reports of mental health issues trace much of the coronavirus curve — whether it is cause and effect, the result of other variables, or some unlikely causal relationship in the other direction. For example, as people become more depressed and anxious, perhaps they seek social interaction more carelessly, generating infection spikes. And the points where the two curves diverge somewhat (e.g., June and late October) show that there are certainly other factors at play.

What is clear is that the rampant spread of the virus is having a major effect on mental health. Overall, the pandemic has raised America’s baseline levels of anxiety and depression: Even at its lowest point this summer (early May), the rate of Americans reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression hovered around 34 percent, roughly three times higher than the average of 11 percent reported in a parallel study between January and June 2019.

Fluctuations above this already-high baseline could plausibly be caused, at least in part, by the severity of the pandemic at a given point in time. For example, elevated rates of viral spread directly increase the likelihood that we or someone we know will become exposed and undergo a mentally straining period of quarantining waiting for symptoms — or self-isolation while battling the new illness itself. The state of the pandemic also often determines things like freedom of mobility through lockdown measures or their absence.

Historically, imposed quarantine has been shown to dramatically affect mental health. Moreover, the perceived trajectory of the pandemic has significant repercussions for the economy and unemployment, both of which have been shown to directly impact mental health.

Covid-19 messaging and policies have fixated on the standard numbers of cases and deaths. But these numbers alone miss out on the very real, very strong connection between the pandemic and our mental health, which is impacting far more people than have been infected with the virus. And it is not only a question of decreased quality of life. Anxiety and depression have been shown to be major drains on the economy as well.

Looking at these charts, it is clear that our mental health traces the coronavirus curve. And just as rising case numbers have had a crushing impact on our psychological health, whatever has led to periods of decreased viral spread (e.g. masks, distancing, and other smart policies) seems to have improved our mental health. Policymakers should take this finding to heart and respond to the pandemic with the emotional well-being of the public in mind.

Hearteningly, Biden recently appointed a nurse with mental health expertise to his Covid Advisory Board. Come January, in addition to enacting policies to curb viral spread, the administration should directly address mental health — for example, by continuing to seek out experts in psychiatry and mental health, expanding access to telemental health services, and addressing the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on mental health among marginalized groups such as Black and Latino populations.

For the sake of our own sanity, let’s continue to take this virus seriously.

2020-12-15 12:57:27+00:00,10,"In June, Manumalo Ala’ilima got a call from a family member that their brother was hospitalized for Covid-19. Ala’ilima lives in Portland, Oregon, while the rest of their family — some of whom also contracted the virus — live in Southern California.

For a while, Ala’ilima was convinced their brother would soon recover. But during their daily calls, his breathing, already labored, grew fainter until he couldn’t call or text anymore. A week and a half later, their family spent three hours saying their goodbyes over video. Ala’ilima watched, from their phone, as the hospital staff pulled the plug on their brother’s life support.

“In my mind, I was thinking to myself — no, not my family,” said Ala’ilima, who is of Samoan and Tongan descent from American Samoa and Samoa. “The hardest thing was debating at that time whether or not to attend his funeral because Southern California was a hot spot. Like how would we reimagine what a cultural funeral would be like so that we could celebrate and honor my brother in a very safe and accessible way?”

As the co-chair and co-founder of the United Territories of Pacific Islanders Alliance Portland, or Utopia PDX — a nonprofit group run by and for queer and transgender Pacific Islanders — Ala’ilima was already aware of how much Covid-19 had impacted Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities. And how much they had been ignored.

When Oregon began publishing its weekly Covid-19 data report on the onset of the pandemic, Ala’ilima noticed that Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders had the highest infection rate out of all ethnic groups in the state — around 13.1 per 10,000 cases in the middle of April. And yet the group wasn’t even included in Oregon’s priority testing list when testing availability was limited in the state. Even the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still won’t acknowledge NHPI’s high Covid-19 death and hospitalization rates, only showing statistics for Black, Latino, and Asian populations. The CDC, like other government agencies, tend to aggregate Pacific Islander under the Asian demographic, which harmfully hides the high infection and death rates within the community.

Because of this lack of data and prioritization by government agencies, Utopia PDX then decided to pivot its mission from queer and transgender Pacific Islander advocacy work to providing Covid-19 resources for Oregon’s NHPI community. In fact, across the country, it has been up to Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander groups to help their own communities, including gathering data about Covid-19 testing, cases, and deaths.

“When this pandemic hit, we thought, ‘Do we let these government agencies derail our community?’ or ‘Are we going to help our community get the resources that they need in a culturally respectful and competent way?’” Ala’ilima said. “And a lot of us pivoted from our original missions, so that we could do this work together to serve our communities.”

In August, Ninez Ponce, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, and a group of scholars launched the Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander Covid-19 Data Policy Lab to collect, scrape, track, and interpret local Covid-19 data in NHPI communities, in collaboration with the coalition of Pacific Islander groups under the National Pacific Islander Covid-19 Response Team. As of December 2, the NHPI community has faced 30,832 positive cases and 366 deaths, according to the lab — but these numbers could be higher due to aggregated Asian American and Pacific Islander data in some states.

Ponce said when Covid-19 infection rates are calculated per 100,000 populations, the cases among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are the highest compared to any other racial or ethnic groups in 14 of the 21 states and Washington DC that report disaggregated NHPI data. Meanwhile, NHPI Covid-19 death rates are also the highest in 11 of the 16 states and DC that are reporting the demographic’s mortality data.

“NHPIs are currently seeing infection rates up to five times that of white people in Los Angeles County alone, and this impact is being felt across the country,” Ponce told Vox. “The impact on the NHPIs is devastating, and without accurate data, lives are lost each day.”

Why Pacific Islanders are at greater risk for Covid-19

Pacific Islanders, like other ethnic groups, are not a monolith. This growing group — 0.5 percent of the entire US population — includes Native Hawaiians, Chamorus, Samoans, Marshallese, Tongans, Fijians, and more. But for a long time, in general surveys and many government agency data, the diverse Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander group have been lumped under the Asian American category, despite many advocates saying the group is more likely appropriate under the Native American category. In fact, 8 out of 10 Pacific Islanders in the country are Indigenous to the US-colonized territories, according to a report by a White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

These US-colonized islands are scattered across the Pacific Ocean’s three regions — Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia. Before European and American voyagers began colonizing the islands, Indigenous Pacific Islanders, like Native Americans, had been co-existing with the land and water for centuries. But as result of colonialism, Pacific Islanders have long carried a disproportionate health burden, researchers have found. Food diets (in which foreigners provided them with mostly oily processed or canned food), major illnesses, economic practices, and even military contamination have all been linked to the colonial disruption of Pacific Islanders’ native lifestyle. And when many Pacific Islanders moved to the mainland US, they still encountered rampant racism and faced disparities.

Health experts like Ponce and Raynald Samoa, MD, the lead expert of the Pacific Islander Covid-19 Response Team, said that because Pacific Islanders already suffer disproportionately on many fronts — from chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease to socioeconomic barriers that block access to health insurance — they are more vulnerable to the severe impacts of Covid-19.

Even in Hawaii, the only state that disaggregates both Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander data, Pacific Islanders — excluding Native Hawaiians — show a huge disproportionate Covid-19 impact: Pacific Islander groups like Chuukese, Marshallese, and Samoan residents are more than twice as likely to suffer severe Covid-19 outcomes than other racial and ethnic groups in the state.

Before Ala’ilima’s brother passed away from Covid-19, he had high blood pressure and diabetes. He was also a former US Marine and had just retired from working at the Transportation Security Administration. While their family was playing it safe the whole time, Ala’ilima’s brother was the one doing the errands — so they believe that he contracted the disease while shopping for groceries.

The grieving process was the hardest part. “The pandemic is asking us how do we grieve in a totally different way that is considered appropriate,” they said. “It’s so hard. Even our family who were there couldn’t be with him in his last moments.”

Pacific Islander families tend to live in large, multi-generational, and close-knit homes. So if one family member gets infected, self-isolation is difficult and the ripple effects could be harrowing. “Many of our homes are multi-family,” Ala’ilima adds, “so it’s not just a nuclear family in a Westernized sense of just like maybe two parents and a child. We’re talking about multiple families for a household to be easily 10 or more.”

The Pacific Islander community — specifically Micronesians who are migrants under the Compact of Free Association (COFA) — are more likely than others to be uninsured, even excluded from Medicaid, and are more likely to be frontline essential workers, increasing their risk of exposure to the virus. COFA migrants, who come from the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau, have a unique relationship with the US in which they can travel, live and work in the US for free without a visa or time constraints — in exchange for permitting the US access to their Indigenous Pacific lands for military purposes. But for COFA migrants, access to health care is a constant battle.

“US Pacific Island territories have some of the highest rates of recruitment into the US Armed Forces, reflecting the commitment of our men and women who are willing to die in defense of the freedoms we Americans so richly enjoy,” Samoa, who also got Covid-19 earlier this year, said in recent testimony to Congress representatives. And yet, Pacific Islanders who are “at higher risk of infection ... report experiencing discrimination in health care settings and a mistrust in seeking health care services.”

Joseph Seia, executive director of the Pacific Islander Community Association in Washington state (PICA-WA), said that in the beginning of the pandemic, the community initially wanted to highlight the Marshallese experience and the historical injustice that they went through after the US military nuclear testing in their home islands. The long-term effects of exposure to nuclear radiation, such as cancer, birth defects, thyroid complications, and asthma, still linger in Marshallese communities and are easily a determinant of a pre-existing condition for Covid-19. But the same issues of environmental injustice and socioeconomic barriers could be seen as an overarching problem across communities.

“If you look at the actual breakdown, the nuance of it all, our community is suffering, not just the Marshallese, but every [Pacific Islander] group,” Seia said. “It’s just sad because everybody knows someone in the community who died.”

Grassroots Pacific Islander organizations are working around the clock

Since Covid-19 hit communities in March, NHPI advocates have been building regional Pacific Islander Covid-19 task forces, working under the national coalition, Pacific Islander Covid-19 Response Team, to not only provide resources, but to also address the underlying issues exacerbated by the pandemic such as health care disparities, housing and food insecurity, high poverty and unemployment rates, immigration barriers, and environmental racism.

In Oregon, Utopia PDX has been working with lawmakers like Oregon Rep. Suzanne Bonamici and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to prioritize COFA migrants in health care insurance and services. In Washington, PICA-WA has hosted town halls to weigh the needs of NHPI communities and have submitted reports to the governor’s office. Both groups have also been helping with economic needs, such as housing and food. In Hawaii, various organizations launched the NHPI Collective Covid-19 Awareness Prevention Campaign to curb the effects of the virus.

“We’re not gonna leave our people hanging,” Ala’ilima said. “I don’t like being in a situation where a disparity like this is impacting our community this way. But in a lot of ways, it brought us all closer together, that we know we have each other’s backs, and we’re able to advocate for ourselves.”

After NHPI leaders asked Ponce to help with gathering data from local and state health departments, other members of local and national Covid-19 response teams requested even more data for their counties and states. Ponce also helped train more NHPI volunteers to help with her work that it became a weekly meeting of sharing and checking data scrapes from different sources. Now, they have the NHPI Covid-19 data dashboard, which reports weekly Covid-19 statistics and synthesis of findings that NHPI advocacy groups could use in their individual reports. The data also influenced the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to include NHPI as a priority population in its vaccine allocation framework since it previously did not.

They’ve also been challenging government agencies, like the CDC, to expand their reporting and disaggregate NHPI communities — roughly nine months later, data is still lacking and some policies still tend to disregard the community. “The policies that will distribute recovery and equity dollars to disproportionately affected communities should not neglect the NHPI population,” Ponce said. “They should not be an afterthought.”

Grassroots organizations, including Utopia PDX and PICA-WA, aren’t giving up, either. Lately, they’ve been spreading public safety messages during the holiday season when most Pacific Islanders are drawn to gather with extended relatives.

“It’s using whatever influence we have to try to further our cause and our advocacy so we can get meaningful visibility and our voices magnified,” said Ala’ilima, adding that the memory of their brother is what’s driving the energy and heart of their advocacy work.

“I have a small family of my own — my partner and I and our 4-year-old, I have people to live for, and I have a community to live for,” they add. “I’m gonna do my best to make sure that I can keep them safe and that we can survive together in the near future someday safely.”",voxdotcom,"['pacific', 'left', 'islander', 'native', 'community', 'covid19', 'health', 'fend', 'alailima', 'nhpi', 'data', 'pandemic', 'islanders']",0
2020-12-15 00:51:43+00:00,3,"America has, finally, authorized a Covid-19 vaccine for the general public. Priority groups — health care workers and people in nursing homes — are now starting to get a vaccine. And if things go right, most of the country could be vaccinated by the end of next summer.

But that’s the caveat: if things go right. The development and authorization of a vaccine don’t mean that the US is guaranteed to get people inoculated quickly, or even that the country is on a certain path to conquer the coronavirus.

Experts caution, instead, that the country still faces two major challenges in its vaccination efforts.

First, the US has to manufacture and distribute a vaccine to more than 300 million people. As Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security senior scholar Crystal Watson told me, “This is going to be the largest mass vaccination campaign that the US has ever attempted.” It’s an effort so big, some experts have compared it to a New Deal. The logistical challenge isn’t just to produce all the vaccine doses required, it’s also shipping and storing them around the US at cold temperatures, and then administering them to people. If each person needs two doses (as is true for the vaccine authorized so far, although one-shot vaccines are in development), the difficulties are doubled.

But even if the US is able to pull off a feat of logistics, a second challenge looms: People will need to be persuaded to get a vaccine. That this will happen is not guaranteed. Polls suggest as many as half of Americans are resistant to getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Those hesitant people will need their concerns addressed, including worries about whether the quick development process sacrificed safety, what common side effects are expected, and what rare side effects may pop up. Doctors and public health officials will also have to communicate why it’s important for people to get a vaccine even if they don’t feel Covid-19 is a threat to them.

Experts caution that how the US deals with both these challenges could determine if Covid-19 remains a widespread problem by late 2021 or even 2022. It’s what will decide whether we get back to normal, and how many lives are saved — or unnecessarily lost — along the way.

On the first challenge, the US has done considerable work. Under Operation Warp Speed, the federal government has helped expedite research into the vaccines and committed to purchasing hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. Federal, state, and local governments now have plans, or are working on plans, for how to widely distribute a vaccine in the next several months.

But on the second challenge, experts say, the US is falling behind. When I asked if the country is prepared on the public opinion side for widespread Covid-19 vaccination, Texas State University medical anthropologist Emily Brunson told me, “No, we’re not.” So far, no real federal education and awareness campaign is underway. “It would have been ideal to begin months ago,” Brunson said.

The good news is that the US is now talking about these problems at all. Several months ago, experts warned a vaccine could take years to develop — and instead, some people are getting vaccinated in the same year that the Covid-19 pandemic took off. We can see a finish line much earlier than even some optimists were expecting.

The objective now is making sure we get through that finish line as quickly and safely as possible.

The first big challenge: Manufacturing and distributing a vaccine

Getting a vaccine out to more than 300 million Americans within months will be like nothing the US has done before. It will require enough raw materials to manufacture the doses and enough factories to produce them. Those doses will then need to be purchased and shipped to all 50 states. The states will then need to distribute the vaccines to different localities, which will have to distribute them at the local level based on need — all while keeping the vaccines safely stored at the right temperature. Health care and communication systems will need to be set up to prioritize people for the first shots and ensure everyone gets a second dose, which the current vaccines require, weeks later.

All of this will have to happen thousands to millions of times throughout the country in a matter of months.

Kendall Hoyt, a vaccine and biosecurity expert at Dartmouth, put this simply: “We need a lot of forward planning.” The White House, along with federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will need to coordinate and provide guidance for those efforts.

The task will also require a lot of resources — money — from the federal government. Local and state governments are cash-strapped from dealing with the ongoing economic downturn brought on by the pandemic. It’s not clear that the federal government is doing enough yet: Some officials say states need $8.4 billion to do this work; so far, they’ve gotten $340 million.

Transportation and storage could be particularly tricky for the current vaccines, which will require very cold temperatures to maintain their efficacy. That might require hospitals, pharmacies, and other storage facilities to buy new refrigerators and freezers, or prepare to administer the doses they have as quickly as possible, before they go bad. Particularly for more rural and smaller institutions, this could prove not just logistically difficult but very expensive — and they may only be able to do this with some sort of government support.

Another looming challenge is getting people to get their second dose of a vaccine. It’s well established in the medical literature that people are bad at follow-up appointments — with half of patients or more missing second doses for a similar hepatitis B vaccine regimen. While that might differ with a potentially lifesaving vaccine in the middle of a pandemic, local and health care agencies will need to be ready to aggressively follow up with people to get them to go back for a second dose.

Just as crucially, government and health care agencies will have to ensure those second doses actually are available to people. Without proper planning, supply could run out as people need to go back for their second doses.

These challenges could be especially magnified in historically underserved areas. One of the problems that has come up with coronavirus testing across the country is it can be much harder to get a test in low-income, minority areas. These also, however, are frequently the places hit hardest by Covid-19. Addressing these kinds of disparities — making vaccines available in neighborhoods where it might be harder for public health officials to reach people, or for people to get to the places the vaccines are distributed — will be a major challenge.

Different levels of government should also prepare for likely supply chain problems. These, too, popped up with testing, as testing collapsed in much of the country due to a shortage of vials, swabs, reagents, and other materials. The same thing could play out with vaccines, whether it’s the materials for doses, syringes, dry ice, storage equipment, or another thing entirely. The better prepared different places are, the quicker such problems can be fixed — and the less of a burden they could be on the whole supply chain.

“That is the kind of thing we should expect more and more,” Hoyt said. “There’s going to be a crush in demand. We’ve never had so much demand for needles, syringes, glass vials, and some key raw materials.”

The good news is there has been a lot of work done in this area. The federal government had plans in place to distribute the vaccine within 24 hours of authorization. Many states have already developed plans, and some are even running drills.

The question is whether this is all enough. Before the coronavirus, the US had plans in place for how to handle a pandemic, and officials and experts ran simulations to further prepare. But many of those plans and simulations were based on faulty assumptions — for instance, that the US would easily scale up testing nationally in response to a big outbreak. Infectious disease epidemiologist Saskia Popescu previously told me that in pandemic preparedness simulations she took part in before Covid-19, testing didn’t even come up as a possible problem. “We always assumed we would have widespread testing capabilities,” she said in the spring.

That assumption was disastrously wrong. The CDC initially botched its Covid-19 tests, causing delays in how quickly the process got started. Then, a lack of federal leadership led to preventable supply chain issues, a dearth of coordination across the country that left states fighting for limited supplies, and a failure to follow up on completed tests with adequate contact tracing programs. Months later, America’s testing and tracing capacities are still nowhere near where experts would like them to be.

Those kinds of problems could play out again with a vaccine.

The second big challenge: Persuading the public to take a vaccine

It’s not enough to make and distribute vaccines. “You can have a vaccine that … is fairly effective,” Brunson said. “But if no one takes them, that doesn’t matter.”

The biggest question of all is cost: If a vaccine is too expensive, people simply can’t and won’t get it. The federal government has laid out plans to try to ensure a vaccine is free for everyone, but it’s possible some people, particularly the uninsured or underinsured, could fall through the cracks.

Even if a vaccine is free for everyone, though, there are still other problems.

Polls show a considerable number of Americans — as many as half, based on a previous study by Gallup — may be reluctant or refuse to get the vaccine. That already seems to be changing as preliminary studies suggest the vaccines are very effective: A Pew Research Center survey found 60 percent of Americans said they would get a vaccine in November, up from 51 percent in September. But that’s still a lot of Americans who are at least skeptical.

Experts caution that this skepticism should not be treated as conspiracy theorizing or typical anti-vaxxer sentiments. There are more understandable reasons for some of the current vaccine skepticism — from the fact it’s a vaccine for a new virus to the incredibly quick process behind the vaccines to the massive amount of political polarization that’s overtaken all things Covid-19.

So simply trying to shame people into getting a vaccine isn’t going to work. The public will need to be persuaded — convinced that, as the clinical trials have demonstrated so far, the vaccines are safe and effective.

That will require transparency, acknowledging not just the benefits of the vaccine but also the possible side effects. With the Covid-19 vaccines, some people can expect to get ill in the hours after a dose — nothing life-threatening or dangerous, but symptoms like fatigue, headaches, chills, and muscle pain have been reported. It’s important, experts said, for officials and health care workers to communicate the symptoms are normal, temporary, a sign that the vaccine is actually working, and worth the benefits of avoiding a much more dangerous illness.

There are also more specific concerns for certain demographics that will need answers. Young people may feel like they don’t need the vaccine because they’re at lower risk for Covid-19, but it should be clearly explained to them that young, seemingly healthy people have gotten sick too — one of the worst things about the coronavirus is its effects can be so unexpected. People of color, especially Black Americans, distrust a health care system that frequently discriminates against them and used them for experiments in the past without their consent; those concerns should be taken seriously, while noting a vaccine has been vetted in clinical trials and will save lives.

Then there’s the political divide to overcome. Based on public opinion surveys, Democrats appear more likely to get a vaccine than their Republican counterparts. It will be on Republican leaders, like President Donald Trump and former President George W. Bush (who has already said he’ll get vaccinated publicly) to persuade people that a vaccine is truly safe and effective.

The public also has to be prepared for the unknown. There’s a chance, however small, that the vaccine could produce a rare side effect — people need to be told why that might be an acceptable risk if it’s truly rare, given the massive damage Covid-19 is inflicting on society as a whole. People will also experience health issues completely unrelated to the vaccine after they get vaccinated — that’s natural as hundreds of millions of people get vaccinated — and some may incorrectly link such issues to the vaccine; officials will need to be ready for that, too.

“In the normal course, people will get sick and die from a variety of things, many of which will now be attributed to the vaccine,” Hoyt said. “There needs to be a lot of forward communication about the baseline incidence of various ailments so people don’t rush to judgment. We can expect that people still will, but we need to develop a game plan to respond to that.”

At the same time, it’s important to not make people too confident. There are still questions we don’t know the answers to. Do Covid-19 vaccines actually stop transmission, meaning people can stop masking and distancing relatively quickly, or does it only stop people from getting sick, which will require precautions for longer? Are vaccines’ effects long-lasting, or will people need boosters to refresh their immunity? People need to be told these are major unknowns that should influence post-vaccine lifestyle changes, at least in the short term.

The government could do many things to push people to get a vaccine. It could ensure a vaccine is free. It could do a large, national public education campaign. It could even pay people to take a vaccine, or try to mandate vaccination (though that would raise legal and ethical questions that could further polarize the issue).

But besides federal plans to make Covid-19 vaccines free, there hasn’t been much movement in these areas. “There’s been no promotional campaign at all,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me.

Right now, America can finally see an end to its Covid-19 outbreak. The first task is social distancing and masking to make sure more people make it to the point where they can get vaccinated. But then we need to make sure people actually can and want to get a Covid-19 vaccine.

It’s not clear that the country is up to those challenges.

“If we do [vaccination] right, it can be positive and have long-term implications for public health generally,” Brunson said. “But the opposite is also true: If this is done badly, you run the risk of undermining public trust in your entire public health system.”",voxdotcom,"['big', 'public', 'federal', 'country', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'need', 'second', 'challenges', 'vaccines']",0

2020-12-14 19:05:02+00:00,10,"On Monday morning, the first person in the United States received a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. Now images of Sandra Lindsay, a nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, are going viral. But over the coming weeks and months, she’ll be far from the only person showing up in social media feeds getting inoculated.

At the dawn of the pandemic, celebrities and influencers flooded our feeds with content urging us to take preventive measures, like hand-washing, social distancing, and mask-wearing. That wasn’t a coincidence: Public health leaders and campaigns strategically encouraged and recruited those with large online followings to use their platforms for good.

Now the groundwork is being laid for the same thing to happen again — except this time, the mission is to convince as many people as possible to get a Covid-19 vaccine.

Recent polling shows that the number of Americans willing to get the vaccine, and to do so as soon as it becomes available, oscillates. An ABC News/Ipsos poll found that more than 80 percent are willing to get the vaccine, but just 40 percent will do so as soon as they can. Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of people would probably or definitely get the vaccine in an early December survey.

That’s a significant jump from the 50 percent who said they would be willing to take a vaccine in September — but it still means millions are hesitant about getting vaccinated. For the vaccine to have a large-scale impact, people don’t just need to be willing to be inoculated; they have to be enthusiastic enough to seek it out (and possibly twice, if they’re getting the Pfizer vaccine, which requires a booster shot).

The global campaign to encourage Covid-19 vaccination will be unprecedented, and many institutions will have a role, including government and public health authorities. But some, including the World Health Organization, the Ad Council, and the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, are already laying the groundwork for influencers and celebrities to have a hand in the process.

They say influencers could help promote positive, accurate vaccine content to a wide audience, as well as target content to individual communities. But there’s also concern the campaign could backfire: One person’s trusted celebrity is another’s red herring. And influencers and celebrities that encourage their fans to get inoculated will inevitably be jumping into frequently tense online discourse surrounding vaccines and exposing themselves to misinformation and online attacks from the anti-vaccine movement.

Still, these campaigns are already in the works. In the United Kingdom, where the Pfizer vaccine was rolled out in early December, the National Health Service is planning to get celebrities to encourage people to take the vaccine, with soccer player Marcus Rashford and members of the British royal family identified as optimal candidates, the Guardian reported.

“Influencers can be very helpful in spreading awareness about benefits of vaccines and advocating for vaccine acceptance,” Tarik Jašarević, a spokesperson for the WHO, told Recode, in an email. “WHO is working on a comprehensive campaign on immunization and Covid-19 vaccines for 2021.” The organization added that the value of recruiting influencers depends on the audience, and that it’s not always influencers with a huge online following that have the most value.

In the US, there are many efforts meant to involve celebrities and influencers in rolling out Covid-19 vaccination. The Ad Council — which famously created the wildfire prevention campaign of Smokey Bear and the 1990s AIDS prevention campaign encouraging safe sex — is putting together a $50 million campaign that will rely in part on influencers to encourage people to take the vaccine. Some have even floated the idea of offering athletes and a subset of rich and famous people the vaccine early in a bid to boost confidence. Some politicians, including former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, have already said they’ll take the vaccine publicly. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has volunteered to do so on camera.

In fact, the Trump administration had planned a Covid-19 public awareness campaign on celebrities earlier this year. The federal government planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a broad marketing effort that would enlist celebrities like Dennis Quaid and Billy Ray Cyrus to counter sadness triggered by the pandemic and boost excitement for the vaccine. The plan fell apart amid Democrats’ concern that the ploy was actually designed to boost Trump’s reelection chances. Now the Department of Health and Human Services is moving quickly to develop a new outreach campaign focused on the vaccine on a somewhat rushed schedule. A spokesperson for HHS told Recode the original plan to use celebrities has been put aside, making the influencer- and celebrity-based campaigns being developed outside the government perhaps even more important.

The virtue of recruiting influencers for this marketing effort is that not everyone cares — or is even paying attention to — what Fauci or other US public health authorities have to say about the vaccine. And even for those who are, repetition of that message can make getting a Covid-19 vaccine become a social norm more quickly, especially in an environment where people’s faith in official public health sources is strained, according to Sherry Pagoto, a professor who directs the University of Connecticut's Center for Health and Social Media.

“To the extent that we can leverage other trusted and influential sources to get the word out, I think we’ll have better luck at getting people to feel comfortable and have confidence in the vaccine,” Pagoto told Recode.

Why influencers could help combat vaccine hesitancy

That celebrities and influencers would have a role in promoting a Covid-19 vaccine isn’t surprising. Elvis Presley famously took the polio vaccine on The Ed Sullivan Show in order to encourage other young people to do the same. And celebrities have made a significant impact on public health communications in the past. Some researchers have found, for instance, that Angelina Jolie’s 2013 op-ed about getting a preventive double mastectomy might have boosted genetic testing that could indicate future breast cancer.

Throughout the pandemic, a number of influencers have stepped up to encourage coronavirus safety measures. TikTok star Charlie D’Amelio made a social distancing-inspired dance go viral. Kim Kardashian West arranged a private Zoom call with dozens of celebrities and Fauci to ask questions that could inform how they spoke to their own followers. Some social media influencers have even been brought on to promote flu vaccines.

US Surgeon General Jerome Adams directly called on celebrities like Kylie Jenner to encourage people to take the pandemic guidelines from health professionals seriously (the reality television and cosmetics industry entrepreneur obliged in an Instagram Story sent to her 166 million followers). Actor Harrison Ford also encouraged Americans to participate in Covid-19 vaccine trials in a public service announcement.

The next phase of the Covid-19 outbreak will require sharing accurate information about vaccinations, a task that will need to be tailored to different communities. The distribution for the vaccine will be in phases based on who is most at risk, meaning that young people without preexisting conditions are likely last in line.

“We know for sure that a one-size-fits-all message will not be the solution to such a complex challenge,” said Michelle Hillman, the Ad Council’s chief campaign development officer. “We also know that a patchwork approach won’t work.”

Influencers will be part of the Ad Council’s effort. Over the coming weeks and months, the nonprofit is laying the groundwork for a $50 million campaign to encourage Covid-19 vaccination, which the organization thinks could be one of the largest public education efforts ever run in the US. The idea is to use trusted people with large online followings to discuss vaccine safety and address misinformation.

Even though it will likely be some time before a vaccine is widely available, Hillman said the work for finding the right voices and messaging to counteract vaccine hesitancy needs to begin now.

The Ad Council is taking an approach that involves influencers, in part because it wants to tailor messaging to particular communities. The organization will even use artificial intelligence from IBM Watson to study and predict what kind of content does best with different audiences. The campaign will pay particular attention to Latinx and Black communities, in which reluctance toward taking a Covid-19 vaccine can be higher due to distrust in the government, existing health inequities, and a history of systemic racism in the US health care system.

This approach is similar to the Ad Council’s #MaskUpAmerica campaign, which encouraged mask-wearing in the pandemic. So far, the nonprofit’s Covid-19 efforts have involved more than 120 influencers and celebrities who have pushed pro-mask content on a variety of platforms, including Twitch and TikTok.

But the Ad Council isn’t alone in its focus on influencers. When a vaccine becomes widely available, Qianna Smith Bruneteau, the founder and executive director of the American Influencer Council, is planning to encourage influencers to share information about getting vaccinated. The council, which operates as a nonprofit trade organization, has already created an online resource center. In addition, Bruneteau and Patrick Janelle, the council’s chair and an Instagram influencer with more than 400,000 followers on Instagram, both plan to livestream their vaccinations on the platform.

That lots of influencers will play a role in promoting getting vaccinated against Covid-19 seems inevitable, according to Tyler Farnsworth, the chief growth officer and founder of the influencer marketing agency August United. In some sense, the effort will build on influencer marketing campaigns that Farnsworth’s company has already worked on during the pandemic, like hand-washing content produced with a soap company.

“The groundwork has already been laid for it,” Farnsworth said. “There is at least one state that we are actively working together with [...] on putting together a plan to activate influencers across their state to encourage the use of the vaccine. I believe many more will follow.” He added that, in the past year, influencers have become more open to potentially contentious content, like political advocacy, which could make them more willing to speak about the Covid-19 vaccine.

Influencers will expose themselves to misinformation — or spread it themselves

Vaccine misinformation is showing up on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, so anti-vaccination content, and even Covid-19 conspiracy theories, will certainly impact the work that influencers can do to promote a vaccine. Earlier in the pandemic, some celebrities and political activists, including actor Woody Harrelson and the commentator duo Diamond and Silk, spread conspiracy theories about Covid-19, and there’s no sign that trend will stop when a vaccine candidate is authorized in the US. Now some see a role for influencers in counteracting such messaging.

Recently, conservative commentator Candace Owens posted a video on Instagram raising skepticism about the need for a Covid-19 vaccine, and implied that people who take the vaccine are “sheep.” The video was flagged by Facebook’s fact-checking system but was still viewed nearly 2 million times. Other longstanding anti-vaccine voices, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have remained active on social media, and they’re increasingly focusing on sowing skepticism in Covid-19 vaccine candidates.

Before the emergency use authorization arrived, Facebook and YouTube started to adjust their policies on Covid-19 vaccine misinformation, such as banning vaccine conspiracy theories and content that contradicts the recommendation of public health authorities. But these changes don’t mean content that’s skeptical toward such vaccines is always removed.

Public health experts have also emphasized that people are going to have worries about a new vaccine, and should have space online to ask questions and share their concerns. Those fears could be exacerbated by blatantly wrong misinformation.

“We are dealing with so many people having doubts about the vaccine,” said Bruneteau of the American Influencer Council. “Creators can 100 percent help combat Covid-19 vaccination misinformation.”

Influencers — smaller, more focused accounts than celebrities with tens of millions of followers — rely on clients to pay them to promote certain products. That means some influencers don’t always want to post content they fear could be controversial, like politics, or even information about vaccines.

“Every time I post about vaccines in general, I get just in droves people coming and attacking my page,” Danielle Jones, an OB-GYN who has more than half a million subscribers on her YouTube page, told Recode. “At one point in the past couple of years, I actually had to make my Instagram private, because people had gone over and just started commenting that my kids were vaccine-injured.”

She added that attacks from anti-vax accounts will discourage some people from posting about Covid-19 vaccines. Still, she says she feels a duty to share the right information.

Encouraging vaccine uptake will be a delicate task

There’s no single entity responsible for encouraging vaccination. As a result, it seems like many groups — including social media companies, the White House, public health experts, and even influencers — need to be involved.

“The hard part [is] that there’s so many players who need to be at the table, and they’re all so critical that any one of them missing would possibly lead this to not work,” said Carly Goldstein, a Brown University psychiatry and human behavior professor who has written about potential Covid-19 vaccine influencers.

Careful calibration is important, experts told Recode, because missteps could lead to a campaign backfiring. A government agency bringing along celebrities could actually decrease people’s trust in the government’s abilities, notes Alessia Grassi, a lecturer at the University of Huddersfield. Even if a particular celebrity did manage to convince their audience, their endorsement could potentially turn off another audience.

A guide to Covid-19 vaccine communication produced at the University of Florida, in partnership with the United Nations’ anti-misinformation campaign, has urged public health leaders to choose the right “messengers.” That initiative found that celebrities on their own are not trusted sources of Covid-19 information.

That might indicate that influencers themselves shouldn’t get too into the scientific weeds, and should instead play a role in diverting people toward public health sources. It might also mean looking more toward influencers with a health care background. In fact, the public could likely benefit from the surge in the number of nurse and doctor influencers seen in 2019 and 2020, according to Joe Gagliese, the CEO of the influencer agency Viral Nation, which worked with the WHO to provide accurate information to influencers earlier in the pandemic.

“What you’ll see is there’s a ton of influencers that are in the health care space, and they’ll generally lean toward whatever the consensus is in the medical field,” Gagliese told Recode.

In fact, some of these influencers are already starting. Some physicians have posted TikToks explaining how mRNA works, which is foundational to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. Others, like Jones, the OB-GYN, have offered guidance on what the vaccine might mean for pregnant people. And then there are the physicians who are just sharing their excitement about the prospect of inoculation.

“I cannot wait to get the vaccine, because I know it can protect me, and it can protect those around me that I care about,” Jennifer Arnold, a doctor with preexisting conditions who stars in the TLC show The Little Couple and has nearly a million followers on Instagram, said.

“I get excited when I am able to have any type of influence,” she added. “If I can help one other person to decide to get the vaccine and ultimately save a life through social media, that is phenomenal.”

The rollout comes after the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Friday evening. The authorization followed a recommendation from a vaccine advisory committee after reviewing clinical trial data showing that the vaccine was 95 percent effective at preventing disease in people 16 years old and older. The US emergency authorization follows similar clearances in Canada and the United Kingdom last week.

And not a moment too soon: The US is reaching horrific new levels of Covid-19 hospitalizations, with many ICUs around the country overwhelmed. Meanwhile, daily fatality numbers keep climbing, with close to 300,000 total reported deaths in the US since the pandemic started.

The launch of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine marks the fastest development effort for a vaccine in history, an endeavor that typically spans decades. In addition, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine uses mRNA as its platform, a new technology that has never seen widespread use in humans before.

“In my lifetime, biomedical science has never moved this fast,” said E. John Wherry, director of the Institute of Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania, during a Monday webinar about Covid-19 vaccines. “This would have been absolutely unfathomable just a few years ago that we would move this fast.”

While health care workers and people in long-term care facilities are at the front of the line, these groups add up to about 24 million people, so the first round of vaccine shipments will not be enough for everyone. Some hospital systems are using algorithms to weigh risk factors; others are using lotteries to determine who will be among the first to receive the inoculation.

Operation Warp Speed, the program from the Department of Health and Human Services, is aiming to have enough Covid-19 vaccines to immunize 20 million Americans in December, 30 million more in January, and 50 million more in February as more vaccines gain approval.

Another challenge is that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has stringent cold storage requirements, demanding temperatures of -70°C (-94°F) or lower. While Pfizer says it has developed shipping containers that can safely store the vaccine at the requisite temperatures for up to 10 days, longer storage will require specialized ultra-cold freezers that are only available at a handful of medical facilities, and those places have limited storage space. That means timing the shipments of the vaccine will be critical.

The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee is meeting on Thursday to consider another mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine, this one developed by Moderna. This vaccine also demonstrated 95 percent efficacy.

2020-12-14 15:54:17+00:00,6,"For December 12’s Saturday Night Live cold open, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, played by Beck Bennett, addressed the topic on everyone’s minds: The recently authorized Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.

Bennett’s Blitzer — who introduced himself as “an indoor man with an outdoor name” — opened the show with news of the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccine before introducing White House coronavirus task force members Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx.

“It’s just like the PS5,” Bennett quipped of the vaccine. “Everybody wants it, nobody can get it, and if you’re rich, you already had it a month ago.”

Fauci — played this time by SNL’s Kate McKinnon rather than by Brad Pitt — confirmed the good news for Blitzer and announced his decision to join the Biden administration as a chief medical adviser in addition to his current role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

“And I think I’ll be joining as well,” Heidi Gardner’s Birx, whose real-world position in the Biden administration is less certain, chimed in. “Remember when Trump said to inject bleach ... and I almost whispered, ‘No’?”

Bennett pressed the pair — who he dubbed “the American Gothic of the whole coronavirus situation” — on vaccine logistics, distribution priorities, and more.

“We’re doing this vaccine World War II-style,” McKinnon said as Fauci. “We made England” — which began vaccinations on Tuesday — “go in first, see what’s what, and then we swoop in at the end and steal the spotlight.”

McKinnon also gave poor marks to the federal vaccine plan, telling Bennett that “this president has done about as good a job with this rollout as I did throwing out that first pitch at the Nationals game.”

In July, a Fauci first pitch went badly askew — which he said at the time was because he spent too long practicing before throwing out the pitch.

Dr. Anthony Fauci threw out the first pitch before the Nationals-Yankees game. pic.twitter.com/04Tbkh7Voa — ESPN (@espn) July 23, 2020

After Bennett aired a clip of the real-world Fauci’s pitch, Gardner tried to cheer McKinnon up.

“It’s okay, little guy,” she said. “We all mess up sometime. You threw the ball wrong, I didn’t say, ‘Don’t drink the bleach.’ It happens!”

Throughout the skit, McKinnon was also barraged with thrown bras, a phenomenon which she explained as common because “throughout this whole thing I’ve been the only one saying facts, so some people got a crush on me.”

And the pair offered a variety of regionally tailored vaccine distribution strategies.

“In New Orleans we’re tossing the vaccines up to balconies like Mardi Gras beads,” McKinnon said, and Gardner told Bennett that “North Carolina’s vaccine will be vinegar-based, while South Carolina’s will be mustard-based.”

(There’s a longstanding schism between the Carolinas when it comes to vinegar- and mustard-based BBQ sauces.)

New York, meanwhile, will get vaccine vials that are “very thin on the bottom,” in contrast to Chicago’s “deep dish” vials.

2020-12-14 13:00:22+00:00,4,"America has, finally, authorized a Covid-19 vaccine for the general public. Priority groups — health care workers and people in nursing homes — are now starting to get a vaccine. And if things go right, most of the country could be vaccinated by the end of next summer.

But that’s the caveat: if things go right. The development and authorization of a vaccine don’t mean that the US is guaranteed to get people inoculated quickly, or even that the country is on a certain path to conquer the coronavirus.

Experts caution, instead, that the country still faces two major challenges in its vaccination efforts.

First, the US has to manufacture and distribute a vaccine to more than 300 million people. As Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security senior scholar Crystal Watson told me, “This is going to be the largest mass vaccination campaign that the US has ever attempted.” It’s an effort so big, some experts have compared it to a New Deal. The logistical challenge isn’t just to produce all the vaccine doses required, it’s also shipping and storing them around the US at cold temperatures, and then administering them to people. If each person needs two doses (as is true for the vaccine authorized so far, although one-shot vaccines are in development), the difficulties are doubled.

But even if the US is able to pull off a feat of logistics, a second challenge looms: People will need to be persuaded to get a vaccine. That this will happen is not guaranteed. Polls suggest as many as half of Americans are resistant to getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Those hesitant people will need their concerns addressed, including worries about whether the quick development process sacrificed safety, what common side effects are expected, and what rare side effects may pop up. Doctors and public health officials will also have to communicate why it’s important for people to get a vaccine even if they don’t feel Covid-19 is a threat to them.

Experts caution that how the US deals with both these challenges could determine if Covid-19 remains a widespread problem by late 2021 or even 2022. It’s what will decide whether we get back to normal, and how many lives are saved — or unnecessarily lost — along the way.

On the first challenge, the US has done considerable work. Under Operation Warp Speed, the federal government has helped expedite research into the vaccines and committed to purchasing hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. Federal, state, and local governments now have plans, or are working on plans, for how to widely distribute a vaccine in the next several months.

But on the second challenge, experts say, the US is falling behind. When I asked if the country is prepared on the public opinion side for widespread Covid-19 vaccination, Texas State University medical anthropologist Emily Brunson told me, “No, we’re not.” So far, no real federal education and awareness campaign is underway. “It would have been ideal to begin months ago,” Brunson said.

The good news is that the US is now talking about these problems at all. Several months ago, experts warned a vaccine could take years to develop — and instead, some people are getting vaccinated in the same year that the Covid-19 pandemic took off. We can see a finish line much earlier than even some optimists were expecting.

The objective now is making sure we get through that finish line as quickly and safely as possible.

The first big challenge: Manufacturing and distributing a vaccine

Getting a vaccine out to more than 300 million Americans within months will be like nothing the US has done before. It will require enough raw materials to manufacture the doses and enough factories to produce them. Those doses will then need to be purchased and shipped to all 50 states. The states will then need to distribute the vaccines to different localities, which will have to distribute them at the local level based on need — all while keeping the vaccines safely stored at the right temperature. Health care and communication systems will need to be set up to prioritize people for the first shots and ensure everyone gets a second dose, which the current vaccines require, weeks later.

All of this will have to happen thousands to millions of times throughout the country in a matter of months.

Kendall Hoyt, a vaccine and biosecurity expert at Dartmouth, put this simply: “We need a lot of forward planning.” The White House, along with federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will need to coordinate and provide guidance for those efforts.

The task will also require a lot of resources — money — from the federal government. Local and state governments are cash-strapped from dealing with the ongoing economic downturn brought on by the pandemic. It’s not clear that the federal government is doing enough yet: Some officials say states need $8.4 billion to do this work; so far, they’ve gotten $340 million.

Transportation and storage could be particularly tricky for the current vaccines, which will require very cold temperatures to maintain their efficacy. That might require hospitals, pharmacies, and other storage facilities to buy new refrigerators and freezers, or prepare to administer the doses they have as quickly as possible, before they go bad. Particularly for more rural and smaller institutions, this could prove not just logistically difficult but very expensive — and they may only be able to do this with some sort of government support.

Another looming challenge is getting people to get their second dose of a vaccine. It’s well established in the medical literature that people are bad at follow-up appointments — with half of patients or more missing second doses for a similar hepatitis B vaccine regimen. While that might differ with a potentially lifesaving vaccine in the middle of a pandemic, local and health care agencies will need to be ready to aggressively follow up with people to get them to go back for a second dose.

Just as crucially, government and health care agencies will have to ensure those second doses actually are available to people. Without proper planning, supply could run out as people need to go back for their second doses.

These challenges could be especially magnified in historically underserved areas. One of the problems that has come up with coronavirus testing across the country is it can be much harder to get a test in low-income, minority areas. These also, however, are frequently the places hit hardest by Covid-19. Addressing these kinds of disparities — making vaccines available in neighborhoods where it might be harder for public health officials to reach people, or for people to get to the places the vaccines are distributed — will be a major challenge.

Different levels of government should also prepare for likely supply chain problems. These, too, popped up with testing, as testing collapsed in much of the country due to a shortage of vials, swabs, reagents, and other materials. The same thing could play out with vaccines, whether it’s the materials for doses, syringes, dry ice, storage equipment, or another thing entirely. The better prepared different places are, the quicker such problems can be fixed — and the less of a burden they could be on the whole supply chain.

“That is the kind of thing we should expect more and more,” Hoyt said. “There’s going to be a crush in demand. We’ve never had so much demand for needles, syringes, glass vials, and some key raw materials.”

The good news is there has been a lot of work done in this area. The federal government had plans in place to distribute the vaccine within 24 hours of authorization. Many states have already developed plans, and some are even running drills.

The question is whether this is all enough. Before the coronavirus, the US had plans in place for how to handle a pandemic, and officials and experts ran simulations to further prepare. But many of those plans and simulations were based on faulty assumptions — for instance, that the US would easily scale up testing nationally in response to a big outbreak. Infectious disease epidemiologist Saskia Popescu previously told me that in pandemic preparedness simulations she took part in before Covid-19, testing didn’t even come up as a possible problem. “We always assumed we would have widespread testing capabilities,” she said in the spring.

That assumption was disastrously wrong. The CDC initially botched its Covid-19 tests, causing delays in how quickly the process got started. Then, a lack of federal leadership led to preventable supply chain issues, a dearth of coordination across the country that left states fighting for limited supplies, and a failure to follow up on completed tests with adequate contact tracing programs. Months later, America’s testing and tracing capacities are still nowhere near where experts would like them to be.

Those kinds of problems could play out again with a vaccine.

The second big challenge: Persuading the public to take a vaccine

It’s not enough to make and distribute vaccines. “You can have a vaccine that … is fairly effective,” Brunson said. “But if no one takes them, that doesn’t matter.”

The biggest question of all is cost: If a vaccine is too expensive, people simply can’t and won’t get it. The federal government has laid out plans to try to ensure a vaccine is free for everyone, but it’s possible some people, particularly the uninsured or underinsured, could fall through the cracks.

Even if a vaccine is free for everyone, though, there are still other problems.

Polls show a considerable number of Americans — as many as half, based on a previous study by Gallup — may be reluctant or refuse to get the vaccine. That already seems to be changing as preliminary studies suggest the vaccines are very effective: A Pew Research Center survey found 60 percent of Americans said they would get a vaccine in November, up from 51 percent in September. But that’s still a lot of Americans who are at least skeptical.

Experts caution that this skepticism should not be treated as conspiracy theorizing or typical anti-vaxxer sentiments. There are more understandable reasons for some of the current vaccine skepticism — from the fact it’s a vaccine for a new virus to the incredibly quick process behind the vaccines to the massive amount of political polarization that’s overtaken all things Covid-19.

So simply trying to shame people into getting a vaccine isn’t going to work. The public will need to be persuaded — convinced that, as the clinical trials have demonstrated so far, the vaccines are safe and effective.

That will require transparency, acknowledging not just the benefits of the vaccine but also the possible side effects. With the Covid-19 vaccines, some people can expect to get ill in the hours after a dose — nothing life-threatening or dangerous, but symptoms like fatigue, headaches, chills, and muscle pain have been reported. It’s important, experts said, for officials and health care workers to communicate the symptoms are normal, temporary, a sign that the vaccine is actually working, and worth the benefits of avoiding a much more dangerous illness.

There are also more specific concerns for certain demographics that will need answers. Young people may feel like they don’t need the vaccine because they’re at lower risk for Covid-19, but it should be clearly explained to them that young, seemingly healthy people have gotten sick too — one of the worst things about the coronavirus is its effects can be so unexpected. People of color, especially Black Americans, distrust a health care system that frequently discriminates against them and used them for experiments in the past without their consent; those concerns should be taken seriously, while noting a vaccine has been vetted in clinical trials and will save lives.

Then there’s the political divide to overcome. Based on public opinion surveys, Democrats appear more likely to get a vaccine than their Republican counterparts. It will be on Republican leaders, like President Donald Trump and former President George W. Bush (who has already said he’ll get vaccinated publicly) to persuade people that a vaccine is truly safe and effective.

The public also has to be prepared for the unknown. There’s a chance, however small, that the vaccine could produce a rare side effect — people need to be told why that might be an acceptable risk if it’s truly rare, given the massive damage Covid-19 is inflicting on society as a whole. People will also experience health issues completely unrelated to the vaccine after they get vaccinated — that’s natural as hundreds of millions of people get vaccinated — and some may incorrectly link such issues to the vaccine; officials will need to be ready for that, too.

“In the normal course, people will get sick and die from a variety of things, many of which will now be attributed to the vaccine,” Hoyt said. “There needs to be a lot of forward communication about the baseline incidence of various ailments so people don’t rush to judgment. We can expect that people still will, but we need to develop a game plan to respond to that.”

At the same time, it’s important to not make people too confident. There are still questions we don’t know the answers to. Do Covid-19 vaccines actually stop transmission, meaning people can stop masking and distancing relatively quickly, or does it only stop people from getting sick, which will require precautions for longer? Are vaccines’ effects long-lasting, or will people need boosters to refresh their immunity? People need to be told these are major unknowns that should influence post-vaccine lifestyle changes, at least in the short term.

The government could do many things to push people to get a vaccine. It could ensure a vaccine is free. It could do a large, national public education campaign. It could even pay people to take a vaccine, or try to mandate vaccination (though that would raise legal and ethical questions that could further polarize the issue).

But besides federal plans to make Covid-19 vaccines free, there hasn’t been much movement in these areas. “There’s been no promotional campaign at all,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me.

Right now, America can finally see an end to its Covid-19 outbreak. The first task is social distancing and masking to make sure more people make it to the point where they can get vaccinated. But then we need to make sure people actually can and want to get a Covid-19 vaccine.

It’s not clear that the country is up to those challenges.

“If we do [vaccination] right, it can be positive and have long-term implications for public health generally,” Brunson said. “But the opposite is also true: If this is done badly, you run the risk of undermining public trust in your entire public health system.”",voxdotcom,"['big', 'public', 'federal', 'country', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'need', 'second', 'challenges', 'vaccines']",0

2020-12-12 14:47:45+00:00,6,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday evening granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, making it the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States to begin distribution outside of clinical trials.

The first 6.4 million doses could ship within days.

The announcement came after an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, voted 17 to 4, with 1 abstention, to recommend and EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The committee specifically voted on whether the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks in people aged 16 years and older.

The highly anticipated regulatory green light means health workers facing high exposure to the disease and residents of long-term care facilities can now start receiving the first doses of the two-dose vaccine.

That a vaccine for a disease only discovered late last year would be ready so quickly is already an unmatched scientific feat, but the fact that it’s also based on a new technology that yielded 95 percent efficacy in preventing disease makes the announcement all the more remarkable.

“The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a statement.

The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US follows green lights from regulatory agencies in Canada and the United Kingdom. Next week, the vaccine advisory committee will consider another EUA for the Covid-19 vaccine using a similar approach developed by Moderna.

But an EUA is only one step forward.

The vaccine must then be shipped to health facilities and administered in two doses. These steps present their own challenges, ranging from keeping the vaccine at the frigid temperatures it requires to getting patients to come back for a follow-up shot. Meanwhile, many of the health systems administering shots are struggling to care for a huge surge of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

This rollout will be part of the largest vaccination effort in history. But there will not be enough doses for everyone at the outset, even for people placed at the front of the line. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine around the world before the end of the year, enough for 25 million people — half of which has been pledged for the US. The first doses to roll out will be a crucial test of the vaccine distribution system in the United States, as well as a test of public acceptance and of the integrity of the clinical trial process.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is cleared for emergency approval. Now what?

One of the first challenges for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is getting it where it needs to go. That’s complicated by the fact that the vaccine requires temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, some of the coldest temperature constraints of any Covid-19 vaccine under development. Maintaining the cold chain from factories to distribution hubs to hospitals is crucial; otherwise, the vaccine may spoil and become ineffective.

Pfizer has developed its own temperature-controlled shipping containers that use dry ice to maintain the recommended temperatures for their vaccine for up to 10 days. But longer storage will require ultra-cold freezers, and not many clinics have the requisite hardware, so timing the shipments will be key. There may also be shortages of dry ice.

The next hurdle is figuring out who gets the vaccine first. The 6.4 million doses available at the outset are nowhere near enough to quench the raging Covid-19 pandemic that is still reaching new peaks in daily hospitalizations and fatalities.

An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted at the beginning of this month on a set of guidelines that prioritize health care personnel, as well as staff and residents of long-term care facilities. But these groups alone add up to about 24 million people, so states and local governments and health groups are having to narrow these groups further.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine also has to be administered as two doses spaced 21 days apart. That poses a problem because experiences with other vaccines show that people are really bad at getting follow-up shots. As many as half of patients failed to get their second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, for example. For the Covid-19 vaccine, side effects from the first dose, scheduling conflicts, or supply shortages may inhibit recipients from getting the second dose.

The good news is that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may offer some protection against Covid-19 from the first dose, although it takes a few days for the shielding to build up. In fact, some experts, including former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, argued that the entire allotment of doses should be given to as many people as possible, as fast as possible, rather than withholding injections to give to people as second shots.

“We should get as many shots in our arms as possible right away,” he told USA Today on Monday. “The idea that we need to cut (the doses) in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the second dose … I just fundamentally disagree with that.”

But other experts say there isn’t yet enough data on a single dose to know whether it will provide enough protection from the virus for the broader population.

Meanwhile, the FDA is likely to authorize another Covid-19 vaccine in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the distribution of 25 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough for 12.5 million people on the two-dose regimen.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, the program from the Department of Health and Human Services to accelerate and deploy Covid-19 vaccines, said he expects 20 million Americans will be vaccinated in December, 30 million more in January, and 50 million more in February as more vaccines with promising early results are approved.

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines must continue, but they’re going to get harder to complete as placebo participants leave to get vaccinated

An EUA is a critical step, but it’s not full approval, and it signals that the FDA still wants answers to key questions, like long-term safety. The standards for an EUA for a vaccine is that there is an urgent public health need, the proposed vaccine may have a beneficial effect, and that there are no approved alternatives. The FDA also set a minimum threshold of 50 percent efficacy for a Covid-19 vaccine, a line that several vaccines have completely vaulted.

So far, Pfizer and BioNTech are only reporting two months of observational safety for their phase 3 clinical trial, although the companies have committed to continue monitoring their more than 43,000 trial participants.

But at the same time, Covid-19 is spreading rampantly in the United States, and more than 20,000 people in Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial have received a placebo rather than the actual vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the disease. Of the 178 reported cases of Covid-19 in the trial pool, 169 were in the placebo group. Of those, 9 in the placebo group and 1 in the vaccine group experienced severe Covid-19. As time goes on, more people in the placebo group will likely get sick and some will fall severely ill, requiring hospitalization. Without intervention, some of these people in the placebo group may die.

The EUA now presents a huge dilemma for the clinical trial. People in the placebo group may be at risk of Covid-19, but if they receive the vaccine, it would diminish the value of the trial and make it harder to answer questions about safety and efficacy, particularly in vulnerable subgroups like older adults.

And since this is a double-blind clinical trial, neither the recipients nor the companies know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. Vaccinating the placebo group would require breaking this blind, and if participants find out which group they’re in, they could change their behavior. People who received the vaccine may engage in riskier behavior while people in the placebo group may end up taking more precautions if they decide not to get vaccinated themselves. Those changes in behavior will make it harder to isolate the effects of the vaccine.

William C. Gruber, senior vice president for vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, told the FDA vaccine advisory committee on Thursday that the company has an ethical obligation to inform trial participants that the vaccine has received an EUA, but they are working on coming up with ways to maintain the integrity of the trial as much as possible.

“Eligible participants in the placebo group will have the option to receive the vaccine,” Gruber said. “We are currently in discussions with the FDA about the best way to vaccinate placebo recipients.”

Gruber added that the study will continue for 24 months regardless, with ongoing monitoring of the trial participants. This sort of large-scale and long-term follow-up is key because there may be rare complications that emerge that weren’t detected over a shorter time frame or were not present in the selected pool of participants in the trial.

Already, the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK has revealed that people with severe allergies could face complications.

“[T]he expectation would be that subjects with known severe reaction — allergic reaction — should not take the vaccine until we understand exactly what happened here,” Slaoui told reporters on Wednesday.

More people receiving this inoculation will further clarify any problems and concerns. But it will take months before the vaccine will start to constrain new Covid-19 cases since tens of millions of people would need to have immunity before the spread starts to slow down. And while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness against disease, it’s still not clear how well it prevents asymptomatic infection. Scientists don’t yet know if people who are vaccinated could still transmit the virus to other people without getting sick themselves.

That means that until there is widespread vaccination, hospitals will still be battling severe Covid-19 as case numbers reach grim new heights. And handwashing, social distancing, and mark-wearing will remain the orders of the day for months to come, even for people lucky enough to receive a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'group', 'eua', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trial', 'authorized', 'placebo', 'million', 'fda', 'doses']",0
2020-12-12 13:50:06+00:00,6,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2020-12-12 12:53:44+00:00,13,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday evening granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, making it the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States to begin distribution outside of clinical trials.

The first 6.4 million doses could ship within days.

The announcement came after an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, voted 17 to 4, with 1 abstention, to recommend and EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The committee specifically voted on whether the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks in people aged 16 years and older.

The highly anticipated regulatory green light means health workers facing high exposure to the disease and residents of long-term care facilities can now start receiving the first doses of the two-dose vaccine.

That a vaccine for a disease only discovered late last year would be ready so quickly is already an unmatched scientific feat, but the fact that it’s also based on a new technology that yielded 95 percent efficacy in preventing disease makes the announcement all the more remarkable.

“The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a statement.

The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US follows green lights from regulatory agencies in Canada and the United Kingdom. Next week, the vaccine advisory committee will consider another EUA for the Covid-19 vaccine using a similar approach developed by Moderna.

But an EUA is only one step forward.

The vaccine must then be shipped to health facilities and administered in two doses. These steps present their own challenges, ranging from keeping the vaccine at the frigid temperatures it requires to getting patients to come back for a follow-up shot. Meanwhile, many of the health systems administering shots are struggling to care for a huge surge of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

This rollout will be part of the largest vaccination effort in history. But there will not be enough doses for everyone at the outset, even for people placed at the front of the line. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine around the world before the end of the year, enough for 25 million people — half of which has been pledged for the US. The first doses to roll out will be a crucial test of the vaccine distribution system in the United States, as well as a test of public acceptance and of the integrity of the clinical trial process.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is cleared for emergency approval. Now what?

One of the first challenges for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is getting it where it needs to go. That’s complicated by the fact that the vaccine requires temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, some of the coldest temperature constraints of any Covid-19 vaccine under development. Maintaining the cold chain from factories to distribution hubs to hospitals is crucial; otherwise, the vaccine may spoil and become ineffective.

Pfizer has developed its own temperature-controlled shipping containers that use dry ice to maintain the recommended temperatures for their vaccine for up to 10 days. But longer storage will require ultra-cold freezers, and not many clinics have the requisite hardware, so timing the shipments will be key. There may also be shortages of dry ice.

The next hurdle is figuring out who gets the vaccine first. The 6.4 million doses available at the outset are nowhere near enough to quench the raging Covid-19 pandemic that is still reaching new peaks in daily hospitalizations and fatalities.

An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted at the beginning of this month on a set of guidelines that prioritize health care personnel, as well as staff and residents of long-term care facilities. But these groups alone add up to about 24 million people, so states and local governments and health groups are having to narrow these groups further.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine also has to be administered as two doses spaced 21 days apart. That poses a problem because experiences with other vaccines show that people are really bad at getting follow-up shots. As many as half of patients failed to get their second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, for example. For the Covid-19 vaccine, side effects from the first dose, scheduling conflicts, or supply shortages may inhibit recipients from getting the second dose.

The good news is that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may offer some protection against Covid-19 from the first dose, although it takes a few days for the shielding to build up. In fact, some experts, including former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, argued that the entire allotment of doses should be given to as many people as possible, as fast as possible, rather than withholding injections to give to people as second shots.

“We should get as many shots in our arms as possible right away,” he told USA Today on Monday. “The idea that we need to cut (the doses) in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the second dose … I just fundamentally disagree with that.”

But other experts say there isn’t yet enough data on a single dose to know whether it will provide enough protection from the virus for the broader population.

Meanwhile, the FDA is likely to authorize another Covid-19 vaccine in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the distribution of 25 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough for 12.5 million people on the two-dose regimen.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, the program from the Department of Health and Human Services to accelerate and deploy Covid-19 vaccines, said he expects 20 million Americans will be vaccinated in December, 30 million more in January, and 50 million more in February as more vaccines with promising early results are approved.

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines must continue, but they’re going to get harder to complete as placebo participants leave to get vaccinated

An EUA is a critical step, but it’s not full approval, and it signals that the FDA still wants answers to key questions, like long-term safety. The standards for an EUA for a vaccine is that there is an urgent public health need, the proposed vaccine may have a beneficial effect, and that there are no approved alternatives. The FDA also set a minimum threshold of 50 percent efficacy for a Covid-19 vaccine, a line that several vaccines have completely vaulted.

So far, Pfizer and BioNTech are only reporting two months of observational safety for their phase 3 clinical trial, although the companies have committed to continue monitoring their more than 43,000 trial participants.

But at the same time, Covid-19 is spreading rampantly in the United States, and more than 20,000 people in Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial have received a placebo rather than the actual vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the disease. Of the 178 reported cases of Covid-19 in the trial pool, 169 were in the placebo group. Of those, 9 in the placebo group and 1 in the vaccine group experienced severe Covid-19. As time goes on, more people in the placebo group will likely get sick and some will fall severely ill, requiring hospitalization. Without intervention, some of these people in the placebo group may die.

The EUA now presents a huge dilemma for the clinical trial. People in the placebo group may be at risk of Covid-19, but if they receive the vaccine, it would diminish the value of the trial and make it harder to answer questions about safety and efficacy, particularly in vulnerable subgroups like older adults.

And since this is a double-blind clinical trial, neither the recipients nor the companies know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. Vaccinating the placebo group would require breaking this blind, and if participants find out which group they’re in, they could change their behavior. People who received the vaccine may engage in riskier behavior while people in the placebo group may end up taking more precautions if they decide not to get vaccinated themselves. Those changes in behavior will make it harder to isolate the effects of the vaccine.

William C. Gruber, senior vice president for vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, told the FDA vaccine advisory committee on Thursday that the company has an ethical obligation to inform trial participants that the vaccine has received an EUA, but they are working on coming up with ways to maintain the integrity of the trial as much as possible.

“Eligible participants in the placebo group will have the option to receive the vaccine,” Gruber said. “We are currently in discussions with the FDA about the best way to vaccinate placebo recipients.”

Gruber added that the study will continue for 24 months regardless, with ongoing monitoring of the trial participants. This sort of large-scale and long-term follow-up is key because there may be rare complications that emerge that weren’t detected over a shorter time frame or were not present in the selected pool of participants in the trial.

Already, the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK has revealed that people with severe allergies could face complications.

“[T]he expectation would be that subjects with known severe reaction — allergic reaction — should not take the vaccine until we understand exactly what happened here,” Slaoui told reporters on Wednesday.

More people receiving this inoculation will further clarify any problems and concerns. But it will take months before the vaccine will start to constrain new Covid-19 cases since tens of millions of people would need to have immunity before the spread starts to slow down. And while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness against disease, it’s still not clear how well it prevents asymptomatic infection. Scientists don’t yet know if people who are vaccinated could still transmit the virus to other people without getting sick themselves.

That means that until there is widespread vaccination, hospitals will still be battling severe Covid-19 as case numbers reach grim new heights. And handwashing, social distancing, and mark-wearing will remain the orders of the day for months to come, even for people lucky enough to receive a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'group', 'eua', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trial', 'authorized', 'placebo', 'million', 'fda', 'doses']",0

As many as half of patients failed to get their second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, for example. For the Covid-19 vaccine, side effects from the first dose, scheduling conflicts, or supply shortages may inhibit recipients from getting the second dose.

The good news is that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may offer some protection against Covid-19 from the first dose, although it takes a few days for the shielding to build up. In fact, some experts, including former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, argued that the entire allotment of doses should be given to as many people as possible, as fast as possible, rather than withholding injections to give to people as second shots.

“We should get as many shots in our arms as possible right away,” he told USA Today on Monday. “The idea that we need to cut (the doses) in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the second dose … I just fundamentally disagree with that.”

But other experts say there isn’t yet enough data on a single dose to know whether it will provide enough protection from the virus for the broader population.

Meanwhile, the FDA is likely to authorize another Covid-19 vaccine in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the distribution of 25 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough for 12.5 million people on the two-dose regimen.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, the program from the Department of Health and Human Services to accelerate and deploy Covid-19 vaccines, said he expects 20 million Americans will be vaccinated in December, 30 million more in January, and 50 million more in February as more vaccines with promising early results are approved.

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines must continue, but they’re going to get harder to complete as placebo participants leave to get vaccinated

An EUA is a critical step, but it’s not full approval, and it signals that the FDA still wants answers to key questions, like long-term safety. The standards for an EUA for a vaccine is that there is an urgent public health need, the proposed vaccine may have a beneficial effect, and that there are no approved alternatives. The FDA also set a minimum threshold of 50 percent efficacy for a Covid-19 vaccine, a line that several vaccines have completely vaulted.

So far, Pfizer and BioNTech are only reporting two months of observational safety for their phase 3 clinical trial, although the companies have committed to continue monitoring their more than 43,000 trial participants.

But at the same time, Covid-19 is spreading rampantly in the United States, and more than 20,000 people in Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial have received a placebo rather than the actual vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the disease. Of the 178 reported cases of Covid-19 in the trial pool, 169 were in the placebo group. Of those, 9 in the placebo group and 1 in the vaccine group experienced severe Covid-19. As time goes on, more people in the placebo group will likely get sick and some will fall severely ill, requiring hospitalization. Without intervention, some of these people in the placebo group may die.

The EUA now presents a huge dilemma for the clinical trial. People in the placebo group may be at risk of Covid-19, but if they receive the vaccine, it would diminish the value of the trial and make it harder to answer questions about safety and efficacy, particularly in vulnerable subgroups like older adults.

And since this is a double-blind clinical trial, neither the recipients nor the companies know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. Vaccinating the placebo group would require breaking this blind, and if participants find out which group they’re in, they could change their behavior. People who received the vaccine may engage in riskier behavior while people in the placebo group may end up taking more precautions if they decide not to get vaccinated themselves. Those changes in behavior will make it harder to isolate the effects of the vaccine.

William C. Gruber, senior vice president for vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, told the FDA vaccine advisory committee on Thursday that the company has an ethical obligation to inform trial participants that the vaccine has received an EUA, but they are working on coming up with ways to maintain the integrity of the trial as much as possible.

“Eligible participants in the placebo group will have the option to receive the vaccine,” Gruber said. “We are currently in discussions with the FDA about the best way to vaccinate placebo recipients.”

Gruber added that the study will continue for 24 months regardless, with ongoing monitoring of the trial participants. This sort of large-scale and long-term follow-up is key because there may be rare complications that emerge that weren’t detected over a shorter time frame or were not present in the selected pool of participants in the trial.

Already, the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK has revealed that people with severe allergies could face complications.

“[T]he expectation would be that subjects with known severe reaction — allergic reaction — should not take the vaccine until we understand exactly what happened here,” Slaoui told reporters on Wednesday.

More people receiving this inoculation will further clarify any problems and concerns. But it will take months before the vaccine will start to constrain new Covid-19 cases since tens of millions of people would need to have immunity before the spread starts to slow down. And while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness against disease, it’s still not clear how well it prevents asymptomatic infection. Scientists don’t yet know if people who are vaccinated could still transmit the virus to other people without getting sick themselves.

That means that until there is widespread vaccination, hospitals will still be battling severe Covid-19 as case numbers reach grim new heights. And handwashing, social distancing, and mark-wearing will remain the orders of the day for months to come, even for people lucky enough to receive a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'group', 'eua', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trial', 'authorized', 'placebo', 'million', 'fda', 'doses']",0
2020-12-12 04:01:07+00:00,2,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday evening granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, making it the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States to begin distribution outside of clinical trials.

The first 6.4 million doses could ship within days.

The announcement came after an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, voted 17 to 4, with 1 abstention, to recommend and EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The committee specifically voted on whether the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks in people aged 16 years and older.

The highly anticipated regulatory green light means health workers facing high exposure to the disease and residents of long-term care facilities can now start receiving the first doses of the two-dose vaccine.

That a vaccine for a disease only discovered late last year would be ready so quickly is already an unmatched scientific feat, but the fact that it’s also based on a new technology that yielded 95 percent efficacy in preventing disease makes the announcement all the more remarkable.

“The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a statement.

The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US follows green lights from regulatory agencies in Canada and the United Kingdom. Next week, the vaccine advisory committee will consider another EUA for the Covid-19 vaccine using a similar approach developed by Moderna.

But an EUA is only one step forward.

The vaccine must then be shipped to health facilities and administered in two doses. These steps present their own challenges, ranging from keeping the vaccine at the frigid temperatures it requires to getting patients to come back for a follow-up shot. Meanwhile, many of the health systems administering shots are struggling to care for a huge surge of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

This rollout will be part of the largest vaccination effort in history. But there will not be enough doses for everyone at the outset, even for people placed at the front of the line. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine around the world before the end of the year, enough for 25 million people — half of which has been pledged for the US. The first doses to roll out will be a crucial test of the vaccine distribution system in the United States, as well as a test of public acceptance and of the integrity of the clinical trial process.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is cleared for emergency approval. Now what?

One of the first challenges for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is getting it where it needs to go. That’s complicated by the fact that the vaccine requires temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, some of the coldest temperature constraints of any Covid-19 vaccine under development. Maintaining the cold chain from factories to distribution hubs to hospitals is crucial; otherwise, the vaccine may spoil and become ineffective.

Pfizer has developed its own temperature-controlled shipping containers that use dry ice to maintain the recommended temperatures for their vaccine for up to 10 days. But longer storage will require ultra-cold freezers, and not many clinics have the requisite hardware, so timing the shipments will be key. There may also be shortages of dry ice.

The next hurdle is figuring out who gets the vaccine first. The 6.4 million doses available at the outset are nowhere near enough to quench the raging Covid-19 pandemic that is still reaching new peaks in daily hospitalizations and fatalities.

An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted at the beginning of this month on a set of guidelines that prioritize health care personnel, as well as staff and residents of long-term care facilities. But these groups alone add up to about 24 million people, so states and local governments and health groups are having to narrow these groups further.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine also has to be administered as two doses spaced 21 days apart. That poses a problem because experiences with other vaccines show that people are really bad at getting follow-up shots. As many as half of patients failed to get their second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, for example.

Already, the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK has revealed that people with severe allergies could face complications.

“[T]he expectation would be that subjects with known severe reaction — allergic reaction — should not take the vaccine until we understand exactly what happened here,” Slaoui told reporters on Wednesday.

More people receiving this inoculation will further clarify any problems and concerns. But it will take months before the vaccine will start to constrain new Covid-19 cases since tens of millions of people would need to have immunity before the spread starts to slow down. And while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness against disease, it’s still not clear how well it prevents asymptomatic infection. Scientists don’t yet know if people who are vaccinated could still transmit the virus to other people without getting sick themselves.

That means that until there is widespread vaccination, hospitals will still be battling severe Covid-19 as case numbers reach grim new heights. And handwashing, social distancing, and mark-wearing will remain the orders of the day for months to come, even for people lucky enough to receive a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'group', 'eua', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trial', 'authorized', 'placebo', 'million', 'fda', 'doses']",0
2020-12-11 00:31:01+00:00,2,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday evening granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, making it the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States to begin distribution outside of clinical trials.

The first 6.4 million doses could ship within days.

The announcement came after an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, voted 17 to 4, with 1 abstention, to recommend and EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The committee specifically voted on whether the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks in people aged 16 years and older.

The highly anticipated regulatory green light means health workers facing high exposure to the disease and residents of long-term care facilities can now start receiving the first doses of the two-dose vaccine.

That a vaccine for a disease only discovered late last year would be ready so quickly is already an unmatched scientific feat, but the fact that it’s also based on a new technology that yielded 95 percent efficacy in preventing disease makes the announcement all the more remarkable.

“The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a statement.

The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US follows green lights from regulatory agencies in Canada and the United Kingdom. Next week, the vaccine advisory committee will consider another EUA for the Covid-19 vaccine using a similar approach developed by Moderna.

But an EUA is only one step forward.

The vaccine must then be shipped to health facilities and administered in two doses. These steps present their own challenges, ranging from keeping the vaccine at the frigid temperatures it requires to getting patients to come back for a follow-up shot. Meanwhile, many of the health systems administering shots are struggling to care for a huge surge of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

This rollout will be part of the largest vaccination effort in history. But there will not be enough doses for everyone at the outset, even for people placed at the front of the line. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine around the world before the end of the year, enough for 25 million people — half of which has been pledged for the US. The first doses to roll out will be a crucial test of the vaccine distribution system in the United States, as well as a test of public acceptance and of the integrity of the clinical trial process.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is cleared for emergency approval. Now what?

One of the first challenges for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is getting it where it needs to go. That’s complicated by the fact that the vaccine requires temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, some of the coldest temperature constraints of any Covid-19 vaccine under development. Maintaining the cold chain from factories to distribution hubs to hospitals is crucial; otherwise, the vaccine may spoil and become ineffective.

Pfizer has developed its own temperature-controlled shipping containers that use dry ice to maintain the recommended temperatures for their vaccine for up to 10 days. But longer storage will require ultra-cold freezers, and not many clinics have the requisite hardware, so timing the shipments will be key. There may also be shortages of dry ice.

The next hurdle is figuring out who gets the vaccine first. The 6.4 million doses available at the outset are nowhere near enough to quench the raging Covid-19 pandemic that is still reaching new peaks in daily hospitalizations and fatalities.

An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted at the beginning of this month on a set of guidelines that prioritize health care personnel, as well as staff and residents of long-term care facilities. But these groups alone add up to about 24 million people, so states and local governments and health groups are having to narrow these groups further.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine also has to be administered as two doses spaced 21 days apart. That poses a problem because experiences with other vaccines show that people are really bad at getting follow-up shots. As many as half of patients failed to get their second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, for example. For the Covid-19 vaccine, side effects from the first dose, scheduling conflicts, or supply shortages may inhibit recipients from getting the second dose.

The good news is that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may offer some protection against Covid-19 from the first dose, although it takes a few days for the shielding to build up. In fact, some experts, including former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, argued that the entire allotment of doses should be given to as many people as possible, as fast as possible, rather than withholding injections to give to people as second shots.

“We should get as many shots in our arms as possible right away,” he told USA Today on Monday. “The idea that we need to cut (the doses) in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the second dose … I just fundamentally disagree with that.”

But other experts say there isn’t yet enough data on a single dose to know whether it will provide enough protection from the virus for the broader population.

Meanwhile, the FDA is likely to authorize another Covid-19 vaccine in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the distribution of 25 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough for 12.5 million people on the two-dose regimen.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, the program from the Department of Health and Human Services to accelerate and deploy Covid-19 vaccines, said he expects 20 million Americans will be vaccinated in December, 30 million more in January, and 50 million more in February as more vaccines with promising early results are approved.

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines must continue, but they’re going to get harder to complete as placebo participants leave to get vaccinated

An EUA is a critical step, but it’s not full approval, and it signals that the FDA still wants answers to key questions, like long-term safety. The standards for an EUA for a vaccine is that there is an urgent public health need, the proposed vaccine may have a beneficial effect, and that there are no approved alternatives. The FDA also set a minimum threshold of 50 percent efficacy for a Covid-19 vaccine, a line that several vaccines have completely vaulted.

So far, Pfizer and BioNTech are only reporting two months of observational safety for their phase 3 clinical trial, although the companies have committed to continue monitoring their more than 43,000 trial participants.

But at the same time, Covid-19 is spreading rampantly in the United States, and more than 20,000 people in Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial have received a placebo rather than the actual vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the disease. Of the 178 reported cases of Covid-19 in the trial pool, 169 were in the placebo group. Of those, 9 in the placebo group and 1 in the vaccine group experienced severe Covid-19. As time goes on, more people in the placebo group will likely get sick and some will fall severely ill, requiring hospitalization. Without intervention, some of these people in the placebo group may die.

The EUA now presents a huge dilemma for the clinical trial. People in the placebo group may be at risk of Covid-19, but if they receive the vaccine, it would diminish the value of the trial and make it harder to answer questions about safety and efficacy, particularly in vulnerable subgroups like older adults.

And since this is a double-blind clinical trial, neither the recipients nor the companies know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. Vaccinating the placebo group would require breaking this blind, and if participants find out which group they’re in, they could change their behavior. People who received the vaccine may engage in riskier behavior while people in the placebo group may end up taking more precautions if they decide not to get vaccinated themselves. Those changes in behavior will make it harder to isolate the effects of the vaccine.

William C. Gruber, senior vice president for vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, told the FDA vaccine advisory committee on Thursday that the company has an ethical obligation to inform trial participants that the vaccine has received an EUA, but they are working on coming up with ways to maintain the integrity of the trial as much as possible.

“Eligible participants in the placebo group will have the option to receive the vaccine,” Gruber said. “We are currently in discussions with the FDA about the best way to vaccinate placebo recipients.”

Gruber added that the study will continue for 24 months regardless, with ongoing monitoring of the trial participants. This sort of large-scale and long-term follow-up is key because there may be rare complications that emerge that weren’t detected over a shorter time frame or were not present in the selected pool of participants in the trial.

2020-12-10 23:04:14+00:00,6,"The first 6.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses may begin to ship out in the US as early as this weekend, after the Food and Drug Administration approves an emergency use authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The EUA is expected to be imminent following the Thursday vote of an advisory committee, which recommended it in a 17-4-1 vote. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, these doses will be earmarked for front-line health care workers, as well as residents and staff of long-term care facilities.

The government estimates another 13.6 million people in these high-risk groups might be able to be vaccinated by the end of 2020, with the rest of the US population following in about the next six months.

Many experts, however, are concerned that the US has not adequately prepared for mass Covid-19 vaccination. “The logistics of vaccine administration and distribution are complex,” Stanley Kent, chief pharmacy officer for Michigan Medicine, wrote in an email to Vox. Especially for vaccines that have such stringent cold storage needs and require two precisely timed doses — during a pandemic that’s taking more than 2,000 lives a day on average.

The first, smaller rollout to health care workers will ultimately be a critical test of vaccine distribution and administration tactics — and a chance to make adjustments before the country tries to have hundreds of millions more people roll up their sleeves.

Health systems have been working quickly and furiously to figure out how to make these first doses go well. But there are substantial hurdles, from dealing with delicate vaccines to keeping track of the millions of people who get the shot and will need to return for a second one.

Although most of us will be waiting many more months until we might be able to get vaccinated, here are the important things to watch out for as the first health care workers get the Covid-19 vaccine in the US.

Getting the vaccine out of the freezers and to vaccinators

As the first Covid-19 immunization to be submitted to the FDA for emergency use authorization, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is expected to be the first to receive this initial green light, followed by Moderna next week. But Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine has the most extreme temperature requirements, needing to be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, and only viable for five days in standard refrigeration and six hours at room temperature. (And although slightly less sensitive, the Moderna vaccine still needs to be kept frozen at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit until 30 days before it is used, and then needs to be refrigerated, until at most 12 hours before administration.)

Very few facilities have the medical-grade ultra-cold freezers needed to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, so it will be shipped to hub locations to be distributed — packed in dry ice — to hospitals, clinics, and other vaccination sites. This will take finely tuned planning to ensure that just the right number of vaccine doses make it to just the right place at just the right time.

“The challenges of redistribution are inventory management, getting the right number of doses to each administration site to minimize waste, and cold chain adherence,” Kent explained.

With these cold requirements, even simply removing the vaccine from the super-cold freezers could be a bottleneck, since it requires special gloves. And to keep freezers at the right temperature, they’re not supposed to be opened more than a couple of times a day and for no more than a minute at a time, NPR reported.

Doses are also not ready to give once they are out of the freezer. The vaccine vials Pfizer is sending out actually contain five doses of the vaccine — and need to be mixed with 1.8 ml of saline solution before being given. “Preparing the product for administration is a multi-step process, requiring thaw time, reconstitution, and drawing it up” into the syringe, Kavish Choudhary, director of inpatient and infusion pharmacy services at the University of Utah Health, explained. These are yet more logistical steps in the process that needs to be carefully plotted out and well staffed.

Finally, there is the issue of ensuring all the IT systems are in place to record each dose and recipient and report it to the state database within 24 hours. This will allow any adverse events to be reported and linked to a particular run of vaccine — but it is also how we will be able to know if and when someone has received one or both doses. Some health system administrators are still suggesting those receiving the vaccine keep the paper vaccination card they will receive and even take a picture of it with their phone, in case systems go down.

Ensuring all of these steps hold — and work together — is not only essential for the success of these first doses for the very highest-risk people, but also as we look at scaling way up to hundreds of millions of people in the first half of 2021.

Deciding who should get a vaccine — and finding them

There will not be nearly enough vaccine in the first shipments to vaccinate every health care worker (21 million people) or nursing home resident or staff (3 million people) in the country. (Custodial staff, people who deliver meals to patient rooms, and those who transport patients are among the many others in these groups.)

The federal government has decided to allocate doses based on state adult populations, rather than the number of potential recipients in each of the risk categories. This means not all states will be able to vaccinate the same proportion of their health care workforce right away (a pattern that is likely to reappear with other category-based allocations down the road).

There's definitely a big focus on mapping if we have enough vaccine to cover high priority pops, like this planner.



Delivery - How many vaccinations can one heath worker deliver in a day? When are folks available to get vaccinated? - is also complex. https://t.co/1W99JwsmHv — Amanda Makulec MPH (@abmakulec) December 3, 2020

So although health care workers are among those eligible for the first round of vaccines, states and health care systems will have to decide which ones can get it and when. (Further information in an emergency use authorization from the FDA could add additional clarification for whom to vaccinate first.)

Choudhary says they are “prioritizing healthcare workers that work in areas that have regular and frequent interactions with Covid-19 positive patients,” in an email to Vox. This includes some working in the ER, ICUs, medicine units, urgent care, and testing facilities. This will hopefully help more people stay healthier and preserve the capacity of these essential staff as pandemic hospitalizations spike — and it is an approach many health systems are taking.

Yale New Haven Health, which provides care to people across Connecticut, will be opening up appointments to their 30,000-plus employees in alphabetical order instead. There are a few reasons for this. First, it ensures a level of randomization that will make the process transparent and equitable. Second, the frontrunning vaccines are known to have occasional minor side effects, such as fever.

So by vaccinating employees based on name rather than unit or office, they can help avoid multiple people from a team being out for a day or two after the vaccine. “That is one logistical hurdle,” says Brita Roy, director of population health at Yale Medicine, who is also a co-chair of the health system’s Covid-19 vaccine task force.

Down the road, these sorts of more granular prioritization or organization strategies will become essential, as the number of people eligible on the general priority list balloon. And other organizations, such as food service companies, might need to take similar lessons on strategic and equitable scheduling.

It’s tricky, though, to schedule people for appointments — no matter the order — when you haven’t been told how many doses are available to give. As of earlier this week, some states had not yet informed systems how much of the vaccine they will get in the first weeks. “One of the biggest challenges is not knowing how many vaccine doses we will receive,” Kent said.

Roy agrees: Having prepared other details — from deep freezers to distribution — now, she says, “our biggest challenge is keeping up with what the allotment will be on a weekly basis ... and designing around that.” Connecticut, for example, had to retabulate the numbers after the CDC announced that the first doses would be made available to residents and staff of long-term care facilities in addition to the health care workers it was already planning to vaccinate (meaning there would be fewer doses available for the latter group).

These shifts in quantities may continue to be a part of the vaccine administration landscape for months to come, forcing those planning the shots to quickly adjust their operations and scheduling.

Despite all these challenges, vaccinating health care workers is, in many ways, much simpler than reaching and scheduling members of the broader population for two doses. For one, many work for large hospitals or health systems that can use employee records to determine who should be getting the vaccine — and contacting them through the organization’s system.

Many vaccine hubs in health care settings, however, are also responsible for vaccinating workers outside of their system. Yale New Haven Health plans to set up sites to vaccinate health care workers from other hospitals and clinics that do not have ultra-cold storage to keep their own doses of the vaccine. This will require not only spinning up additional vaccination locations and distribution (“those will be a little delayed, maybe week two or three — we don’t have that nailed down exactly yet,” Roy says), but also getting in touch with those additional people.

Connecticut is helping provide some of the information about individuals who fit the priority category, but Yale New Haven Health will also need to establish communication with them and get them into the appointment system.

At Riverside Health in Virginia, Cindy Williams, vice president and chief pharmacy officer, explained to Vox in an email that their system has four of the state’s 25 facilities that can store the Pfizer vaccine, “giving us the ability to help distribute across physician practices and across the state at large,” she wrote. They plan to work with local health departments and other health care groups to reach other workers eligible for the vaccine. “I do believe that this experience will assist us in outreach to other populations as we move through the priority groups for vaccination,” she said.

Maximizing speed — and minimizing waste

Although nearly 6.5 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine might be available to ship the day after an emergency use authorization, there will be no way of getting all of those doses into top-priority arms in the following day or weeks. Health systems are carefully working out their logistics to maximize the number of workers they can vaccinate in a day, while also making the process as safe as possible. This is a challenge during a Covid-19 spike, and with cold temperatures in much of the country limiting how much can reliably be done outdoors.

Which means streamlining the administration process as much as possible, from getting all of a recipient’s information to ensuring each vaccinator has every supply they need on hand.

One simple requirement will be space. At University of Utah Health, Choudhary and others have been working closely with the facilities team to shuffle services around to clear room for vaccination locations to eventually vaccinate almost 20,000 health staff and students with two doses. These spots, he notes, will be in a clinic setting; “that way we have the appropriate equipment and personnel in place if we need to respond to an adverse reaction.”

During trials of the vaccines, participants were observed for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine to monitor for side effects, a step that would add a big hurdle to the logistics of safely moving people through during a pandemic. But recent guidance says that administration sites will not necessarily need an observation period, Roy notes — although some might still have a brief one — so people should be able to flow through fairly quickly after receiving their shot.

At Michigan Medicine, they are planning to initially vaccinate several hundred of their employees a day, building up to 1,000 to 1,500 per day, Kent said.

All of this also needs to be carefully planned to minimize any potential waste of precious vaccine doses. Once a five-dose vaccine vial is opened, it has only a six-hour shelf life before it goes bad.

Yale New Haven Health is working with a modeler to assess how to maximize “throughput” while ensuring they stock precisely the right amount of vaccine doses. They, along with many systems, are drawing from their experience with flu shot clinics this year, having people sign up ahead of time and staggering appointments for safety. “We’re going to try to keep it pretty precise,” Roy says. “We want to make sure that as many appointments each day are filled as possible.”

Fine-tuning these logistics and procedures in this first group of recipients will be essential to ensuring the vaccine is safely and efficiently given to the general population. Choudhary begs patience for the outset of this unprecedented effort. “We recognize the need and urgency to get our staff vaccinated so we can turn our attention to the community and our patients. We are limited by our supply and our lack of familiarity with the product, but have the appropriate time, personnel, and resources,” he wrote.

Ensuring adherence

Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are designed to be given in two doses, spaced either 21 or 28 days apart (depending on the vaccine) to reach the high levels of protection against Covid-19 reported in early trial results. So making sure people get their second shot when they are supposed to, and that it is the correct brand, is crucial.

Even those overseeing vaccination of health care system employees in their own organization have concerns about ensuring people make it back for their second dose.

For that reason, some groups are scheduling the second visit in person when people receive their first dose. At other places, they’ve been so busy putting together a plan for the first dose, adherence is second on the list. “We have not yet talked a lot about that,” says Roy. “I have not yet heard of a contingency plan of what happens if someone goes beyond two to three days beyond their window,” she says.

And finally, there is the question of making sure a second dose will be available at just the right time, in the right place. The federal government has said it will hold second doses back from the first shipments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, in part because once it leaves super-cold storage, it can only be kept on dry ice for 15 days and refrigerated for another five, just missing the vaccine’s 21-day mark for second shots.

This means the main hubs should receive second doses in time to give them. But the delicate ballet of coordination, distribution, and administration will need to begin anew before recipients roll up their sleeves again.

There will be a lot that might go off the rails, from IT systems to supply chains. “All health systems will learn a significant amount during the initial weeks of distribution,” Kent said.

“Operationally, this is the first time I can think of that we’re trying to disseminate a vaccine all at the same time,” Roy says. Even with the annual flu shot push, only about half of the US population typically gets vaccinated. “But this is different,” she says. “We need 80 to 90 percent [of the US population]. Logistically, how do we do that?”

And much of that will come down not just to the physical logistics but also to messaging. Even for health care workers.

At Yale New Haven Health, Roy notes that she has heard “a fair amount of vaccine hesitancy in places where I wouldn’t have expected. And these are people who get their annual flu vaccine and whose children are up to date on all of their vaccines.” When it comes to a Covid-19 vaccine, she suspects that many health care workers are mostly wary of being the first ones — after trial participants — to get the shot. And they are likely aware that getting both doses of the vaccine will still not yet change the precautions they need to keep taking, such as wearing PPE (in part because we don’t yet know if the vaccine keeps people from carrying and spreading the virus — or just from developing the illness).

She worries that if these health care workers skip out on their chance to get the vaccine now, doses might not be available to allocate to these higher-risk folks again until summer, after other risk groups have been covered and when it is more broadly open to the general community.

To encourage more health care workers to get the vaccine right away, Roy says, “we will be doing some more messaging around the safety profile of the vaccine.” But she still worries. “The amount of hesitancy I heard surprised me.” Working through it, however, should provide learning opportunities for messaging ahead of wider rollouts among the general population.

This will be essential, because, as Roy notes, “We’re going to need to get to 80 to 90 percent vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity” in the US.

Every lesson we can learn from these early rollouts will be valuable in reaching a broader population as effectively and quickly as possible as more doses become available. And health care systems know eyes will be on them in the coming weeks.

This means even the best-laid plans might need to change quickly. “It’s going to be important to be responsive and be nimble and to continually learn, and make the process better as we go,” Roy says.",voxdotcom,"['big', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'right', 'test', 'workers', 'roy', 'systems', 'care', 'need', 'second', 'distribution', 'begin', 'doses']",0
2020-12-10 22:45:05+00:00,21,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday evening granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, making it the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States to begin distribution outside of clinical trials.

The first 6.4 million doses could ship within days.

The announcement came after an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, voted 17 to 4, with 1 abstention, to recommend and EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The committee specifically voted on whether the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outweigh the risks in people aged 16 years and older.

The highly anticipated regulatory green light means health workers facing high exposure to the disease and residents of long-term care facilities can now start receiving the first doses of the two-dose vaccine.

That a vaccine for a disease only discovered late last year would be ready so quickly is already an unmatched scientific feat, but the fact that it’s also based on a new technology that yielded 95 percent efficacy in preventing disease makes the announcement all the more remarkable.

“The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a statement.

The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US follows green lights from regulatory agencies in Canada and the United Kingdom. Next week, the vaccine advisory committee will consider another EUA for the Covid-19 vaccine using a similar approach developed by Moderna.

But an EUA is only one step forward.

The vaccine must then be shipped to health facilities and administered in two doses. These steps present their own challenges, ranging from keeping the vaccine at the frigid temperatures it requires to getting patients to come back for a follow-up shot. Meanwhile, many of the health systems administering shots are struggling to care for a huge surge of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

This rollout will be part of the largest vaccination effort in history. But there will not be enough doses for everyone at the outset, even for people placed at the front of the line. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine around the world before the end of the year, enough for 25 million people — half of which has been pledged for the US. The first doses to roll out will be a crucial test of the vaccine distribution system in the United States, as well as a test of public acceptance and of the integrity of the clinical trial process.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is cleared for emergency approval. Now what?

One of the first challenges for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is getting it where it needs to go. That’s complicated by the fact that the vaccine requires temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, some of the coldest temperature constraints of any Covid-19 vaccine under development. Maintaining the cold chain from factories to distribution hubs to hospitals is crucial; otherwise, the vaccine may spoil and become ineffective.

Pfizer has developed its own temperature-controlled shipping containers that use dry ice to maintain the recommended temperatures for their vaccine for up to 10 days. But longer storage will require ultra-cold freezers, and not many clinics have the requisite hardware, so timing the shipments will be key. There may also be shortages of dry ice.

The next hurdle is figuring out who gets the vaccine first. The 6.4 million doses available at the outset are nowhere near enough to quench the raging Covid-19 pandemic that is still reaching new peaks in daily hospitalizations and fatalities.

An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted at the beginning of this month on a set of guidelines that prioritize health care personnel, as well as staff and residents of long-term care facilities. But these groups alone add up to about 24 million people, so states and local governments and health groups are having to narrow these groups further.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine also has to be administered as two doses spaced 21 days apart. That poses a problem because experiences with other vaccines show that people are really bad at getting follow-up shots. As many as half of patients failed to get their second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, for example. For the Covid-19 vaccine, side effects from the first dose, scheduling conflicts, or supply shortages may inhibit recipients from getting the second dose.

The good news is that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may offer some protection against Covid-19 from the first dose, although it takes a few days for the shielding to build up. In fact, some experts, including former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, argued that the entire allotment of doses should be given to as many people as possible, as fast as possible, rather than withholding injections to give to people as second shots.

“We should get as many shots in our arms as possible right away,” he told USA Today on Monday. “The idea that we need to cut (the doses) in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the second dose … I just fundamentally disagree with that.”

But other experts say there isn’t yet enough data on a single dose to know whether it will provide enough protection from the virus for the broader population.

Meanwhile, the FDA is likely to authorize another Covid-19 vaccine in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the distribution of 25 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough for 12.5 million people on the two-dose regimen.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific lead for Operation Warp Speed, the program from the Department of Health and Human Services to accelerate and deploy Covid-19 vaccines, said he expects 20 million Americans will be vaccinated in December, 30 million more in January, and 50 million more in February as more vaccines with promising early results are approved.

The clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines must continue, but they’re going to get harder to complete as placebo participants leave to get vaccinated

An EUA is a critical step, but it’s not full approval, and it signals that the FDA still wants answers to key questions, like long-term safety. The standards for an EUA for a vaccine is that there is an urgent public health need, the proposed vaccine may have a beneficial effect, and that there are no approved alternatives. The FDA also set a minimum threshold of 50 percent efficacy for a Covid-19 vaccine, a line that several vaccines have completely vaulted.

So far, Pfizer and BioNTech are only reporting two months of observational safety for their phase 3 clinical trial, although the companies have committed to continue monitoring their more than 43,000 trial participants.

But at the same time, Covid-19 is spreading rampantly in the United States, and more than 20,000 people in Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial have received a placebo rather than the actual vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the disease. Of the 178 reported cases of Covid-19 in the trial pool, 169 were in the placebo group. Of those, 9 in the placebo group and 1 in the vaccine group experienced severe Covid-19. As time goes on, more people in the placebo group will likely get sick and some will fall severely ill, requiring hospitalization. Without intervention, some of these people in the placebo group may die.

The EUA now presents a huge dilemma for the clinical trial. People in the placebo group may be at risk of Covid-19, but if they receive the vaccine, it would diminish the value of the trial and make it harder to answer questions about safety and efficacy, particularly in vulnerable subgroups like older adults.

And since this is a double-blind clinical trial, neither the recipients nor the companies know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. Vaccinating the placebo group would require breaking this blind, and if participants find out which group they’re in, they could change their behavior. People who received the vaccine may engage in riskier behavior while people in the placebo group may end up taking more precautions if they decide not to get vaccinated themselves. Those changes in behavior will make it harder to isolate the effects of the vaccine.

William C. Gruber, senior vice president for vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, told the FDA vaccine advisory committee on Thursday that the company has an ethical obligation to inform trial participants that the vaccine has received an EUA, but they are working on coming up with ways to maintain the integrity of the trial as much as possible.

“Eligible participants in the placebo group will have the option to receive the vaccine,” Gruber said. “We are currently in discussions with the FDA about the best way to vaccinate placebo recipients.”

Gruber added that the study will continue for 24 months regardless, with ongoing monitoring of the trial participants. This sort of large-scale and long-term follow-up is key because there may be rare complications that emerge that weren’t detected over a shorter time frame or were not present in the selected pool of participants in the trial.

Already, the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK has revealed that people with severe allergies could face complications.

“[T]he expectation would be that subjects with known severe reaction — allergic reaction — should not take the vaccine until we understand exactly what happened here,” Slaoui told reporters on Wednesday.

More people receiving this inoculation will further clarify any problems and concerns. But it will take months before the vaccine will start to constrain new Covid-19 cases since tens of millions of people would need to have immunity before the spread starts to slow down. And while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness against disease, it’s still not clear how well it prevents asymptomatic infection. Scientists don’t yet know if people who are vaccinated could still transmit the virus to other people without getting sick themselves.

That means that until there is widespread vaccination, hospitals will still be battling severe Covid-19 as case numbers reach grim new heights. And handwashing, social distancing, and mark-wearing will remain the orders of the day for months to come, even for people lucky enough to receive a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'group', 'eua', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trial', 'authorized', 'placebo', 'million', 'fda', 'doses']",0

2020-12-10 17:15:59+00:00,12,"The United States is on the verge of granting emergency approval to its first vaccine for Covid-19, in what will be the culmination of the fastest vaccine development effort in history. But with 3,000 Americans dying a day (as of December 9) from the disease, the wait has been nonetheless agonizing.

The Food and Drug Administration is meeting Thursday to consider the emergency use authorization (EUA) request from Pfizer and BioNTech for their mRNA vaccine for people aged 16 and older. The two companies have reported that their vaccine candidate is 95 percent effective at preventing disease, with no serious safety concerns. The FDA committee evaluating the vaccine has scheduled a vote on the EUA for Thursday afternoon. To support their application, Pfizer and BioNTech revealed critical details about their vaccine for the first time, which the FDA made available to the public on December 8.

The agency has also scheduled an EUA evaluation on December 17 for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Moderna, which has also reported about 95 percent efficacy. Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines require two doses spaced several weeks apart.

If granted an EUA, the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could begin rolling out to health workers and long-term care facility residents and staff — the two groups deemed the top priority by an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in the US within days. The United Kingdom and Canada have already granted limited approval to this vaccine, with hospitals in the UK starting to immunize people against Covid-19 this week. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine globally, enough for 25 million people, before the end of the year.

It’s likely the FDA will follow suit, but its lag behind the UK highlights the difficult balancing act of gathering enough information about a new vaccine that will be administered to millions of people amid the screaming urgency of a pandemic that’s killing thousands per day. Some researchers have criticized the FDA for sticking to its timeline despite early data about the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being available for weeks.

And there are still some important concerns beyond efficacy that will shape how the vaccine will be distributed and the role it will play in drawing down the pandemic. Here is some of the new information about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that was revealed this week and some of the questions that remain.

What we learned this week about the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine

The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is going over Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine clinical trial in a public meeting Thursday for the first time to consider their application for an EUA.

Until recently, the only information about the vaccine available to the public came from press releases. On Tuesday, the FDA published a 52-page briefing from the companies about their vaccine, revealing more detailed information about their clinical trial. The trial recruited more than 43,000 participants across a wide range of demographics. The results so far are striking and promising, and FDA experts expect that an EUA will likely be granted shortly after the committee votes on it.

One revelation this week was that the vaccine (also known as BNT162b2) begins to offer protection against Covid-19 after just one dose, although it seems to take some time to build up immunity. The trial detected 178 Covid-19 cases among its participants, with just nine in the group that received the vaccine and most of those occurring between the first and second doses. The second dose of the vaccine was administered 21 days after the first and getting both doses seems to confer stronger protection.

The FDA also revealed more information about the demographics of the participants in the trial. The companies recruited people across a variety of ages and ethnic groups, as well as people with existing health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease.

Across the board, the vaccine seems to shield people against Covid-19, but within specific subsets of the population, it’s harder to gauge efficacy since there are so few cases to compare between the treatment and placebo groups.

For instance, older adults face some of the highest risks of dying from Covid-19. While there were more than 800 people in each of the placebo and treatment groups over the age of 75, there were five detected Covid-19 cases in the placebo group and none in the group that received the vaccine. That demonstrates 100 percent efficacy in that age bracket, but it’s only based on a difference of five cases. Consequently, the reported confidence interval for that age bracket is massive.

And there were also groups that were excluded from the trial completely, including people under the age of 16, pregnant women, and people with certain immunological conditions.

The task for regulators will be determining how much they can extrapolate from the limited information they have in order to come up with recommendations for how to deploy this vaccine, especially in these high-risk groups.

The data this week also showed a range of side effects. “The most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site reactions (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), fever (14.2%),” according to the briefing.

However, one key side effect this week was revealed from outside the clinical trial. Two patients in the UK reported allergic reactions to the vaccine. It’s not yet clear what component of the vaccine triggered the reactions, but the UK’s National Health Service issued new guidelines saying that people with a history of significant allergies should not receive this vaccine.

The new documents this week also acknowledged some of the important unanswered questions in the vaccine trial.

These include how long protection lasts; the effectiveness in people at high risk for severe Covid-19, such as people with HIV/AIDS; effectiveness in people previously infected with Covid-19; effectiveness in children; effectiveness against mild or asymptomatic infection; effectiveness against transmission of the virus; effectiveness against mortality; effectiveness against mutated versions of the virus; and potential long-term complications.

The answers to these questions will influence how the vaccine will be distributed on a larger scale and will shape the ultimate decline of Covid-19 in the population.

Could, and should, the FDA have moved faster on a Covid-19 vaccine?

Americans may be watching with envy as the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine roll out in other countries and wondering why the US couldn’t get there sooner.

Writing in The Dispatch, Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins University, said regulators could have done more to speed up the process, especially given the urgency of the pandemic, and he argued that delays were political maneuvers:

Americans have a right to ask why an American vaccine has been approved by the British but not by Americans. Some sympathetic to the FDA career staff have suggested that the U.K. was careless in approving the vaccine quickly, but the real story is how the American government bureaucracy wasted time. ... As the FDA career staff ponder the safety of known transient side effects like fatigue, they should consider the thousands of Americans dying each day they sit on the application.

But other experts said that the FDA is already working as fast as it can without cutting corners. Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA who’s now a professor of medicine at Georgetown University, noted that the UK’s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), conducts its reviews differently from the FDA.

The MHRA looks at trial data on a rolling basis, evaluating it as it comes in, while the FDA evaluates more completed results. He also noted that both the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine use a technology that has never been approved for widespread use before. Not only does that introduce new scientific questions, it also raises concerns about how well these companies will be able to manufacture the vaccines at scale while maintaining a high level of quality.

“The public needs to understand that these are new technologies that have never been used to scale up to millions of doses before,” Goodman said. “Those factors mean to me a three-week review of all that is exceptionally fast.”

Another factor to consider is public trust. This is a vaccine that has to be administered to millions of people, but short of a government mandate, it has to be voluntary. But without a massive uptake of the vaccine, the pandemic will persist. The early days of distribution of the vaccine are especially critical: We’ll never have a second chance for the first rollout.

Getting people to get their shots requires assuring them that the vaccine is safe and effective and that the approval came without any political influence.

“The way you do that is you have everything transparent, get all the data published and discussed,” said Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Translational Institute. That’s a big reason why the FDA is making its evaluations of the vaccine public, unlike the UK.

And while it’s true that the US is now squarely in the worst days of the Covid-19 pandemic, with hospitalizations and daily deaths reaching new records, many of these effects are baked in for the time being. A vaccine prevents disease, but it does little to help people who are already sick and may do little for people who are already infected. Since the virus that causes Covid-19 can take up to two weeks before causing symptoms, with hospitalizations and deaths following after that, there is little a vaccine can do to reverse the incoming surge.

To begin to interrupt transmission of the virus, millions of people would have to receive the vaccine, and that could take months. “The vaccine isn’t going to stop deaths until we get further into this,” Topol said.

As the FDA noted in its briefing document, it’s still not clear how well the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can prevent deaths. “A larger number of individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and higher attack rates would be needed to confirm efficacy of the vaccine against mortality,” according to the document. “Benefits in preventing death should be evaluated in large observational studies following authorization.”

That means that until everyone that wants a vaccine can get one, the best ways to stall the Covid-19 pandemic remain what they’ve always been: handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks indoors with people outside your household and outdoors in crowds, and limiting unnecessary exposures. Meanwhile, the clinical trial of this vaccine will still need to continue in order to resolve crucial unknowns. But with a powerful tool like a vaccine in hand, the path out of the pandemic is the clearest it has ever been.",voxdotcom,"['public', 'pfizerbiontech', 'emergency', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'trial', 'approval', 'effectiveness', 'doses', 'fda', 'week', 'pandemic', 'considering']",0

2020-12-10 01:13:31+00:00,7,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2020-12-09 23:16:33+00:00,4,"When we talk about the Covid-19 vaccines, we aren’t necessarily talking about people getting one shot, then being done and good to go. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — which are the closest to approval — have two-dose regimens. You get one shot, and then a few weeks later, you’re supposed to get another one.

Among all the logistical challenges in distributing and administering a Covid-19 vaccine, this looks like one of the biggest.

That’s because, based on research that evaluated compliance with other multi-dose vaccines, patients are really, really bad at getting their second dose. Bad as in, as many as half of patients never do. Studies conducted in both the US and UK on the hepatitis B vaccine — which, like the Covid-19 vaccines, is supposed to have around a one-month period between the first and second doses — found that roughly 50 percent of patients failed to get their follow-up shot within a year after their first.

Given the urgency of ending the pandemic, we can hope for better compliance with the Covid-19 shots. But those findings are, as Ateev Mehrotra at Harvard Medical School put it to me, “humbling.”

“While I recognize the situation now is different and the rates of completion will almost certainly be much higher, these prior studies highlight that the logistical barriers with a two-dose vaccine are enormous,” he said over email.

The results from the UK study, written by researchers for the pharma giant Merck, “are worse than even I had expected,” Mehrotra said, with 46 percent of patients receiving the second dose within the recommended period (one month after the first dose). Even when the follow-up period was extended out to 13 months, just 54 percent of patients had been vaccinated with both doses as recommended by the manufacturer.

Adherence was dismal in the US study as well, which was also conducted with Merck’s support. It was actually a bit worse than in the UK. Only one-third of patients got their second dose within one month, and a full year later, barely half (51 percent) had received the second shot.

If you want more evidence, research on the three-dose HPV vaccine has also found that a significant portion of adolescents who get their first dose fail to get all three. There seems to be a pattern across different conditions and locations: Patients aren’t good at following up on their vaccines.

That could be a problem for our hope of a Covid-19 vaccine ending the pandemic. Countries, including the US, are already facing substantial hesitancy from residents who worry the vaccine approval process was too rushed or politically motivated. Scientists are encouraged by the results from these clinical trials, which should hopefully help alleviate those concerns. But if a large number of the people who begin their vaccination course fail to get full protection because they skip a second dose, then it’s only going to be more difficult to stop the coronavirus’s spread.

That doesn’t mean the Covid-19 vaccination campaign is doomed, though. For one, new clinical trial results show these two-dose vaccines might still be somewhat effective if the patient gets only one dose. But full compliance would of course be the ideal, and the US government is already working on plans to try to encourage better adherence to the two-shot schedule.

We need people to get their second dose — or hope a single dose is still effective

There is another complication in getting people their second dose: side effects. The hepatitis B vaccines do not really have meaningful side effects. But these new Covid-19 vaccines do.

“These new vaccines do result in a lot of flu-like symptoms. That is a sign that the vaccine is working, but I do fear that will be a barrier for people getting the second shot,” Mehrotra told me. “It is harder to get a shot when you know it may knock you out for a day.”

So communication will be important. As Stat’s Helen Branswell reported earlier this year, experts have been telling political and public health leaders that they need to educate the public on what side effects to expect (the main culprits are headaches, sore arms, fatigue, chills, and fever) and remind them those symptoms are actually a sign that the vaccine is doing its job.

Beyond this sort of communication, public officials can do more to make sure people get both of their shots. As part of Operation Warp Speed, the federal government is already planning to send vaccine kits to doctors and health clinics that include paper cards to help patients keep track of their dosages, as Business Insider reported last week.

Local and state health departments are still coming up with their messaging plans for a second dose, based on my conversations. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County health department in Texas, told me his agency has been holding frequent calls with the state, hospitals, and local health care providers to plan their vaccine distribution, including the challenge of making sure people get two doses.

Huang’s department and state authorities will have access to a public database with every person who’s received a vaccine — and which vaccine they received — and that information could be used to, for example, send text messages to patients reminding them to get their follow-up dose. But he also told me that unless state and local health departments receive more money from Washington to support these efforts, their work will be more difficult. The funding his agency received from the CARES Act is set to expire at the end of the year.

“We are definitely trying to look at our resources, juggle our resources,” Huang said. “The congressional action on some of this is pretty important as we’re moving into this stage of wanting to get a vaccine distributed.”

Certain interventions (such as reminders from doctors, school-based programs, social marketing, etc.) have been found to increase compliance for the HPV vaccine, according to a 2015 study. Even so, experts are worried.

“You’ll see a bunch of ideas on how to improve compliance,” Mehrotra told me. “But I don’t think we have any solutions that increase this to the levels we might want.”

That raises the question: What happens if somebody gets only one dose of a two-dose Covid-19 vaccine?

The Food and Drug Administration reported some tentatively good news Tuesday on that issue, releasing results that show one dose of the Pfizer vaccine still provides some protection against Covid-19 and that having only one dose is safe for the patient. The Pfizer vaccine was found to be more than 50 percent effective after the first dose.

However, that is still far from the 95 percent efficacy found after the recommended two doses. As immunology experts quickly pointed out on Twitter, it is still clearly preferable for people to receive both doses because that is their best chance to get long-term protection from Covid-19.

The estimated vaccine efficacy after the 1st (82%), between 1st and 2nd (52.4%) and after the second dose (95%) are all impressive! However, high affinity Ab and long term immunity likely require the 2nd dose and we should all adhere to the recommended regimen.

There is a risk of serious socioeconomic and racial disparities, already present in the case and death rates during the Covid-19 pandemic, cropping up with vaccinations, too. Black Americans are more skeptical about receiving a Covid-19 vaccine, and they are less likely to have a primary care doctor than white Americans.

So compliance campaigns based on primary care doctors following up with their patients might not have the same reach with that population. It’s not difficult to imagine a scenario in which not only are fewer Black Americans getting vaccinated in the first place, but fewer are getting the second dose that will give them the fullest protection against the virus.

Eventually, we may have a one-dose vaccine. Johnson & Johnson has been working on one, and though the company is behind Pfizer and Moderna in the approval process, it is still likely to seek FDA approval early next year.

But today, the most proven vaccines we have require two doses to be most effective. There are already plenty of unknowns about how well these vaccines will work — namely, how long they’ll provide protection from the virus — but one thing everybody could do is make sure we’re diligent about our follow-up appointments.

That’s not something people are ordinarily very good at. But it will be critical to bringing Covid-19 under control.",voxdotcom,"['explained', 'dose', 'compliance', 'covid19', 'patients', 'vaccine', 'health', 'problem', 'getting', 'briefly', 'second', 'shot', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-09 14:30:07+00:00,6,"The Covid-19 pandemic has infected more than 68 million individuals worldwide and killed 1.5 million people, including more than 285,000 Americans. And many hospitals are now running short on beds for the sickest patients.

Approximately one in 25 people with Covid-19 need hospitalization, and about 9 percent of hospitalized Covid-19 patients end up having acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hospital care does not guarantee survival, with Covid-19 killing about 2.1 percent of people who get it in the US.

We don’t always know why the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 ravages some people so much more horribly than others. But one thing many of these severe patients have in common is an overly active immune response.

This intense immune reaction to the virus often has features of cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). And, fortunately, we have drugs to treat this sort of immune response generally, including one President Trump took while he was sick with Covid-19, dexamethasone.

But these drugs must be given at the right time to Covid-19 patients specifically experiencing CSS, not simply all patients with severe Covid-19, to get the best outcomes. In short, we must optimize the drugs we already have. And there is still a lot we need to learn about how these sorts of treatments work in the case of Covid-19.

What we know about cytokine storms in Covid-19

Cytokine storm syndrome is an umbrella term for a variety of hyper-inflammatory reactions to various insults and triggers. It can be brought on by other viruses, such as influenza and Epstein-Barr virus, as well as blood cell-related malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia.

The diagnosis of CSS is complicated. There is no single agreed-upon set of criteria for deciding if someone has CSS without their already having another related underlying condition.

Pinpointing it in people with Covid-19 is even trickier, in part because levels of key blood markers are not as high as the levels seen in patients with CSS in other contexts. Additionally, severe lung inflammation is generally a late development in CSS, but it’s early in Covid-19.

Nevertheless, like other CSS patients, those with severe Covid-19 often develop multi-organ dysfunction syndrome in which organ damage appears to be caused primarily by excessive immune system activation and/or blood clotting, rather than by the virus itself.

These patients also have other overlaps with general CSS cases, including fever, liver dysfunction, low blood counts (particularly low lymphocyte counts), and very elevated markers of inflammation.

We still don’t know, however, exactly how Covid-19 triggers this hyper-inflammation. It only occurs in a subset of infected individuals, and there may be genetic risk factors. For other cytokine storm syndromes, 30 to 40 percent of patients do harbor mutations in genes that alter the immune response to infection. Time and further research will tell if something similar occurs with Covid-19.

Since the pandemic began, we have also learned more about the timeline of how these severe cases often go. And this can help determine how best to treat people.

For symptomatic individuals, infection with Covid-19 comes in phases, with the early days (the first week) dominated by viral replication leading into features of a flu-like illness (such as fever, cough, or diarrhea). In up to 20 percent of adults with symptomatic infection, shortness of breath with low blood oxygen levels may develop five to 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

And things can deteriorate rapidly from there. Hospitalized patients requiring oxygen support can quickly (often within hours) progress to requiring ICU management for ARDS, low blood pressure, and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction.

Confirmed predictors of patients at risk of developing more severe complications include being older than 60 and having obesity, underlying cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of asthma or other chronic respiratory disease. Recent studies have also identified several blood test abnormalities at the time of early symptom onset that are predictive of a patient developing more severe complications later.

But these sorts of tests are not routinely done. And it still doesn’t tell doctors exactly how best to treat these individuals who end up getting life-threateningly ill.

Antiviral drugs don’t help cytokine storms, but we are learning how some other drugs can

We do have some ways to attack the virus itself. Antiviral approaches are likely to be most beneficial early in the disease course when symptoms are first present and the virus is still infectious. But even then they haven’t by any means been a cure-all.

At present, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog that has received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, has been demonstrated to somewhat shorten hospital stays but has not been shown to improve survival. Other treatments hyped by the current administration, including hydroxychloroquine, have not proven to be effective.

Because none of the antiviral approaches have thus far been proven to increase survival rates or prevent the development of ARDS or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, we need treatments for patients fighting CCS in order to save more lives.

The most accessible and comprehensive anti-inflammatory approach to treating Covid-19 associated CSS involves the use of glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory steroids). These include prednisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, the steroid given to President Trump. Many hospitals have adopted dexamethasone as the standard of care for hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia.

These steroids not only inhibit cytokine production but also broadly tamp down many other aspects of the immune response, which makes them helpful in reducing harmful inflammation but also tricky to use — especially in the case of an infection.

As immunosuppressants, these drugs are associated with a vast array of side effects, including secondary infections. The use of glucocorticoids to treat previous fatal coronavirus epidemics, SARS and MERS, reported mixed results. There was even concern that the use of glucocorticoids may increase mortality, so the World Health Organization strongly discouraged their use early on during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Nevertheless, out of desperation, clinicians overwhelmed by the pandemic resorted to these drugs to lower the massive numbers of Covid-19 deaths.

So far, several retrospective analyses have reported lower Covid-19 mortality in glucocorticoid-treated patients compared to control groups. A September meta-analysis done by the World Health Organization also concluded that glucocorticoids do save lives for some hospitalized Covid-19 patients, reducing all-cause mortality over four weeks from 40 percent to 32 percent.

A randomized placebo-controlled trial of 2,104 hospitalized Covid-19 patients, published in July, reported a statistically significant decrease in mortality with modest doses of dexamethasone for those on ventilators, from about 41 percent in the control group to about 29 percent in those receiving the steroid.

Those not requiring oxygen, and perhaps not experiencing CSS, trended toward worse outcomes (14 percent in the control group died versus almost 18 percent of those receiving the treatment). Similarly, a recent study reported that patients with notable markers of inflammation improved with glucocorticoids, but those with lower levels fared worse.

These studies underscore the importance of careful patient selection for these treatments, namely that they should be used specifically to treat CSS in Covid-19 patients, not simply all patients with severe Covid-19. Initiating glucocorticoids as early as possible in CSS patients who will benefit, but avoiding needlessly immunosuppressing other patients who will not benefit from (and may be harmed by) them is a challenging needle to thread. Looking for biomarkers for hyper-inflammation during hospitalization could help clinicians determine which patients are the best candidates for treatment with these potentially lifesaving drugs.

Ideally, more targeted anti-inflammatories would be best to deploy in an effort to further lower Covid-19 mortality rates. We have a few leads, documented in high-quality studies of specifically anti-cytokine treatments in Covid-19 CSS patients, but the research is ongoing.

More recent — but lower-quality — studies suggest that we might have luck using less risky, targeted immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies, which have documented success treating non-Covid-19 CSS. Many of these treatments — including Tocilizumab (IL-6 blockade), IL-1 blockade, and emapalumab — have had mixed results and are still under investigation. Currently, for example, IL-6 blockade is not looking promising.

While we all eagerly await the availability of safe and effective vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent Covid-19, we need to optimize antiviral treatments and therapies directed against the associated CSS when it develops. New iterations of antiviral approaches will hopefully decrease the development of hyper-inflammation.

But until these arrive, glucocorticoids and/or anti-cytokine approaches will likely be necessary to save lives. With glucocorticoids already being readily available globally and relatively inexpensive, they may be our best therapeutic option for treating Covid-19 CSS worldwide for now.

2020-12-09 00:22:23+00:00,17,"The world is finally looking at a real end to the Covid-19 pandemic. But in the US, it now looks more likely than ever that things will get much, much worse before they get better.

On the one hand, the vaccine news so far is great — suggesting that the coronavirus vaccines will be more effective than most of the experts expected. On the other hand, Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US keep rising, while a vaccine is still likely months away for most Americans. Thanksgiving likely made things worse (but hasn’t yet shown up in the numbers). Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and other holidays in December will likely bring new potential superspreading events.

So I asked public health experts: How exactly does this all end? What can we expect in the next few weeks and months of Covid-19?

They said America faces two potential scenarios in the next several months.

1) The worst Covid-19 surge yet: With cases regularly coming in above 200,000 a day, Covid-19 hospitalizations topping 100,000, and deaths now above 2,000 a day, things are already quite bad. But it could get worse: Between public fatigue, holiday celebrations, and states keeping risky indoor spaces like restaurants and bars open, the death toll could climb well past 3,000 a day in the future. Unlike the spring, this time the outbreak may be truly national, and the public and leaders may not act, or at least not do enough. So the outbreak could remain bad and even worsening until deep into 2021, with the carnage ending only when a vaccine is widely distributed.

2) A less bad outbreak: It’s possible the public or different levels of government, seeing these concerning trends, will snap into action, renewing efforts to social distance and enforce mask-wearing. This scenario seems less and less likely in the near term, but even if a change in behavior happens after the holidays, it could mitigate much of the potential damage. That wouldn’t end America’s Covid-19 outbreak, but it could at least make it a little better in the months remaining before vaccination.

Regardless of which two of these scenarios plays out, a vaccine will eventually arrive. The rollout will be slow, as different local, state, and federal agencies and health care systems set their priorities in the next few months for who will get the vaccine first. And how fast it plays out will depend on many questions we don’t currently know the answers to: Will the public embrace the vaccine? Will governments and health care systems truly be ready to distribute it? Will the vaccine stop not just serious disease but transmission of the virus too?

Eventually, enough Americans should be vaccinated that Covid-19 will be far less prevalent — and many of our lives will go back to normal. The end of Covid-19 is coming. It may even be mere months away.

But this, experts say, makes the prospect of a continuously bad outbreak in the next few weeks and months before a vaccine is widely distributed even worse.

“We prescribe so much of the power and authority of this pandemic to the virus,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me. “We forget sometimes that, in the end, most of us hold that power and authority ourselves. And what we do with our behavior — how we, in a sense, swap air with neighbors, colleagues, friends, people we don’t know — will dictate what happens.”

We now can see a finish line. We just have to hold out for a bit longer to make sure more people make it there, with our actions dictating which of the two scenarios the US deals with in the months to come.

Scenario 1: America’s Covid-19 outbreak will likely get much worse

Right now, America is on track for an outbreak that surpasses the spring surge. Already, the country is seeing more cases and hospitalizations than ever before, and deaths are starting to near or hit record highs as well. “Close to 3,000 deaths per day — I mean, that’s one 9/11 every day,” Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of the Emory University School of Medicine, told me. “In the short term, I see a lot of problems, I see a lot of pain.”

Experts say it’s likely inevitable the numbers will get worse soon. On Thanksgiving week, the country set pandemic-era records for airplane travel. As families and friends gathered, they in effect hosted superspreading events — spending a lot of time close together, not wearing masks, and largely in indoor areas where bad ventilation made it easier for the virus to glide from person to person.

But the full effects of these gatherings won’t show up in all of the relevant data for weeks or potentially months, because the coronavirus takes time to cause symptoms, hospitalizations, and deaths — although we’ll likely start seeing at least cases rise as a result soon, if we haven’t already.

Meanwhile, local and state governments have kept open businesses that perpetually produce superspreading events. The research has pinned a lot of spread to bars and indoor dining — where people hang out close together for long periods of time, without masks, in poorly ventilated indoor areas — but most states have kept businesses open even as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have climbed to record levels. As long as these places remain open, and as long as the public continues going to them, the US’s epidemic stands to get worse and worse.

State governments have also been slow to take other precautions. As it stands, 13 states still don’t have mask mandates — even though face coverings and mandates have been shown in the research to help combat Covid-19.

“In the next one to three months, I do not anticipate us turning the corner dramatically,” Pia MacDonald, an epidemiologist at the research institute RTI International, told me. “If people don’t change their plans [for the holidays] significantly, I anticipate an acceleration of the number of new cases.”

Every state is now reporting more than — and usually well above — 4 cases per 100,000 people per day, a standard for out-of-control outbreaks. With so much virus out there, just about the whole country is vulnerable to an increase in gatherings and risky behavior over the holidays.

Given this, experts expect that 3,000 deaths a day is very likely, if not inevitable, and could be only the beginning.

“If you see another surge on Christmas, it’s a surge on top of a surge that we’re in right now,” Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. “There’s just so much burden of infection.”

Hospitals will also be increasingly strained, potentially to the point they can no longer take more patients. The consequences there aren’t just bad for Covid-19 — all the gains we’ve made with treatment will vanish if a hospital can’t treat the patient — but other kinds of diseases and conditions that will go untreated as health care systems no longer have the space necessary to see patients.

Preventing all of this will require a radical shift in what the public and leaders are doing right now. Otherwise, the toll of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths could continue to climb in the coming months, with widespread distribution of a vaccine remaining the only way out.

Scenario 2: The US’s Covid-19 epidemic is less bad

The worst scenario is not inevitable. With government and public action, the worst of Covid-19 could be avoided in the coming weeks and months.

Different levels of government could encourage people to stay home and close down risky spaces. Short of that, the public could take its own steps to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 — voluntarily social distancing and masking, whether they’re required to by mandate or not.

“It’s really in our hands,” Osterholm said. “European countries have demonstrated that when you take these actions, you can drive the case numbers down substantially.”

At this point, things are bad and likely going to remain bad for at least several weeks. But how the public and leaders react could make things less bad in the weeks and months after. That could bend the curve of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths — potentially saving a lot of lives.

This wouldn’t take new, groundbreaking strategies, but instead the kinds of policies we’ve all heard about throughout the pandemic. Government leaders could institute lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, or, short of that, require risky indoor spaces to close down. They could do more to encourage or mandate masking, and enforce those mandates. They could build up systems for testing and contact tracing (though how much the latter can help is limited, as there are simply too many cases for tracers to keep up with).

“Public health measures to close indoor environments now would probably take a couple of weeks to have an effect,” Crystal Watson, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. “But that’s, in the grand scheme of things, pretty quick.”

And the public could embrace proper precautions, regardless of whether they’re mandated. “We have seen that in the past,” Watson said. But, she cautioned, government guidance and restrictions are likely still necessary “to make a real difference.”

A key player here is the federal government. It’d be much easier for people to follow the precautions if they’re given economic aid to make up for lost income and revenue as they social distance, potentially losing jobs and temporarily closing businesses. With cities and states facing massive budget gaps because of the weakening economy, only the federal government has the resources to provide relief to Americans.

Other places have proven this can work. In the face of big second waves, both Israel and, more recently, Europe have shown that renewed action against Covid-19, either by partly closing down or locking down entirely, can reduce the spread of the coronavirus. (Though Israel has seen cases start to rise again as the country eased restrictions.)

America could follow a similar path. It’s just a matter of getting the public and its leaders to act.

Still, the reality is none of this seems particularly likely. Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are still trending up. Even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised against travel during Thanksgiving, more than 9 million Americans flew around the holiday — setting records for air travel during the pandemic. Local and state governments have, by and large, shown little sign of changing course from mostly reopening after the spring and summer outbreaks. Congress hasn’t passed a stimulus bill as the economy has worsened, with discussions at best slowly progressing.

But maybe as things get truly horrifying — as more hospitals start to hit capacity and turn away patients because they simply can’t do more — something will change. It might take the epidemic getting worse to get the public and leaders to make it better, but that would be an improvement over a continuous climb to a worse and worse situation for months on end.

A vaccine will arrive, but it will take months to roll out

Right now, it seems certain we’ll get an effective vaccine soon. But it’s not like we’ll all wake up one day, get vaccinated at once, and throw a parade about the end of Covid-19. It will be a months-long process, with certain populations — health care workers, nursing home staff and residents, the elderly, people with conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus, and essential workers — getting the vaccine first.

“This is going to be the largest mass vaccination campaign that the US has ever attempted,” Watson said.

So it really matters whether we get a continuously worsening epidemic or a less bad outbreak in the coming months. Will the US be distributing vaccines while suffering the worst outbreak so far, one that continues to worsen? Or will it be distributing vaccines as daily cases and deaths are coming down, making the situation less chaotic and horrifying?

Experts emphasize a simple point here: A vaccine can’t, obviously, prevent the infections and deaths we’ve already had. But if we just get more people to the point where they get a vaccine, then a lot of lives could be saved.

Beyond that, these factors will play into just how quickly a vaccine gets out to the public:

1) Are different levels of government truly ready to distribute a vaccine? This will be a massive project — some experts compared it to a New Deal — that involves building up infrastructure, transportation and storage means, data gathering, and communications campaigns. That will require a lot of support, both in time and money, from all levels of government. (Some officials say states need $8.4 billion to do this work. So far, they’ve gotten $340 million.)

2) Are health care systems ready? Getting a vaccine out to possibly more than 300 million Americans within months will be unlike anything health care systems have done. It’ll require technologies many systems don’t have, from refrigeration to transportation; a lot of staffing at a time when more health care workers are burned out by the pandemic; and very careful communication to patients about what the vaccine entails, including the need to return for a second dose as long as a Covid-19 vaccine requires two doses.

3) Is the public receptive to a vaccine? The more recent surveys show at least a third of the public is resistant to getting a Covid-19 vaccine. If that holds, it could stifle a vaccine’s ability to crush the coronavirus. There’s wide consensus among experts that a proactive communications campaign is needed to persuade the public to obtain a vaccine and, crucially, set expectations about potential side effects to ward off a possible backlash.

4) Does a vaccine only protect from disease, not transmission? Right now, the data shows that some vaccines could be more than 90 percent effective against Covid-19. But the data only shows the vaccine can stop serious illness at a rate of 90-plus percent, not that it can stop transmission by 90-plus percent. The vaccine may not stop infections much, if at all — maybe people don’t get as sick, but they can still carry the virus and spread it to others. So a lot more people, perhaps close to the whole country, would have to get vaccinated to stop Covid-19 for certain, instead of the lower threshold that herd immunity requires.

5) Are there any other hiccups? Perhaps people will consistently fail to get both doses, making the vaccine less effective. Maybe some places will be totally unprepared, even as some or most parts of the US are doing a good job getting the vaccine out there. A rare, scary side effect could pop up as millions of people get vaccinated, leading to a backlash against the vaccine. Maybe a vaccine will only offer protection for a few months, requiring people to get new doses even more often. None of these things are guaranteed to happen, but they would create new problems.

6) Could there be positive developments? Maybe it will turn out that the US is, as a whole, ready to distribute the vaccine. Maybe the vast majority of the public will embrace getting vaccinated as the epidemic gets worse and the data for the vaccine improves. Maybe new vaccines will come out requiring just one dose and with easier transportation requirements. All of this could speed up how quickly the country gets vaccinated.

How all of these factors, and surely more that we don’t even know of yet, play out will decide how long this process takes. Experts are confident there’s an end in sight to the Covid-19 epidemic in the US, but the question is how long into 2021, or even 2022 and beyond, Americans have to wait before crossing that finish line.

So this will take a while. We have many decisions to make before then that could save a lot of lives — or cause potentially tens of thousands more people to get sick, hospitalized, and die.",voxdotcom,"['americas', 'public', 'likely', 'lot', 'deaths', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'ends', 'epidemic', 'bad', 'months', 'cases']",0

Margaret Keenan, a grandmother who turns 91 next week, received the first of the UK’s 800,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine early Tuesday morning at the University Hospital in Coventry.

“I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19,” Keenan said, according to the UK’s National Health Service. “It’s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.”

The UK granted temporary emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine last week, beating the United States and Europe in the race to approve a vaccine. The country purchased 40 million doses of this version of the two-dose vaccine, which will go toward inoculating 20 million people through 2021.

After Keenan, the second dose went to, appropriately, William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old man from Warwickshire — giving the internet the chance to break out a lot of Bard jokes in addition to celebrating this historic moment. (And yes, he’s probably a relation.)

“It could make a difference to our lives from now on, couldn’t it?” Shakespeare said after getting the shot.

According to the BBC, about 4 million people in the UK could be vaccinated by the end of this month.

“This marks the start of the [National Health Service]’s herculean task to deploy vaccines right across the UK, in line with its founding mission, to support people according to clinical need, not ability to pay,” UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Tuesday.

“And while today is a day to celebrate, there is much work to be done,” he added. “We must all play our part in suppressing the virus until the vaccine can make us safe, and we can all play our part in supporting the NHS to deliver the vaccine across the country.”

The United Kingdom experienced one of the worst excess death rates in Europe in the first wave of the pandemic and experienced a deadly second wave this fall. As of Tuesday, the country has confirmed more than 1.7 million cases of Covid-19 and recorded more than 61,000 deaths in its population of roughly 66 million. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was himself gravely ill and hospitalized with Covid-19 in the spring.

Johnson, who has recently faced a revolt from his own party over Covid-19 restrictions, may get a much-needed political boost from the UK becoming the first country to approve and prepare to distribute a vaccine backed by rigorous clinical trials. (China and Russia have already begun administering their own Covid-19 vaccines to their populations, but they’ve done so before large-scale clinical trials have been completed, and serious questions remain about their safety and efficacy.)

After months of sickness and lockdowns, the first vaccinations in the United Kingdom represent some welcome good news: a real sign that there will be an end to the pandemic.

The United States likely won’t be too far behind the UK. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to grant emergency use authorization to the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine as soon as this week, after the FDA reviewed the company’s data on its efficacy, which is about 95 percent. That means vaccinations could roll out in the US before the end of the year, with health care workers the first in line.

But in the UK and elsewhere, the effort to vaccinate populations against Covid-19 is an extraordinarily challenging undertaking, one that could face serious logistical hurdles and public distrust.

Most of all, it’s going to take time. The United States is in the most dire phase of the coronavirus pandemic to date, recently setting hospitalization and single-day death records. A vaccine approval can’t undo the death and devastation that’s happening now.

2020-12-07 23:20:45+00:00,14,"The first shipments of Covid-19 vaccines could be just days away, as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots await regulatory approval. Within 24 hours of the Food and Drug Administration’s go-ahead, either of these vaccines could begin shipping throughout the US in weeks, if not days.

The vaccines’ successful journey from the pharmaceutical companies’ manufacturers to Americans’ immune systems will require more than just the vaccine itself. The inoculation of more than 300 million people in the United States will require everything from glass vials to syringes to sophisticated cooling systems. But since this summer, there has been fear that the production of these supplies won’t have ramped up enough by the time a viable vaccine is ready for distribution.

These worries aren’t unfounded. The early months of the pandemic saw strained supply chains and a slew of shortages. There was a massive manufacturing effort to boost the number of ventilators, and a logistical gridlock over personal protective equipment like N-95 masks. Testing has been delayed in recent months because there aren’t enough chemical reagents.

Now, the imminent arrival of Covid-19 vaccines brings with it a whole new round of supply chain worries. The groups that represent the links in the supply chain for vaccine production — drug companies, pharmaceutical supplies manufacturers, government agencies — have had months to prepare. Their overall attitude seems to be one of cautious confidence. Many of these companies say they’ve produced enough of the materials needed for the beginning of a mass vaccination campaign.

But that doesn’t mean they’ll have enough in the future. Some initial projects for vaccine production are already being reduced due to delays in securing enough raw material: Pfizer announced it will ship only half the vaccine supply it planned to distribute this year, though it expects to still make a billion doses available next year.

Meanwhile, the hardware components are coming together. Production of freezer systems to distribute vaccines is ramping up, and companies that produce pharmaceutical glass for vials have spent the summer preparing their production lines. The US government has also brought on the medical supply company McKesson to assemble handy vaccination kits filled with materials like syringes and needles.

Suppliers and experts told Recode that while distributing Covid-19 vaccines will take a significant amount of coordination, we shouldn’t expect widespread shortages of any needed materials — if everything goes as planned. The vaccines from both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna require two shots given weeks apart, which is certain to make the logistics even more complicated. And underlying the whole effort is a fear of waste and the idea that precious vaccine doses could go bad due to logistical failures.

“The most important question that countries have to ask themselves is where will this go wrong?” said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo at the International Air Transport Association. “If it goes wrong, and a vaccine is effectively no longer usable, that’s potentially a life that’s at stake.”

Then there’s the question of how willing to take a vaccine Americans will be. A November Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Americans would get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 50 percent in September. If enough people are willing to get inoculated and health care facilities have enough supplies and coordination to inoculate them, the effective end of the pandemic in the US could be months away, not years.

A leading vaccine must be kept very, very cold

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely be the first to receive emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and Moderna is expected to be next. While Moderna’s vaccine can be kept in a regular refrigerator for up to a month, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius, a fact that creates some major challenges for distribution.

For shipping and short-term storage, Pfizer has built packaging equipped with a cooling system that can keep the vaccine cold for up to 30 days if it’s refilled with dry ice every five days. This system also includes a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of the shipment. The Pfizer vaccine can also be stored in ultra-low-temperature freezers for up to six months.

Companies that supply such freezers have been working hard to meet the surge in demand. While many hospitals already have ultra-cold freezers, they’re typically used for other medical purposes, which means that hospitals need more. “Right now, we are out of everything,” an executive of So-Low Environmental Equipment, one of the makers of these freezers, told CNBC in November.

Alex Esmon of Thermo Fisher Scientific, which also makes ultra-low-temperature freezers, told Recode that the company started preparing for a surge in demand earlier this year and that orders have grown at least two-fold since then. He points out that thousands of doses can be stored in a relatively small freezer, which means that health care facilities can calibrate what cooling supplies they need based on how many people they expect to inoculate in a given time period.

“It doesn’t necessarily require a huge build-out,” Esmon explained. “It requires the right build-out based on what each clinic and hospital system determines is going to be their need.”

And then there’s the need for dry ice, both for Pfizer’s custom vaccine packaging and for other types of freezers that rely on the material. Dry ice companies have expressed some caution about the supply of carbon dioxide that they rely on, as there was a shortage of the compound earlier this year. While some of these providers say they’re fine for now, they don’t know what will happen once a vaccine receives authorization, but they anticipate a surge in demand.

“Right now we have a great supply chain of CO2, which is beautiful for us because we haven’t let down any of our customers in the last six months,” Marc Savenor, the CEO of the company Acme Dry Ice, told Recode. He added that his company is already hearing from transportation and pharmaceutics companies for advance orders.

Still, the unique temperature needs of the Pfizer vaccine necessitates some thinking ahead from facilities that will distribute it. The cooling requirements could make it harder to distribute in rural areas, and even some hospitals don’t yet have enough infrastructure to keep it cold.

Those planning to distribute the Pfizer vaccine have to decide between investing in ultra-low-temperature freezers, or buying lots and lots of dry ice, according to Jessica Daley, a supply chain expert at the health care supplier Premier. And as health care facilities consider the requirements of the first vaccine available, there are likely others down the line that will have different needs.

A Covid-19 vaccine means glass vials — and new alternatives

Anticipation of a vaccine has also boosted demand for pharmaceutical glass to make vials that will hold and protect doses while they’re being transported and stored. Vials are important because they allow for the shipment of multiple shots of a vaccine in the same container. These vials can’t be too big, because once they’re opened, the vaccine inside can spoil quickly. So we need a lot of vials.

Over the summer, there was enough concern about a shortage of vials that the German company Schott, the world’s largest producer of pharmaceutical glass, denied requests from drugmakers to reserve its borosilicate glass in advance. (Borosilicate is a type of glass that can protect the vaccine from contamination — like tiny glass particles — and high temperatures.) Schott says it made three out of every four glass vials used in all three stages of vaccine trials, and in preparation for a vaccine, the company aims to produce enough vials for 2 billion vaccinations. The Italian firm Stevanato Group, which also aims to produce enough glass for 2 billion doses, and the German company Gerrescheimer, have also committed to supplying pharmaceutical glass for vaccine containers.

US companies are also producing alternatives as protection against bottlenecks. For several years, the New York-based glass manufacturer Corning has been working on a novel type of pharmaceutical glass, but the pandemic has given the novel material new promise. Valor Glass is supposed to be stronger than borosilicate glass, and less likely to produce cracks that can affect the sterility of a vaccine dose. (Corning also produces borosilicate glass tubing as well as Gorilla Glass, which is used for smartphone screens.)

In June, Corning received a $200 million contract from the US government to expand production of Valor Glass. The company now plans to produce an extra 164 million vials annually by the end of 2021, which would be 10 times what it produced before the pandemic, according to Brendan Mosher, the vice president and general manager of Corning’s pharmaceutical glass business.

Another alternative is from SiO2 Materials Science, which makes medical-grade containers out of plastic that have a very thin coating of pure silica, the primary ingredient in most glass. The material can withstand incredibly cold temperatures, is lighter than traditional glass, and is less likely to break, SiO2’s chief business officer Lawrence Ganti told Recode. These high-tech vials are already being used by Moderna and other companies that make Covid-19 treatments. A $143 million contract with the federal government helped SiO2 Materials Science add hundreds more employees, and Ganti says the company will be producing vials for about 200 million doses every month by 2021.

Vaccines require lots of syringes and needles

When vials full of doses are delivered to and unpackaged at their facilities, health care workers will use needles and syringes to remove the dose from the container and inject the vaccine into patients. Across the US and the world, this will require an incredible number of syringes and needles.

Over the summer, Trump administration trade and manufacturing policy director Peter Navarro warned that it could take up to two years to manufacture enough syringes and needles to distribute a coronavirus vaccine nationwide. In a whistleblower complaint, vaccine expert Rick Bright also warned that the Strategic National Stockpile only had 15 million syringes and later urged members of Congress to boost the government’s supply. The country, the experts said, would need hundreds of millions of needles.

The government has ramped up the production of syringes and needles in the intervening months. The Department of Defense has spent $100 million to secure more syringes and safety needles in a deal meant to provide over 500 million safety syringes within a year to the Strategic National Stockpile. The federal government also loaned nearly $600 million to a Connecticut-based company called ApiJect, which produces pre-filled syringes that serve as an alternative to the standard methods of injection. This particular device hasn’t been used before — a fact that has prompted some confusion and concern, especially since the device has yet to be approved by the FDA.

Meanwhile, health care supplier McKesson has been charged by the federal government with assembling vaccine kits, which include needles and syringes, for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on behalf of the Strategic National Stockpile. The government is also working with Becton, Dickinson, and Company, also known as BD, which is one of the world’s largest producers of syringes and needles. BD aims to supply the government with 286 million syringes by early spring, many of which will be sent to McKesson to be included in the US supply of vaccine kits.

“This is a wonderful solution for providers because all of those little things that, like you said, you don’t often think about — the alcohol wipes, the Band-Aids, the syringes, the needles — those things will be provided in those kits,” Daley, the supply chain expert at Premier, told Recode, adding that they don’t anticipate a shortage of syringes.

Still, BD has also warned buyers not to stockpile or buy more than they need, and that health care providers planning to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine should not order injection devices on their own. But the company’s senior vice president for public affairs, Elizabeth Woody, expressed confidence in the plans, saying that the company felt prepared for the pandemic in part because of its experience with the H1N1 outbreak.

“We got a flavor of what might be required at a time like this,” Woody told Recode. “Since the start of the Covid pandemic, we’ve been working around the clock, discussing our needs with governments across the globe, and really running our needle and syringe production lines 24/7.”

The task of distributing vaccines to hundreds of millions of people is daunting

Taking all of the needed materials into account — freezers, glass vials, syringes, needles — there’s still a lot of anxiety around making sure that the vaccine ends up in the right place at the right time. No one wants vaccine doses to go to waste.

While Pfizer will distribute its own vaccine, McKesson will handle the distribution of the vaccine from Moderna once it’s approved. But there are other key players that are preparing for their role in vaccine distribution. Airlines are bracing to start moving the vaccine, even turning to passenger planes that have been grounded by low demand during the pandemic. Shippers like FedEx, UPS, and DHL are all preparing for deliveries, and some are boosting freezer storage while also balancing the demands of holiday season online shopping.

Once the vaccine arrives, there’s another hurdle before injection. Depending on their area and resources, local health facilities could vary widely in their ability to get vaccines to patients.

“My concern is there may not be enough storage capacity or staff to be able to vaccinate at the desired rate,” Northwestern professor Hani Mahmassani told Recode. “There’s a myriad of little things that can go wrong at that level, and you may not have the health care infrastructure to deliver.”

The second dose also presents unique challenges: Vaccine distributors injecting patients with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine need to be meticulous about which patients receive which vaccine, and keep track of who needs a booster shot just a few weeks later. Meditech, one prominent provider of electronic health records in the US, is working on providing a certificate to patients as they receive the first and second dose, for instance. US health officials have also said that people who get vaccinated will receive “vaccine cards,” harking back to the idea of immunity passports discussed earlier this year.

But that means that even if all the supply chains for delivering vaccines and supplies hold up, the greatest challenge will still be logistical: getting the right people to show up and receive the vaccine — and a necessary booster — at the right time. For health care facilities, that will mean a high level of coordination and meticulous tracking. There’s understandable fear that that might be a far-fetched goal, too. Nearly a year into the pandemic, Covid-19 testing is still crippled by long lines, delays, and confusion.

Even if the supply chain holds and the distribution of the vaccine goes off without a hitch, the public has to be willing to take the vaccine and get their booster shots in the right time frame. Large numbers of people need to be inoculated for the US population to reach herd immunity.

“If only 40 percent of the population gets vaccinated, this thing will not disappear,” said Hughes, the air cargo expert at IATA. Otherwise, he added, the vaccine is “a bit like a fire break when you have a wildfire.” It might slow the spread, but it won’t save the forest.

Testing has been delayed in recent months because there aren’t enough chemical reagents.

Now, the imminent arrival of Covid-19 vaccines brings with it a whole new round of supply chain worries. The groups that represent the links in the supply chain for vaccine production — drug companies, pharmaceutical supplies manufacturers, government agencies — have had months to prepare. Their overall attitude seems to be one of cautious confidence. Many of these companies say they’ve produced enough of the materials needed for the beginning of a mass vaccination campaign.

But that doesn’t mean they’ll have enough in the future. Some initial projects for vaccine production are already being reduced due to delays in securing enough raw material: Pfizer announced it will ship only half the vaccine supply it planned to distribute this year, though it expects to still make a billion doses available next year.

Meanwhile, the hardware components are coming together. Production of freezer systems to distribute vaccines is ramping up, and companies that produce pharmaceutical glass for vials have spent the summer preparing their production lines. The US government has also brought on the medical supply company McKesson to assemble handy vaccination kits filled with materials like syringes and needles.

Suppliers and experts told Recode that while distributing Covid-19 vaccines will take a significant amount of coordination, we shouldn’t expect widespread shortages of any needed materials — if everything goes as planned. The vaccines from both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna require two shots given weeks apart, which is certain to make the logistics even more complicated. And underlying the whole effort is a fear of waste and the idea that precious vaccine doses could go bad due to logistical failures.

“The most important question that countries have to ask themselves is where will this go wrong?” said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo at the International Air Transport Association. “If it goes wrong, and a vaccine is effectively no longer usable, that’s potentially a life that’s at stake.”

Then there’s the question of how willing to take a vaccine Americans will be. A November Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Americans would get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 50 percent in September. If enough people are willing to get inoculated and health care facilities have enough supplies and coordination to inoculate them, the effective end of the pandemic in the US could be months away, not years.

A leading vaccine must be kept very, very cold

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely be the first to receive emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and Moderna is expected to be next. While Moderna’s vaccine can be kept in a regular refrigerator for up to a month, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius, a fact that creates some major challenges for distribution.

For shipping and short-term storage, Pfizer has built packaging equipped with a cooling system that can keep the vaccine cold for up to 30 days if it’s refilled with dry ice every five days. This system also includes a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of the shipment. The Pfizer vaccine can also be stored in ultra-low-temperature freezers for up to six months.

Companies that supply such freezers have been working hard to meet the surge in demand. While many hospitals already have ultra-cold freezers, they’re typically used for other medical purposes, which means that hospitals need more. “Right now, we are out of everything,” an executive of So-Low Environmental Equipment, one of the makers of these freezers, told CNBC in November.

Alex Esmon of Thermo Fisher Scientific, which also makes ultra-low-temperature freezers, told Recode that the company started preparing for a surge in demand earlier this year and that orders have grown at least two-fold since then. He points out that thousands of doses can be stored in a relatively small freezer, which means that health care facilities can calibrate what cooling supplies they need based on how many people they expect to inoculate in a given time period.

“It doesn’t necessarily require a huge build-out,” Esmon explained. “It requires the right build-out based on what each clinic and hospital system determines is going to be their need.”

And then there’s the need for dry ice, both for Pfizer’s custom vaccine packaging and for other types of freezers that rely on the material. Dry ice companies have expressed some caution about the supply of carbon dioxide that they rely on, as there was a shortage of the compound earlier this year. While some of these providers say they’re fine for now, they don’t know what will happen once a vaccine receives authorization, but they anticipate a surge in demand.

“Right now we have a great supply chain of CO2, which is beautiful for us because we haven’t let down any of our customers in the last six months,” Marc Savenor, the CEO of the company Acme Dry Ice, told Recode. He added that his company is already hearing from transportation and pharmaceutics companies for advance orders.

Still, the unique temperature needs of the Pfizer vaccine necessitates some thinking ahead from facilities that will distribute it. The cooling requirements could make it harder to distribute in rural areas, and even some hospitals don’t yet have enough infrastructure to keep it cold.

Those planning to distribute the Pfizer vaccine have to decide between investing in ultra-low-temperature freezers, or buying lots and lots of dry ice, according to Jessica Daley, a supply chain expert at the health care supplier Premier. And as health care facilities consider the requirements of the first vaccine available, there are likely others down the line that will have different needs.

A Covid-19 vaccine means glass vials — and new alternatives

Anticipation of a vaccine has also boosted demand for pharmaceutical glass to make vials that will hold and protect doses while they’re being transported and stored. Vials are important because they allow for the shipment of multiple shots of a vaccine in the same container. These vials can’t be too big, because once they’re opened, the vaccine inside can spoil quickly. So we need a lot of vials.

Over the summer, there was enough concern about a shortage of vials that the German company Schott, the world’s largest producer of pharmaceutical glass, denied requests from drugmakers to reserve its borosilicate glass in advance. (Borosilicate is a type of glass that can protect the vaccine from contamination — like tiny glass particles — and high temperatures.) Schott says it made three out of every four glass vials used in all three stages of vaccine trials, and in preparation for a vaccine, the company aims to produce enough vials for 2 billion vaccinations. The Italian firm Stevanato Group, which also aims to produce enough glass for 2 billion doses, and the German company Gerrescheimer, have also committed to supplying pharmaceutical glass for vaccine containers.

US companies are also producing alternatives as protection against bottlenecks. For several years, the New York-based glass manufacturer Corning has been working on a novel type of pharmaceutical glass, but the pandemic has given the novel material new promise. Valor Glass is supposed to be stronger than borosilicate glass, and less likely to produce cracks that can affect the sterility of a vaccine dose. (Corning also produces borosilicate glass tubing as well as Gorilla Glass, which is used for smartphone screens.)

In June, Corning received a $200 million contract from the US government to expand production of Valor Glass. The company now plans to produce an extra 164 million vials annually by the end of 2021, which would be 10 times what it produced before the pandemic, according to Brendan Mosher, the vice president and general manager of Corning’s pharmaceutical glass business.

Another alternative is from SiO2 Materials Science, which makes medical-grade containers out of plastic that have a very thin coating of pure silica, the primary ingredient in most glass. The material can withstand incredibly cold temperatures, is lighter than traditional glass, and is less likely to break, SiO2’s chief business officer Lawrence Ganti told Recode. These high-tech vials are already being used by Moderna and other companies that make Covid-19 treatments. A $143 million contract with the federal government helped SiO2 Materials Science add hundreds more employees, and Ganti says the company will be producing vials for about 200 million doses every month by 2021.

Vaccines require lots of syringes and needles

When vials full of doses are delivered to and unpackaged at their facilities, health care workers will use needles and syringes to remove the dose from the container and inject the vaccine into patients. Across the US and the world, this will require an incredible number of syringes and needles.

Over the summer, Trump administration trade and manufacturing policy director Peter Navarro warned that it could take up to two years to manufacture enough syringes and needles to distribute a coronavirus vaccine nationwide. In a whistleblower complaint, vaccine expert Rick Bright also warned that the Strategic National Stockpile only had 15 million syringes and later urged members of Congress to boost the government’s supply. The country, the experts said, would need hundreds of millions of needles.

The government has ramped up the production of syringes and needles in the intervening months. The Department of Defense has spent $100 million to secure more syringes and safety needles in a deal meant to provide over 500 million safety syringes within a year to the Strategic National Stockpile. The federal government also loaned nearly $600 million to a Connecticut-based company called ApiJect, which produces pre-filled syringes that serve as an alternative to the standard methods of injection. This particular device hasn’t been used before — a fact that has prompted some confusion and concern, especially since the device has yet to be approved by the FDA.

Meanwhile, health care supplier McKesson has been charged by the federal government with assembling vaccine kits, which include needles and syringes, for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on behalf of the Strategic National Stockpile. The government is also working with Becton, Dickinson, and Company, also known as BD, which is one of the world’s largest producers of syringes and needles. BD aims to supply the government with 286 million syringes by early spring, many of which will be sent to McKesson to be included in the US supply of vaccine kits.

“This is a wonderful solution for providers because all of those little things that, like you said, you don’t often think about — the alcohol wipes, the Band-Aids, the syringes, the needles — those things will be provided in those kits,” Daley, the supply chain expert at Premier, told Recode, adding that they don’t anticipate a shortage of syringes.

Still, BD has also warned buyers not to stockpile or buy more than they need, and that health care providers planning to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine should not order injection devices on their own. But the company’s senior vice president for public affairs, Elizabeth Woody, expressed confidence in the plans, saying that the company felt prepared for the pandemic in part because of its experience with the H1N1 outbreak.

“We got a flavor of what might be required at a time like this,” Woody told Recode. “Since the start of the Covid pandemic, we’ve been working around the clock, discussing our needs with governments across the globe, and really running our needle and syringe production lines 24/7.”

The task of distributing vaccines to hundreds of millions of people is daunting

Taking all of the needed materials into account — freezers, glass vials, syringes, needles — there’s still a lot of anxiety around making sure that the vaccine ends up in the right place at the right time. No one wants vaccine doses to go to waste.

While Pfizer will distribute its own vaccine, McKesson will handle the distribution of the vaccine from Moderna once it’s approved. But there are other key players that are preparing for their role in vaccine distribution. Airlines are bracing to start moving the vaccine, even turning to passenger planes that have been grounded by low demand during the pandemic. Shippers like FedEx, UPS, and DHL are all preparing for deliveries, and some are boosting freezer storage while also balancing the demands of holiday season online shopping.

Once the vaccine arrives, there’s another hurdle before injection. Depending on their area and resources, local health facilities could vary widely in their ability to get vaccines to patients.

“My concern is there may not be enough storage capacity or staff to be able to vaccinate at the desired rate,” Northwestern professor Hani Mahmassani told Recode. “There’s a myriad of little things that can go wrong at that level, and you may not have the health care infrastructure to deliver.”

The second dose also presents unique challenges: Vaccine distributors injecting patients with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine need to be meticulous about which patients receive which vaccine, and keep track of who needs a booster shot just a few weeks later. Meditech, one prominent provider of electronic health records in the US, is working on providing a certificate to patients as they receive the first and second dose, for instance. US health officials have also said that people who get vaccinated will receive “vaccine cards,” harking back to the idea of immunity passports discussed earlier this year.

But that means that even if all the supply chains for delivering vaccines and supplies hold up, the greatest challenge will still be logistical: getting the right people to show up and receive the vaccine — and a necessary booster — at the right time. For health care facilities, that will mean a high level of coordination and meticulous tracking. There’s understandable fear that that might be a far-fetched goal, too. Nearly a year into the pandemic, Covid-19 testing is still crippled by long lines, delays, and confusion.

Even if the supply chain holds and the distribution of the vaccine goes off without a hitch, the public has to be willing to take the vaccine and get their booster shots in the right time frame. Large numbers of people need to be inoculated for the US population to reach herd immunity.

“If only 40 percent of the population gets vaccinated, this thing will not disappear,” said Hughes, the air cargo expert at IATA. Otherwise, he added, the vaccine is “a bit like a fire break when you have a wildfire.” It might slow the spread, but it won’t save the forest.

2020-12-07 15:14:50+00:00,7,"President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has tested positive for the coronavirus.

Giuliani “has tested positive for the China Virus,” Trump tweeted, using the racist term he habitually uses for the coronavirus. “Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!”

.@RudyGiuliani, by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus. Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2020

Giuliani’s positive test comes roughly two weeks after his son tested positive. It’s unclear how and when Giuliani contracted the virus.

Giuliani has been traveling constantly across the country in recent weeks, leading Trump’s failing legal efforts to contest the results of the 2020 presidential election, and has been in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona — all states with high virus case numbers — in the past two weeks. He has been in contact with members of Trump’s legal team in recent days, as well as witnesses incorrectly alleging voting improprieties, and Michigan lawmakers.

On Wednesday, he participated in testimony falsely claiming that votes were illegally cast in Michigan in an indoor, largely maskless session before Michigan’s House Oversight Committee. Depending on when Giuliani was infected, those in attendance may be at risk of exposure.

The president did not say on Sunday whether Giuliani is symptomatic, or if he plans to isolate to avoid infecting others with Covid-19. At 76 years old and male, he is in a group considered to be at greater risk for complications and more negative outcomes of the disease.

Giuliani is the latest of many figures and staffers in the president’s orbit to contract the coronavirus, including Trump himself, much of the president’s family, his chief of staff, multiple senior advisers, and the White House press secretary. All together, more than a dozen people in the president’s personal orbit have tested positive since October.

Some of this spread has been attributed to the fact that Trump’s inner circle has routinely declined to wear masks and abide by social distancing protocols. For instance, the president has held a number of large, maskless indoor events — including a party celebrating Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. That party was labeled a superspreader event by top federal infectious disease expert and national coronavirus task force member Anthony Fauci.

Giuliani has participated in a number of these sorts of high-risk events, from the hearing on Wednesday to a rally the former mayor held for Trump ahead of the election. Like many on the president’s team, Giuliani has not shown strong support for precautions like mask-wearing; in October, Giuliani criticized President-elect Joe Biden for his mask-wearing habit and said that his use of them was meant to induce fear.

“It isn’t science to be wearing that mask, Joe, when you are giving a speech and people are 30-40 feet away from you,” Giuliani said during an interview with Fox News. “The only thing you can infect is the teleprompter that’s near you. So, I see through you. That’s a political statement to scare people, wearing that mask. You do not need that mask when you are standing at a podium.”",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'president', 'latest', 'giuliani', 'virus', 'rudy', 'coronavirus', 'positive', 'presidents', 'weeks', 'tested', 'trumps', 'associate']",0
2020-12-05 22:54:46+00:00,31,"In July and August, the Australian state of Victoria was going through a second Covid-19 wave. Local leaders set an improbable goal in the face of that challenge. They didn’t want to just get their Covid-19 numbers down. They wanted to eliminate the virus entirely.

By the end of November, they’d done it.

They have seen no active cases for a full four weeks. Melbourne, the state’s capital and a city with about as many people as the greater Washington, DC, area, is now completely coronavirus-free.

Australia enjoyed plenty of advantages over the United States in containing Covid-19. It has no land borders to speak of. Its population density is very low (though the population is concentrated on the coasts). Its outbreak never got nearly as bad as the US’s did. On its worst days, Victoria saw about 700 new cases; Missouri, with (very roughly) a similar population and landmass, is currently averaging more than 3,000. Some of the Australian states also closed their borders to the others, which lowered the risk somebody might bring Covid-19 from one part of the country to another.

But the Australian epidemic has also mirrored America’s in important ways. Once the coronavirus arrived in the spring, the country went into lockdown. When cases abated, some of those restrictions were eased — and, before too long, Covid-19 cases were spiking again. Each state was responsible for its own response, with the federal government playing an advisory role outside of obviously national issues like foreign travel.

In the second wave, Victoria was by far the hardest-hit state. Its case numbers were dwarfing those in every other state including New South Wales, home to the country’s other great metropolis, Sydney.

Policymakers dreaded an endless cycle of lockdown-reopening-lockdown — exactly the situation the US finds itself in. They realized that amorphous goals of “slowing the spread” or “flattening the curve” had been ineffective in mustering public support for the stringent mitigation measures that would be necessary to contain the virus.

So they went big. The state’s roadmap largely followed a policy proposal laid out in September by the Grattan Institute (a nonprofit think tank supported by the state and federal governments): “Go for zero.”

The goal was not just to slow Covid-19 down. It was to eradicate the virus. The state had gone into a stage 4 lockdown — most businesses closed, there was a nightly curfew, and residents were ordered to stay within five kilometers of their home — in August, and it was then extended in September, with the explicit goal of eventually reaching zero new cases.

“Ideally, lockdowns are only done once and done well,” the proposal’s authors, Stephen Duckett and Will Mackey, explained. “The benefit of zero is to reduce the risk of ‘yo-yoing’ between virus flare-ups and further lockdowns to contain them.”

They treated the threats to public health and the economy as intertwined, which most experts agree they are. The Australian states that contained Covid-19 best also saw the strongest economic recoveries. Victoria, with the worst outbreak among the states, was lagging behind in consumer spending and business revenue.

People will stay home and spend less if they are worried about the virus. The Grattan authors cited a study comparing Denmark (which established a lockdown) and Sweden (which took a more relaxed “herd immunity” strategy) and found that their economies suffered about the same in the early months of the pandemic. But later in the year, when Denmark had its outbreak under control but Sweden did not, unemployment claims were almost back to pre-Covid levels in the former but remained elevated in the latter.

“Without elimination, the third, fourth, or fifth wave is an inevitability. This will either involve more lockdowns or the government will lose the social license to do lockdowns and the virus will spread indiscriminately,” Duckett told me over email, perhaps unwittingly describing the very challenge before the United States during this winter surge. “A hard lockdown in the early stages of the virus gives a chance for elimination, and that gives the chance for business certainty and a full recovery.”

Melburnians are now enjoying the benefits of their sacrifices. Duckett said he had just gone to lunch with a few friends before responding to my email.

The US probably cannot achieve zero Covid-19 cases anytime soon. But it could embrace the spirit of the Victorian model: a clear goal, support for the proven mitigation strategies, and a commitment from the public.

“Having a clear, uniform goal — that everyone could work toward — was critical to Victoria’s success,” Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “But they didn’t just have a goal. They established the underlying components that were needed and provided strong social support.”

“All of this,” she continued, “has been mostly absent in America.”

There is no secret sauce to Covid-19 containment. It just takes commitment.

There was nothing particularly novel about Victoria’s containment strategy. They just dedicated themselves to what works.

They expanded testing, including random pooled testing and testing for workers in essential industries and of people attending schools or other indoor events. They achieved 24-hour turnarounds for test results, so if a person tested positive, they could quickly isolate. Once cases reached zero, the state was planning to start testing sewage for Covid-19 to get a head start on any resurgence.

The Grattan Institute also recommended ramping up contact tracing, another established part of an effective Covid-19 response, and mandatory isolation. Australia had problems earlier in the year with international travelers breaking their quarantines and introducing the virus into the community. The experts advised having people scan QR codes if they entered any public venues, so they could be contacted if a related case was detected. They also noted that other Australian states had police do spot checks of people who were supposed to be in isolation.

“A system that relies on self-isolation in which people are unable or refuse to self-isolate cannot succeed,” Duckett and Mackey wrote.

That probably sounds draconian to Americans. Certainly, the harshest lockdown measures taken in Victoria — requiring people to stay within a few miles of their house and stay inside completely at night — would be politically challenging in the US.

But Australians took it in stride because they knew the goal they were working toward.

“I think being obedient is definitely part of the Australian psyche,” Eloise Shepherd, who lives in the Melbourne suburbs (and whom I met for our feature on Australian health care published earlier this year), told me over text. “It was really hard, but I’m so grateful we did it.”

The government there made it easier for businesses and workers by providing subsidies to businesses to keep people employed and by increasing their unemployment benefits — the same policies that the US has let lapse and is now struggling to reinstitute even during this devastating winter wave.

As cases dwindled, the lockdown measures were relaxed in a clear, tiered fashion. The extreme travel restrictions were the first to go. Schools and businesses could reopen with spacing. Masks continued to be required indoors and on public transportation. Eventually, all restrictions except for international quarantine could be lifted.

Things could still go wrong for Victoria and the rest of Australia. The state has started prioritizing having “normal” conditions for the Christmas shopping season over maintaining zero new cases. But it is easier to focus on reopening when community spread is eliminated — rather than pushing forward with reopening in spite of sustained spread, as the US has done.

“We know that we’re going to basically have a much easier life now that the pandemic is under control,” Duckett said. “We still celebrate the fact that we’ve had so many days with no new infections and no deaths. The community is very proud of itself.”

Victoria’s Covid-19 restrictions were controversial with some residents, but Australia in general enjoys more political homogeny than the US does. That must make it easier to build solidarity for these extraordinary measures. America is deeply polarized, and that has been reflected in our scattered policy responses and in the differing attitudes of Democrats and Republicans toward mask-wearing and other restrictions.

But I don’t believe it was impossible for America to execute a similar strategy to the one that has succeeded in Victoria. Polls showed most Americans did support wearing masks and other mitigation measures, even if there was some divide among partisans. They worried that social distancing would be relaxed too quickly, not too slowly, much like the Australians did.

The problem, or one of them, is that the US just never set a clear goal for Covid-19 suppression. It was understandably hard to ask people in Wisconsin to abide by social distancing restrictions back when they thought the coronavirus was just a New York City problem — and when they didn’t know what the plan was.

Today, of course, the pandemic is a very real problem for every American. So as we try to bring the winter wave under control, we might benefit from taking a lesson from the Aussies and coming up with a specific objective that all of us, together, can work toward.",voxdotcom,"['lockdown', 'melbourne', 'virus', 'covid19', 'state', 'victoria', 'goal', 'states', 'eradicated', 'australian', 'cases', 'zero']",0
2020-12-05 16:47:51+00:00,29,"Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, toured North Dakota this fall, as the state was overwhelmed by one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the country. While she commended the state’s testing efforts, she was distraught by the noticeable lack of face masks in public spaces. “This is the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,” she said at an October 26 press conference.

North Dakota, which at the time didn’t require masks, had the lowest mask-wearing rate in the country in October, according to survey data.

North Dakota is not the only state that lagged in a mask policy in the throes of a major outbreak, however: Eight of the top 10 states that saw the highest new cases per capita in October did not have a widespread mask mandate, as the chart below shows. (Several of these Great Plains and Midwestern states were spared significant outbreaks of the virus until the fall.)

But the dramatic surge of Covid-19 across the country this fall and winter has forced some states to change course. On November 8, Utah implemented a mask mandate, as new daily Covid-19 cases continue to rise in the state and across the country. Several other states have implemented or tightened mandates since then, including Iowa and North Dakota. Thirty-seven states now have mandates, according to the AARP.

And on December 4, the CDC issued a new recommendation that people wear masks indoors at all times, unless they are at home.

Over the course of the pandemic, America has been engaged in a massive and uncontrolled mask experiment: Some jurisdictions implemented and enforced mask mandates; others rejected them as public health guidance became politicized. President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned and even scorned the use of masks, and several Republican governors have followed his lead. President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, has called for a national mask mandate and for Americans to wear masks for the “first 100 days” he is in office, as vaccines roll out.

But the different state-level approaches mean researchers can now parse the results of a trial they never would have received approval to conduct. New research from Kansas and Tennessee suggests that not only do mask mandates prevent Covid-19 spread, they may also blunt the severity of illness and reduce the number of serious cases that require hospitalization. Other findings support the argument more and more public health experts are making: that masks remain among our cheapest most effective tools to control the pandemic — if worn consistently.

“If you’re not in the ICU, the only tools at our disposal that we know work are the tried-and-true public health measures, like social distancing, hand-washing, and masks,” says Vin Gupta, a critical care pulmonologist and affiliate assistant professor for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “We’re bearing the brunt of those things being implemented poorly.”

“You’re less likely to get Covid-19 if you’re wearing a mask,” says Donna Ginther, an economist and director of the Institute for Policy and Social Research at the University of Kansas. And “even if you do get sick while wearing a mask, you’re less likely to get deathly ill.”

Let’s walk through some of the latest research on mask mandates and what it means as we head into one of the most perilous seasons in the pandemic so far.

New evidence from Kansas and Tennessee that mask mandates control the spread of Covid-19

One intriguing piece of evidence of the effect of mask mandates on controlling the spread of the virus comes from Kansas. In July, Laura Kelly, the Democratic governor of Kansas, issued a mandate requiring everyone in public places to wear a mask where 6 feet of social distancing couldn’t be maintained. It prompted an immediate outcry from conservatives. Because of a state law passed in June that allowed counties to supersede the governor’s emergency powers, 81 counties out of 105 opted out of the mask mandate altogether, and only 21 counties decided to enforce it.

Two researchers from the University of Kansas analyzed what happened next.

Ginther, the economist working on this analysis, found that in the counties that enforced mask-wearing, new cases stayed roughly steady. But in the counties without mandates, even after controlling for how often people left their homes, they doubled. “We were stunned by the strength of the effect,” she says.

The public health officer of Johnson, the state’s largest county, was so impressed he asked Ginther to share her work with the Board of County Commissioners, even though it’s not yet peer-reviewed or even written up into a paper. She is currently working on publishing the results.

Ginther says it wasn’t until 12 weeks after the mandates took effect that the growth in cases began to slow. But she thinks her results are likely conservative. “A 50 percent reduction in cases is likely to be a lower-bound on the true effect of wearing a mask,” she says. “If you had 100 percent compliance, I would expect to see an even larger effect.”

Other researchers have made related findings. A nonprofit group called Prevent Epidemics recently published a report showing that, following mask mandates, coronavirus cases declined in Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. The CDC found that in Arizona, after a mask mandate was put in place, Covid-19 cases dropped 75 percent. Conversely, cases spiked 151 percent when stay-at-home orders were lifted, demonstrating that behavior has a significant impact on viral transmission.

In addition to slowing the spread of the virus, new evidence from Tennessee shows that mask mandates could reduce the severity of the virus. A paper by researchers at Vanderbilt found that at Tennessee hospitals where at least 75 percent of Covid-19 patients came from counties with mask requirements, coronavirus hospitalization rates are the same as they were in July. In hospitals where fewer than 25 percent of patients come from places with a mask mandate, hospitalizations are 200 percent higher. What’s more, the researchers wrote, hospitals in areas with mask requirements and other mitigation strategies “are in a much better position to serve the entire spectrum of community health needs, not just Covid-19 patients.”

Mask mandates lead to more people wearing masks

Even if they aren’t always followed, mask mandates appear to be an effective tool in encouraging behavior change. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington found in August that mask use increased 8 percentage points after mask mandates, and increased 15 points if those mandates were enforced.

Only around 65 percent of Americans currently regularly wear masks, according to IHME. But in Singapore, for instance, around 95 percent of people wear masks, and they have one of the world’s lowest coronavirus death rates. “We know that countries that wear masks are doing much better,” says Ali Mokdad, the chief strategy officer of public health at the University of Washington.

Thirty-three states and Washington, DC, implemented statewide mask mandates between April and August. During the same period, an increasing number of Americans began to wear masks regularly, according to a weekly survey started in mid-April by the data intelligence company Premise.

There is one caveat of all the analyses mentioned above: They simply observe behavior, which means that they can demonstrate associations — like case counts falling after mask mandates are put in place — but not causation. The gold standard to prove that would be a randomized controlled trial. But that’s a hard study to design in a pandemic because of ethical concerns.

Even without randomized trials, Rebekah Gee, a public health policy expert and secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health, says the body of evidence “confirms what public health experts have known since early on in this pandemic, which is that masks work.”

Masks could save 130,000 lives by February, but more Americans would have to wear them consistently

In fact, a study published October 23 in Nature Medicine by IHME’s forecasting team modeled current public health interventions — projecting case numbers based on current behavior — and found that universal mask use could save as many as 130,000 lives by the end of February 2021.

Mokdad says that’s why it’s essential to have clear, consistent recommendations to wear masks. He adds, “We never debate seatbelts. Is it okay if only 80 percent of people wear them? We say everybody should.” But while he would prefer that 100 percent of people wear masks, Mokdad says at this point, any incremental increase in mask use “for me is a celebration.”

Unfortunately, in many parts of the US, mask use is actually decreasing. In Florida, for example, which grappled with a serious surge in cases this summer, Mokdad says 70 percent of people were wearing masks in August. Now, only 65 percent are. “Wearing masks has been a response to fear rather than a good, persistent behavior,” Mokdad says.

Vox analyzed the relationship between the frequency of wearing masks from the Premise survey data and the Covid-19 cases in states from April to October. As the charts below show, in states with mandates where cases surged in the spring, more people now wear masks. These states — where more people consistently wear masks — are now less likely to see another huge surge in cases.

Even though mask use has risen in many states, the nation as a whole is on a troubling trajectory, with new daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths all on the rise. Mokdad says he’s very concerned about the holidays. “As we go be with our loved ones — our grandparents, our kids — do you want to go sit at a table and risk the people you care about most, or do you want to wear a mask?” IHME models predict that if some US states increased their mask use from now on, they could reduce the number of future Covid-19 deaths by about 50 percent.

The stakes for getting this right are high — not just for the holidays, but for the rest of the pandemic, however long that might be.

Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently echoed Biden’s call for a national mask mandate. “If you don’t want to shut down, at least do the fundamental, basic things,” Fauci told the editor-in-chief of JAMA, “the flagship of which is wearing a mask.”

Rather than thinking about a mask mandate as something that takes away a freedom, as anti-mask protestors have claimed, Leana Wen, a physician and the former Health Commissioner for the City of Baltimore, says, “Mask-wearing allows you to do things.” If everyone wears a mask, it will keep transmission low, allowing businesses and schools to stay open.

“If you want a more normal life, we need to adjust our behavior, as opposed to locking ourselves away,” Ginther says. “Masks rise to the top as an approach we can take as a society to have a more open economy but not get everyone sick.”

2020-12-04 21:08:08+00:00,4,"With the already staggering coronavirus case and death toll expected to climb further in the US following Thanksgiving, there’s at least more good news on the vaccine front. The biotech firm Moderna released the final results of its 30,000-person vaccine trial in a press release Monday, reporting a 94.1 percent rate of efficacy. The finding squares with the 94.5 percent efficacy rate the company reported two weeks ago, based on its first interim analysis of trial data.

Of the 196 Covid-19 cases in the trial, 185 were in the placebo group and only 11 in the vaccine group, Moderna reported.

Even more important, the vaccine — called mRNA-1273 — appears to protect against severe disease, not just asymptomatic or mild cases. Of the 30 severe Covid-19 cases among trial participants, all occurred in the placebo group. If the finding is real, it would likely mean averted deaths and hospitalizations when millions of people are immunized.

“You’ve got 100 percent protection against severe disease,” Paul Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told Vox. “That’s remarkable.”

“If these numbers are right, it’s more than we’d need for the vaccine to be a major control measure for this outbreak,” said Eric Rubin, an infectious disease specialist and the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Moderna’s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, said in the press release that the company plans to request an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which would allow the vaccine to be used in limited cases for people facing some of the highest risk of exposure to Covid-19, like health care workers. “We believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death,” he added.

Expect authorization after — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) November 30, 2020

Given that the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford coronavirus vaccine research groups have also put out promising findings recently, this latest announcement of final data from the Moderna trial reaffirms that the world will likely have several highly effective vaccines for Covid-19 — and the end of the pandemic may be on the horizon. High efficacy also means that fewer people would need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, the threshold at which the virus can no longer spread easily from person to person.

But, as always, there are caveats. In this case, the vaccine requires two doses, there are some side effects, and we don’t yet have details about how the vaccine worked in high-risk groups. And while demonstrating efficacy is important, the road to getting millions of people vaccinated will be fraught with logistical challenges. A lot of difficult work on a Covid-19 vaccine still lies ahead.

How Moderna showed that its Covid-19 vaccine works

Moderna’s announcement of 94.1 percent efficacy is based on a phase 3 clinical trial. In particular, the results are from the COVE study, conducted in collaboration with the US government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

Phase 3 is where the vaccine is tested against the virus spreading in the real world. Since experimenters can’t deliberately infect people, they have to wait and see who gets sick with Covid-19 in their volunteer pool, comparing the group that received the actual vaccine to the group that received the placebo. Moderna’s vaccine is administered as two doses.

To speed up the process, researchers recruit thousands of volunteers so that the rate of accumulating infections goes up. But it only takes a handful of infections to demonstrate that the vaccine works.

If a vaccine doesn’t work, and half the people in the trial get the vaccine and the other half get the placebo, we’d expect coronavirus cases to be evenly split in the two groups, Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, told Vox. But when a vaccine is effective, we get results like the ones Moderna is reporting.

According to the biotech firm, experimenters detected 11 cases in people who received two doses of the vaccine compared to 185 in the placebo group. This shows that the virus was spreading among volunteers in the clinical trial but was drastically lower among those who received Moderna’s vaccine. “When we think about the level of evidence, this is a strong result,” Dean said.

There are some caveats to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine results

Moderna’s latest results were announced in a press release, and came directly from the company. While there have been several peer-reviewed interim studies about its vaccine, Monday’s announcement of final results didn’t arrive with any published data — just like the November 16 announcement of interim results.

Caution: this is a press release not a scientific paper. Looking forward to more detailed efficacy and safety data e.g. https://t.co/DQctLPM0li — Saad B. Omer (@SaadOmer3) November 16, 2020

That doesn’t mean the findings are wrong, but they lack critical details and nuances we need to interpret them — like how well the vaccine works if people get only one dose (not an unlikely scenario in the real world) and how effective it is in high-risk groups.

We don’t know anything on the former, and on the latter, Moderna has only reported that “efficacy was consistent across age, race and ethnicity, and gender demographics.” While the company provided numbers for how many trial participants were over 65 and from various ethnic communities, the company didn’t say how the vaccine performed in each of these subgroups. That information is critical, since these are the people who’ve been hardest hit by the virus.

We also don’t yet know how long people who got the vaccine remain protected from the virus, Dean pointed out. There are also the side effects to consider. Moderna has reported no serious safety issues to date and said that most problems tended to be mild to moderate — but up to 10 percent of participants experienced severe side effects, according to an earlier press release. These included fatigue (9.7 percent), muscle pain (8.9 percent), joint pain (5.2 percent), headache (4.5 percent), other pain (4.1 percent), and redness at the injection site (2 percent).

Since the vaccines will ultimately have to be distributed to millions, if not billions, of people, it’s important to pay attention to side effects. Rare complications will be more likely to show up once lots of people get the shot. And clinical trials of other Covid-19 vaccine candidates — like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine — have already been paused due to complications among recipients.

What happens next for a Covid-19 vaccine

If the Moderna vaccine receives emergency approval in the US, distribution could begin in December. Bancel, the Moderna CEO, told Science that the company plans to charge $32 to $37 per dose of the vaccine in developed countries. But while the company says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of 2020 for the US market, distributing the vaccine will be challenging.

Moderna’s vaccine requires long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s well within the temperature range of conventional refrigerators and warmer than the temperature requirements of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, but it may still pose a logistical hurdle in some lower-resource settings, like rural hospitals, that lack certain kinds of cold storage facilities.

Moderna’s is also a two-dose vaccine, which means every recipient needs to come back for a second injection to get that high rate of efficacy. We know from other multi-dose vaccines that not everybody will return for that second shot — and the efficacy profile may look different. “When you do an experiment, it’s done under best conditions,” Offit said. “When things roll out in the real world, in real-world conditions, there’s a fraying.”

It’s also important to remember that an effective vaccine is not enough to end the pandemic quickly. Measures like social distancing, practicing good hygiene, and wearing face masks will remain essential to control the spread of Covid-19 until a vaccine is widely available. Public acceptance may also be an issue, and health officials will have to overcome a rising wave of vaccine hesitancy.

Vaccine research also doesn’t end once a vaccine is rolled out. Public health officials, doctors, and the biotech companies will still have to track complications across millions of people and pay attention to how quickly immunity wanes.

So far, we have two months of safety data after the second dose, and while that’s not long-term, it should build confidence, Offit said. “Serious side effects usually shot up within six weeks of the second dose. 260,000 people have died this year in the US [of Covid-19]. It would be great if we could do a three- to four-year study and look at length of efficacy and the duration of efficacy. But the question isn’t when do you know everything here — it’s when do you know enough.”",voxdotcom,"['group', 'moderna', 'theyre', 'covid19', 'company', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'encouraging', 'released', 'placebo', 'results', 'severe', 'cases']",0
2020-12-04 21:08:08+00:00,6,"The United Kingdom on Wednesday granted temporary authorization for emergency use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to adults age 16 and older, with the first 800,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine slated to be offered in the country next week.

This makes the UK the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine and the first government approval of a vaccine backed by a clinical trial. (Some countries like Russia and China began administering their Covid-19 vaccines before completing large-scale trials.) It’s also the fastest a vaccine has ever gained approval, albeit on a temporary basis.

“I’m confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onward, things are going to be better,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock during a press conference. “And we’re going to have summer next year that everyone can enjoy.”

The UK’s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), granted the temporary authorization shortly after Pfizer and BioNTech reported in November that their Covid-19 vaccine was 95 percent effective. Though this is a temporary authorization, the MHRA is conducting a rolling review of vaccine trial data as it comes in and may grant full approval at a later date. In contrast, the US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating vaccines based on completed studies, which increases the length of the approval process.

The UK government reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech to purchase 40 million doses of the vaccine through 2021 — enough for 20 million people — mainly shipped from Pfizer’s manufacturing plant in Puurs, Belgium.

“This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in a statement.

The UK has been one of the most severely afflicted countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, with 1.6 million reported infections and almost 60,000 deaths in a population of 66 million. The government recently imposed a second national lockdown as cases spiked; restrictions on movement and which businesses can stay open may begin to relax this week as the number of new cases declines. But with winter approaching, the risk of more Covid-19 spread in the UK remains high.

The UK is prioritizing older adults to receive a Covid-19 vaccine

With limited doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to give out for the time being, the UK is establishing several priority tiers for Covid-19 immunization.

The country’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Wednesday laid out guidelines for administering the vaccine based mainly on age. The top priority is residents and workers at care homes for older adults, a ranking based on the number of vaccinations that would be needed in each tier to prevent one death, not necessarily risk of exposure.

That’s why health workers, who will be at the front of the line in the US, are not in the top tier in the UK, even though they may be encountering the virus more frequently. “As the risk of mortality from COVID-19 increases with age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,” according to the guidelines.

The committee divided its overall priority list into nine groups. “It is estimated that taken together, these groups represent around 99% of preventable mortality from COVID-19,” according to the JCVI guidelines.

But the guidelines also note that vaccine deployment strategies may have to shift to address concerns like mitigating health inequalities and logistical challenges. The latter is particularly important for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine because it has some of the most stringent cold storage requirements of any Covid-19 vaccine candidate: temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower. While Pfizer and BioNTech are developing shipping containers that can maintain these temperatures for 30 days, it’s likely that the first facilities to receive it will be major health facilities that already have freezers.

Recipients will have to receive the vaccine as two doses spaced 21 days apart, so rigorous patient tracking will be needed as well.

The US is now waiting on emergency approval for two Covid-19 vaccines

Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week voted on US guidelines for vaccine approval. The recommendations from the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices stated that health workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be up first for a Covid-19 vaccine. That health workers are in the top tier stands in contrast to the guidelines issued by the UK.

Establishing these priorities is all the more critical now that a vaccine is poised to begin distribution in the US in weeks. Pfizer and BioNTech have also applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US from the FDA for their Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA is meeting on December 10 to discuss their vaccine. This week, Moderna, another mRNA Covid-19 vaccine developer, also applied for an EUA.

If granted, these emergency approvals would mark the fastest vaccine development timeline ever, an amazing feat against an unprecedented pandemic. But Covid-19 cases are continuing to rise across the US, and it will still be a few more months before there is widespread access to a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['older', 'approves', 'authorization', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'adults', 'biontech', 'approval', 'workers', 'pfizer', 'temporary', 'care', 'pfizerbiontechs', 'homes', 'uk']",0
2020-12-04 20:00:14+00:00,48,"In July and August, the Australian state of Victoria was going through a second Covid-19 wave. Local leaders set an improbable goal in the face of that challenge. They didn’t want to just get their Covid-19 numbers down. They wanted to eliminate the virus entirely.

By the end of November, they’d done it.

They have seen no active cases for a full four weeks. Melbourne, the state’s capital and a city with about as many people as the greater Washington, DC, area, is now completely coronavirus-free.

Australia enjoyed plenty of advantages over the United States in containing Covid-19. It has no land borders to speak of. Its population density is very low (though the population is concentrated on the coasts). Its outbreak never got nearly as bad as the US’s did. On its worst days, Victoria saw about 700 new cases; Missouri, with (very roughly) a similar population and landmass, is currently averaging more than 3,000. Some of the Australian states also closed their borders to the others, which lowered the risk somebody might bring Covid-19 from one part of the country to another.

But the Australian epidemic has also mirrored America’s in important ways. Once the coronavirus arrived in the spring, the country went into lockdown. When cases abated, some of those restrictions were eased — and, before too long, Covid-19 cases were spiking again. Each state was responsible for its own response, with the federal government playing an advisory role outside of obviously national issues like foreign travel.

In the second wave, Victoria was by far the hardest-hit state. Its case numbers were dwarfing those in every other state including New South Wales, home to the country’s other great metropolis, Sydney.

Policymakers dreaded an endless cycle of lockdown-reopening-lockdown — exactly the situation the US finds itself in. They realized that amorphous goals of “slowing the spread” or “flattening the curve” had been ineffective in mustering public support for the stringent mitigation measures that would be necessary to contain the virus.

So they went big. The state’s roadmap largely followed a policy proposal laid out in September by the Grattan Institute (a nonprofit think tank supported by the state and federal governments): “Go for zero.”

The goal was not just to slow Covid-19 down. It was to eradicate the virus. The state had gone into a stage 4 lockdown — most businesses closed, there was a nightly curfew, and residents were ordered to stay within five kilometers of their home — in August, and it was then extended in September, with the explicit goal of eventually reaching zero new cases.

“Ideally, lockdowns are only done once and done well,” the proposal’s authors, Stephen Duckett and Will Mackey, explained. “The benefit of zero is to reduce the risk of ‘yo-yoing’ between virus flare-ups and further lockdowns to contain them.”

They treated the threats to public health and the economy as intertwined, which most experts agree they are. The Australian states that contained Covid-19 best also saw the strongest economic recoveries. Victoria, with the worst outbreak among the states, was lagging behind in consumer spending and business revenue.

People will stay home and spend less if they are worried about the virus. The Grattan authors cited a study comparing Denmark (which established a lockdown) and Sweden (which took a more relaxed “herd immunity” strategy) and found that their economies suffered about the same in the early months of the pandemic. But later in the year, when Denmark had its outbreak under control but Sweden did not, unemployment claims were almost back to pre-Covid levels in the former but remained elevated in the latter.

“Without elimination, the third, fourth, or fifth wave is an inevitability. This will either involve more lockdowns or the government will lose the social license to do lockdowns and the virus will spread indiscriminately,” Duckett told me over email, perhaps unwittingly describing the very challenge before the United States during this winter surge. “A hard lockdown in the early stages of the virus gives a chance for elimination, and that gives the chance for business certainty and a full recovery.”

Melburnians are now enjoying the benefits of their sacrifices. Duckett said he had just gone to lunch with a few friends before responding to my email.

The US probably cannot achieve zero Covid-19 cases anytime soon. But it could embrace the spirit of the Victorian model: a clear goal, support for the proven mitigation strategies, and a commitment from the public.

“Having a clear, uniform goal — that everyone could work toward — was critical to Victoria’s success,” Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “But they didn’t just have a goal. They established the underlying components that were needed and provided strong social support.”

“All of this,” she continued, “has been mostly absent in America.”

There is no secret sauce to Covid-19 containment. It just takes commitment.

There was nothing particularly novel about Victoria’s containment strategy. They just dedicated themselves to what works.

They expanded testing, including random pooled testing and testing for workers in essential industries and of people attending schools or other indoor events. They achieved 24-hour turnarounds for test results, so if a person tested positive, they could quickly isolate. Once cases reached zero, the state was planning to start testing sewage for Covid-19 to get a head start on any resurgence.

The Grattan Institute also recommended ramping up contact tracing, another established part of an effective Covid-19 response, and mandatory isolation. Australia had problems earlier in the year with international travelers breaking their quarantines and introducing the virus into the community. The experts advised having people scan QR codes if they entered any public venues, so they could be contacted if a related case was detected. They also noted that other Australian states had police do spot checks of people who were supposed to be in isolation.

“A system that relies on self-isolation in which people are unable or refuse to self-isolate cannot succeed,” Duckett and Mackey wrote.

That probably sounds draconian to Americans. Certainly, the harshest lockdown measures taken in Victoria — requiring people to stay within a few miles of their house and stay inside completely at night — would be politically challenging in the US.

But Australians took it in stride because they knew the goal they were working toward.

“I think being obedient is definitely part of the Australian psyche,” Eloise Shepherd, who lives in the Melbourne suburbs (and whom I met for our feature on Australian health care published earlier this year), told me over text. “It was really hard, but I’m so grateful we did it.”

The government there made it easier for businesses and workers by providing subsidies to businesses to keep people employed and by increasing their unemployment benefits — the same policies that the US has let lapse and is now struggling to reinstitute even during this devastating winter wave.

As cases dwindled, the lockdown measures were relaxed in a clear, tiered fashion. The extreme travel restrictions were the first to go. Schools and businesses could reopen with spacing. Masks continued to be required indoors and on public transportation. Eventually, all restrictions except for international quarantine could be lifted.

Things could still go wrong for Victoria and the rest of Australia. The state has started prioritizing having “normal” conditions for the Christmas shopping season over maintaining zero new cases. But it is easier to focus on reopening when community spread is eliminated — rather than pushing forward with reopening in spite of sustained spread, as the US has done.

“We know that we’re going to basically have a much easier life now that the pandemic is under control,” Duckett said. “We still celebrate the fact that we’ve had so many days with no new infections and no deaths. The community is very proud of itself.”

Victoria’s Covid-19 restrictions were controversial with some residents, but Australia in general enjoys more political homogeny than the US does. That must make it easier to build solidarity for these extraordinary measures. America is deeply polarized, and that has been reflected in our scattered policy responses and in the differing attitudes of Democrats and Republicans toward mask-wearing and other restrictions.

But I don’t believe it was impossible for America to execute a similar strategy to the one that has succeeded in Victoria. Polls showed most Americans did support wearing masks and other mitigation measures, even if there was some divide among partisans. They worried that social distancing would be relaxed too quickly, not too slowly, much like the Australians did.

The problem, or one of them, is that the US just never set a clear goal for Covid-19 suppression. It was understandably hard to ask people in Wisconsin to abide by social distancing restrictions back when they thought the coronavirus was just a New York City problem — and when they didn’t know what the plan was.

Today, of course, the pandemic is a very real problem for every American. So as we try to bring the winter wave under control, we might benefit from taking a lesson from the Aussies and coming up with a specific objective that all of us, together, can work toward.",voxdotcom,"['lockdown', 'melbourne', 'virus', 'covid19', 'state', 'victoria', 'goal', 'states', 'eradicated', 'australian', 'cases', 'zero']",0
2020-12-03 19:30:43+00:00,20,"On December 2, a staggering 2,885 Americans were reported to have died of Covid-19, according to the New York Times. It was the highest single-day toll of the year.

It was nearly the same number of people who died in the 9/11 attacks (2,977). And it was far more than the estimated 1,800 Americans who died over a matter of days when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. During World War II, from the Pearl Harbor attacks in December 1941 to Japan’s surrender, about 300 US soldiers died every day on average (and about 407,000 were dead in total by August 1945).

Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has more in common with a slow-motion tragedy, like a war, than an acute event like 9/11. More than 2,600 deaths were reported on December 1, the day before the US set its new record for daily deaths; the previous high had been 2,752 on April 15. With the number of daily new cases and hospitalizations still rising across the country, public health experts expect new terrible death records will be set over the coming winter.

Coronavirus pandemic metrics are slippery things, however. America was so bad at testing during the first few months of the virus’s spread that there were likely quite a few cases and deaths that were caused by Covid-19 but were not counted as such. Even today, the US positive test rate is so high that experts say the statistics aren’t coming close to capturing every case or death.

According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the official number of total deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the US is 274,121. But total excess deaths — the number of deaths above what would be expected in a normal year — has reached 345,000, according to the Times. Most, though not all, of those deaths are likely uncounted Covid-19 fatalities.

At a certain point, this is all academic. What’s undeniable is that America is entering a period of mass death unlike anything we’ve seen so far in the pandemic. Cases and hospitalizations have been rising steadily, and deaths always follow. Improvements in treatment have lowered the fatality rate, but a higher number of hospitalized patients will inevitably mean more deaths. And it is older, low-income, and minority Americans who are dying at disproportionate rates from the coronavirus.

The US also set a new single-day record for current hospitalizations on December 2, topping 100,000 for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Hospitals all across the nation are under tremendous strain.

The US is going to lose a lot more people before the Covid-19 pandemic ends

As hospital beds fill up and staff is stretched thin, the likelihood of losing people who otherwise might have survived under normal circumstances increases.

Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, explained the risks in a recent Twitter thread. He started by pointing out that the percentage of new Covid-19 cases who end up in the hospital is actually shrinking. That would suggest people who would have been hospitalized earlier in the year are now being turned away from the emergency room or asked to stay at home because they’re not yet in critical condition.

Some of this is good public health practice — you want to keep beds open for the sickest patients — but it also creates a situation where somebody who’s at the margins could be denied entry to the hospital and their condition might deteriorate more quickly at home.

Everything — COVID and non-COVID is affected



So borderline admission for heart failure? Person now goes home



Pt with infected leg where you’d prefer IV antibiotics in hospital? They go home with oral antibiotics



This is what is happening in hospitals across America right now — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) December 1, 2020

Full hospitals could also be left without enough room or staff for patients with other serious conditions, and some of those people could die without access to the medical care they need. They may not die of Covid-19, but they would still be victims of the pandemic.

On Twitter, Kari Jerge, a surgeon in Kansas City, Kansas, described recent dilemmas doctors are facing: a non-Covid patient who died because he needed an emergency kidney replacement with a dialysis machine but there were no nurses available to run the machine, and having to turn down a transfer of another patient in critical condition because there were no ICU beds left.

This is likely only going to get worse over the holiday season. Many states and cities still refuse to take the mitigation measures necessary to control the virus, even though none of them meet the benchmarks for safely staying open. Vox’s German Lopez painted the grim picture in his most recent update on how each state is faring in containing the coronavirus:

Across these benchmarks, zero states fare well on all three metrics, suggesting no state has its outbreak under control right now. In fact, no state meets even two of three benchmarks — only Washington, DC, does. (Washington state is excluded due to recent problems with its testing reports.) One caveat: Because of Thanksgiving, states are likely underreporting Covid-19 tests and cases. So as bad as things may already seem, they’re likely even worse than reported. America’s outbreaks, reaching from California to Florida, are the result of the public and the country’s leaders never taking the virus seriously enough and, to the extent they did, letting their guard down prematurely. States, with the support of President Donald Trump, moved to reopen — often before they saw sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they didn’t have time to see if each phase of their reopening was leading to too many more cases. The public embraced the reopenings, going out and often not adhering to recommended precautions like physical distancing and wearing a mask. Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. And yet many states moved to reopen once again, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out. It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

There is still time to soften the blow, with states and cities implementing more social distancing restrictions and requiring better mask adherence. But barring a sudden change in public behavior and public policy, America’s outbreak is not going to get better anytime soon.

At this point, we appear to be waiting for the vaccine to be widely distributed to bring the virus under control — something that may not happen for another six months or longer. Prioritizing the most vulnerable populations for vaccination should help reduce the death toll, but there is no avoiding the fact that tens of thousands of Americans are likely to die over the next few months.

CDC Director Robert Redfield said on Wednesday that the US Covid-19 death toll could reach 450,000 by March 1 without better social distancing and mask-wearing. That would mean about 175,000 more deaths between now and then.

In that scenario, the number of Americans who died of Covid-19 would surpass the number of American soldiers who died in all of World War II — and across a much shorter time frame (about one year versus four). In terms of mass-death events in America’s history, the coronavirus pandemic would rank behind only the Civil War and the 1918 flu pandemic.

2020-12-03 18:50:07+00:00,21,"On December 2, a staggering 2,885 Americans were reported to have died of Covid-19, according to the New York Times. It was the highest single-day toll of the year.

It was nearly the same number of people who died in the 9/11 attacks (2,977). And it was far more than the estimated 1,800 Americans who died over a matter of days when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. During World War II, from the Pearl Harbor attacks in December 1941 to Japan’s surrender, about 300 US soldiers died every day on average (and about 407,000 were dead in total by August 1945).

Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has more in common with a slow-motion tragedy, like a war, than an acute event like 9/11. More than 2,600 deaths were reported on December 1, the day before the US set its new record for daily deaths; the previous high had been 2,752 on April 15. With the number of daily new cases and hospitalizations still rising across the country, public health experts expect new terrible death records will be set over the coming winter.

Coronavirus pandemic metrics are slippery things, however. America was so bad at testing during the first few months of the virus’s spread that there were likely quite a few cases and deaths that were caused by Covid-19 but were not counted as such. Even today, the US positive test rate is so high that experts say the statistics aren’t coming close to capturing every case or death.

According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the official number of total deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the US is 274,121. But total excess deaths — the number of deaths above what would be expected in a normal year — has reached 345,000, according to the Times. Most, though not all, of those deaths are likely uncounted Covid-19 fatalities.

At a certain point, this is all academic. What’s undeniable is that America is entering a period of mass death unlike anything we’ve seen so far in the pandemic. Cases and hospitalizations have been rising steadily, and deaths always follow. Improvements in treatment have lowered the fatality rate, but a higher number of hospitalized patients will inevitably mean more deaths. And it is older, low-income, and minority Americans who are dying at disproportionate rates from the coronavirus.

The US also set a new single-day record for current hospitalizations on December 2, topping 100,000 for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Hospitals all across the nation are under tremendous strain.

The US is going to lose a lot more people before the Covid-19 pandemic ends

As hospital beds fill up and staff is stretched thin, the likelihood of losing people who otherwise might have survived under normal circumstances increases.

Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, explained the risks in a recent Twitter thread. He started by pointing out that the percentage of new Covid-19 cases who end up in the hospital is actually shrinking. That would suggest people who would have been hospitalized earlier in the year are now being turned away from the emergency room or asked to stay at home because they’re not yet in critical condition.

Some of this is good public health practice — you want to keep beds open for the sickest patients — but it also creates a situation where somebody who’s at the margins could be denied entry to the hospital and their condition might deteriorate more quickly at home.

Everything — COVID and non-COVID is affected



So borderline admission for heart failure? Person now goes home

This is what is happening in hospitals across America right now — Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) December 1, 2020

Full hospitals could also be left without enough room or staff for patients with other serious conditions, and some of those people could die without access to the medical care they need. They may not die of Covid-19, but they would still be victims of the pandemic.

On Twitter, Kari Jerge, a surgeon in Kansas City, Kansas, described recent dilemmas doctors are facing: a non-Covid patient who died because he needed an emergency kidney replacement with a dialysis machine but there were no nurses available to run the machine, and having to turn down a transfer of another patient in critical condition because there were no ICU beds left.

This is likely only going to get worse over the holiday season. Many states and cities still refuse to take the mitigation measures necessary to control the virus, even though none of them meet the benchmarks for safely staying open. Vox’s German Lopez painted the grim picture in his most recent update on how each state is faring in containing the coronavirus:

Across these benchmarks, zero states fare well on all three metrics, suggesting no state has its outbreak under control right now. In fact, no state meets even two of three benchmarks — only Washington, DC, does. (Washington state is excluded due to recent problems with its testing reports.) One caveat: Because of Thanksgiving, states are likely underreporting Covid-19 tests and cases. So as bad as things may already seem, they’re likely even worse than reported. America’s outbreaks, reaching from California to Florida, are the result of the public and the country’s leaders never taking the virus seriously enough and, to the extent they did, letting their guard down prematurely. States, with the support of President Donald Trump, moved to reopen — often before they saw sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they didn’t have time to see if each phase of their reopening was leading to too many more cases. The public embraced the reopenings, going out and often not adhering to recommended precautions like physical distancing and wearing a mask. Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. And yet many states moved to reopen once again, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out. It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

There is still time to soften the blow, with states and cities implementing more social distancing restrictions and requiring better mask adherence. But barring a sudden change in public behavior and public policy, America’s outbreak is not going to get better anytime soon.

At this point, we appear to be waiting for the vaccine to be widely distributed to bring the virus under control — something that may not happen for another six months or longer. Prioritizing the most vulnerable populations for vaccination should help reduce the death toll, but there is no avoiding the fact that tens of thousands of Americans are likely to die over the next few months.

CDC Director Robert Redfield said on Wednesday that the US Covid-19 death toll could reach 450,000 by March 1 without better social distancing and mask-wearing. That would mean about 175,000 more deaths between now and then.

In that scenario, the number of Americans who died of Covid-19 would surpass the number of American soldiers who died in all of World War II — and across a much shorter time frame (about one year versus four). In terms of mass-death events in America’s history, the coronavirus pandemic would rank behind only the Civil War and the 1918 flu pandemic.

2020-12-03 18:30:18+00:00,10,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested on Wednesday that some people who have been exposed to Covid-19 can quarantine for less than two weeks.

The agency said a 14-day quarantine, in which people stay home and avoid interacting with others, is still the safest option if they come into close contact — within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes — with someone who has Covid-19. Anyone who actually contracts the disease should self-isolate until at least 10 days after symptoms begin, and not leave isolation until their fever is gone for at least 24 hours.

But the CDC updated its guidelines — which are recommendations, not legal requirements — to offer “alternatives.” People who’ve been in close contact with someone with Covid-19 should still quarantine. But that quarantine can end after 10 days without a coronavirus test. Or it can last seven days if someone obtains a negative test result, which they’re advised to get as early as day five of quarantine. People should watch out for symptoms for 14 days after quarantine.

Public health experts described the change as a harm reduction move: It’s not ideal for people to cut their quarantine time short. But if the change lets more people quarantine for some period of time, that could be better overall.

“The new guidelines are an example of a harm reduction approach, or one that takes into account the challenges individuals might face in reducing risks,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “My main concern, however, is about potential confusion, and the need for strong, clear messaging. CDC is still recommending 14-day quarantine — that should not be lost here.”

The CDC hinted at that, citing the possibilities of “economic hardship” and “stress on the public health system” due to 14-day quarantines.

“CDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus,” the agency said.

The incubation period for Covid-19 can be up to two weeks — perhaps even longer in rare cases — suggesting that people can’t say they’re fully in the clear until a 14-day quarantine is up.

But for most people, the incubation period is now believed to be “skewed toward the shorter end of that” 14-day window, Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage said. So most people likely can cut their quarantine time short without posing a risk to others.

The change comes at a particularly calamitous time. Cases in the US are continuing to rise, regularly breaking records. Hospitalizations surpassed 100,000 for the first time this week. The daily death toll is now regularly above 2,000 — levels of death not seen since the initial spring outbreaks.

And things are bound to get worse. Thanks to the virus’s incubation period, and the fact that most people are sick for potentially weeks before hospitalization or death, we still haven’t seen the effects of Thanksgiving gatherings last week. The US could have record-breaking levels of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, right as people go on to gather for Christmas and New Year’s — further spreading the virus in sustained, intimate settings. Meanwhile, a vaccine is likely still months away for most Americans.

The CDC’s new quarantine guidance is an attempt to get Americans to do something, even as many of them resist taking the other steps the agency has called for. If it works, it could help combat just how bad things get in the next few weeks.

The shortened quarantine time is all about harm reduction

In public health, “harm reduction” means acknowledging that people are going to take risks, but still trying to make their behavior as safe as possible. People could eliminate their risk of sexually transmitted infections, for example, by never having sex at all — but given that people are going to have sex, public health officials try to encourage people to do it safely, by using condoms and having fewer partners.

As we’ve gotten more evidence on how the coronavirus spreads, and as the public has become fatigued with the pandemic and more resistant to tougher measures, health officials have increasingly taken a harm reduction approach to fighting Covid-19.

“While we might like to imagine we can instantaneously halt all transmission, in reality we are working to prevent as much as possible, which can sometimes involve trade-offs,” Hanage said.

While it’s better if people from different households don’t socialize — since any interaction carries a risk of transmission — officials have tried to push people toward safer interactions in outdoor environments where the virus can’t spread as easily. The same impulse drives the push to wear masks: Maybe people shouldn’t get their hair cut at all if they want to eliminate the risk of Covid-19, but if they’re going to, they can at least mitigate the risk of transmission with masks.

At a press conference announcing the new recommendations, CDC officials were clear that they would still prefer people quarantine for a full 14 days after exposure. But given the constraints people can face, including the need to work, and the more recent evidence that the incubation period may not be two weeks for most people, the CDC is now trying to offer some flexibility.

“We can safely reduce the length of quarantine, but accepting that there is a small residual risk that a person who is leaving quarantine early could transmit to someone else if they became infected,” John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC’s Covid-19 response, said.

It’s not perfect. With the CDC’s new guidance, some coronavirus infections will likely sneak through that could have been prevented by a 14-day quarantine. But if the guidance stops more infections overall by getting more people to quarantine, even for a less-than-perfect amount of time, that’s still a net benefit in reducing transmission.

This is, in other words, about striking a balance between the ideal steps to stop Covid-19 and people’s willingness to actually follow those steps.

There are still risks with a shortened quarantine

A big risk with the CDC’s guidance is there’s still a lot we don’t know about Covid-19. We’re still learning a lot of the basics about the coronavirus and the disease it causes, from how long incubation lasts to the wide range of symptoms to its long-term effects. It’s still not certain how much transmission is driven by people who never experience symptoms, and that could pose a challenge for the CDC’s guidance if it turns out a lot of people leave their quarantine early — at the new 10-day cutoff, for example — but are able to spread the virus, unknowingly, to others.

On the other hand, there are also studies showing that people may not be infectious for as long as previously thought. So it could turn out that the CDC’s new guidance is too lax, just like it could also be that the agency’s guidelines are still generally too strict.

Some experts were critical about the CDC’s guidance, calling for more clarity or tweaks to the recommendations. Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist, told me she’s concerned that the agency said people can get a test as early as day five of quarantine and use test results to stop quarantining after day seven. “I would’ve liked to see testing on day six or seven and then end of quarantine when the result comes back negative,” Popescu said.

Still, experts were overall receptive to the change, with Popescu noting that “it can help get more compliance for quarantine.” But, she cautioned, the CDC and other officials should be clear about the limitations and a continued need for other steps, like social distancing when possible and masking.

The big risk, for now, is the US is still in the middle of a massive Covid-19 outbreak — one of the worst in the world. In that environment, every single interaction outside of your home is a potential risk for transmission. There’s simply too much virus out there, making it easy for people to spread it.

Despite these circumstances, public health officials have also had to wrestle with the fact that people aren’t listening. For weeks, experts and officials were advising people not to travel for Thanksgiving. Then the country set records for pandemic-era airline travel last week.

The same now seems likely to happen again with Christmas and New Year’s, bringing new superspreading events as the country deals with record highs for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

Given that reality, the CDC is trying to meet people where they are: If individuals are going to do things officials prefer they don’t do, they can at least take some measures — even a reduced quarantine time period — to help slow spread as much as possible. It’s not perfect, but it’s where the country is at.",voxdotcom,"['officials', 'days', 'guidelines', 'risk', 'covid19', 'health', 'period', 'cdc', 'cdcs', 'guidance', 'quarantine', 'changed']",0
2020-12-03 00:50:06+00:00,13,"A bipartisan group of senators and members of the House unveiled a new $908 billion plan for emergency Covid-19 relief funding on Tuesday. Now, 24 hours later, there has been more movement on stimulus negotiations than in the past three months.

In a statement Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the framework — with extended unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and small business loans — should be “used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations” with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (McConnell on Tuesday started circulating a counterproposal of his own among Republicans.)

“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Pelosi and Schumer said. “Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.”

The movement from Democrats is significant; it comes after months of stalemate on stimulus talks, and during a critical time in the Covid-19 crisis as the US sees another surge in cases heading into the winter. About 14 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits will see those programs expire at the end of the month unless Congress takes action, and cities and states around the country are also facing massive budget shortfalls.

The plan was spearheaded by Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), and other senators, and supported by the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus. It’s designed as a short-term extension of federal aid to see the public through the winter; the funding would extend benefits until April 1, when many public health experts expect distribution of a vaccine to be well underway.

“This is going to get us through the most difficult times,” Manchin said at a Tuesday press conference announcing the framework.

McConnell, too, has made moves after meeting with White House officials on Tuesday to suss out what President Donald Trump wants to come out of a coronavirus relief deal. Backed by the White House, McConnell’s version of an emergency package is more limited, providing just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits, rather than the three-month extension in the bipartisan proposal.

Pelosi and Schumer backing a cross-party plan isn’t the only significant change from past attempts at a deal. The plan is supported by a number of Republican senators, including Collins, Lisa Murkowski (AK), Mitt Romney (UT), and Bill Cassidy (LA), so it could weaken McConnell’s leverage in upcoming negotiations.

On Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that he and McConnell agree it would be “optimal” for leadership to wrap up negotiations on a relief package by the weekend, with the end goal being a bill on the floor by next Wednesday or Thursday.

“[McConnell] and I both agree that it would be optimal, if in fact we get to an agreement by the end of this weekend, get that agreement put on paper and memorialized so that we can consider it as early as Wednesday or Thursday of next week,” Hoyer said, adding, “I know that sounds very optimistic.”

With the November election in the rear-view mirror and coronavirus cases spiking across the country, there seems to be new momentum behind getting a deal done. But there’s still a long way to go, and Trump — who has proved the wild card for many a congressional deal — is still very much in the picture.

What’s in the bipartisan proposal

This new proposal is a $908 billion package that repurposes $560 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that passed in March, meaning that this new proposal adds only $348 billion in new spending. It’s much smaller than the $2.2 trillion revised HEROES Act that House Democrats passed in October, but larger than the $500 billion Senate Republicans were proposing in October.

Two large sticking points in negotiations have been whether there should be another round of stimulus checks (a priority for Pelosi and Trump) and liability protections for businesses worried about being sued for exposing customers and workers to Covid-19 (a priority of McConnell’s). Republicans came out on top on both of these issues (at least in this initial proposal) — stimulus checks are not included in this new bipartisan proposal and the framework provided by Sen. Manchin’s office notes that the proposal will “provide short term Federal protection from Coronavirus related lawsuits with the purpose of giving states time to develop their own response.”

Pelosi and Trump have signaled past support for another round of stimulus payments going out to working Americans. But both seem more interested in getting a narrower package approved, in the interest of timing and getting a bill passed quickly.

Here’s what made it into the bipartisan proposal:

$160 billion for state, local, and tribal governments. For context, US cities alone are facing a $360 billion shortfall and are being forced to pursue austerity measures to balance their budgets. As Emily Stewart has reported for Vox, state budget shortfalls could exceed $500 billion. In other words, this money could be a drop in the bucket. State and local government woes have been lower on McConnell’s list of priorities — at one point he suggested that states declare bankruptcy.

State and local government woes have been lower on McConnell’s list of priorities — at one point he suggested that states declare bankruptcy. $180 billion in unemployment insurance (UI). The CARES Act gave unemployed Americans a weekly $600 lifeline on top of state unemployment insurance, a move widely regarded as staving off catastrophe for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs this year. As Dylan Matthews has reported for Vox, research has shown that “the average UI recipient is getting 134 percent of their previous salary,” and it may have temporarily lowered the poverty rate.

This program expired in August, so any relief will be welcome for those still unemployed. Congress originally estimated that the UI program would cost $260 billion which the Tax Policy Center viewed as an underestimate, so it’s likely this extension wouldn’t cover the full cost of unemployed workers’ needs. The Washington Post reported that this amount would cover an additional $300 a week for four months.

$288 billion in support for small businesses. This support will partially come through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. As Forbes has reported, an August 2020 survey from the US census showed that almost 79 percent of small businesses reported being negatively affected by Covid-19.

This support will partially come through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. As Forbes has reported, an August 2020 survey from the US census showed that almost 79 percent of small businesses reported being negatively affected by Covid-19. $25 billion in rental assistance. Notably, the new bipartisan proposal only provides for $25 billion in rental assistance even as economists are predicting that tenants could owe nearly $70 billion in back rent by year’s end. Vox has reported that policy experts and advocates have been pushing for $100 billion to be included in stimulus negotiations in order to prevent an eviction crisis that could impact as many as 40 million Americans.

The framework also includes $45 billion for transportation including airlines and Amtrak, $16 billion for vaccine development and more Covid-19 testing and tracing, $82 billion in federal education funding, $10 billion for the struggling US Postal Service, and $10 billion for child care, among other things.

“This is emergency relief, this is designed to get us through this next quarter,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told reporters. “We know we have more to do, but ... we cannot abandon the American people.”

What’s next for this proposal

With McConnell and the White House backing a skinnier Republican proposal, and Pelosi, Schumer, and the bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the $908 billion proposal, the real negotiations will begin.

McConnell’s version of an emergency package he sent to his Republican members on Tuesday contains no funding for state and local aid, no money for rental assistance, and provides just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits rather than the bipartisan proposal’s three-month extension. McConnell’s bill contains $332.7 billion for PPP loans, $100 billion for education funding, and $47 billion for vaccine distribution and testing and tracing. In the past, the Senate majority leader has capped his bills at $500 billion.

With Democrats coming down from their starting point of $2.2 trillion with the HEROES Act, it’s yet to be seen whether McConnell will also budge from his position. Even though the bipartisan group has more leverage in the Senate, Trump is still president until Biden is sworn in on January 20, and McConnell told reporters he doesn’t want to pass anything that Trump won’t sign.

In the coming weeks, Collins, Manchin, and the others will have to reach out to a lot of senators to see if they can increase the support for their plan. But Democrats are also wary of what Trump — still stinging over his election loss and refusing to concede to Biden — will do with a stimulus package should it reach his desk.

In short, congressional and White House leaders may be talking, but there’s a long way to go in a short amount of time before a final deal can be reached.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'congress', 'negotiations', 'pass', 'state', 'reported', 'ready', '908', 'proposal', 'stimulus', 'mcconnell', 'mitch', 'yes', 'house', 'package', 'bipartisan', 'billion']",0
2020-12-03 00:41:05+00:00,15,"America’s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US’s daily new cases down from an early January peak but still higher than those of most developed nations — and the country recently surpassing 500,000 deaths due to the disease.

At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture.

Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. Combined, these three benchmarks can tell you whether or not a state’s coronavirus outbreak is under control.

Vox’s analysis, updated weekly, shows the vast majority of states are reporting alarming trends for coronavirus cases based on these benchmarks. Only one state — Hawaii — fares well on all three metrics, suggesting the vast majority of states don’t have their outbreaks fully under control right now.

The US outbreaks are due to the failure of both the American public and the country’s leaders to take the virus seriously enough; to the extent they did, many let their guard down prematurely. With the support of former President Donald Trump, states moved to reopen — often before seeing sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they weren’t able to tell whether each phase of their reopening plan was leading to too many new infections.

The public embraced the reopenings, resuming their usual day-to-day activities and often refusing to adhere to recommended precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing.

Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America’s overall caseload remained very high. Yet many states moved to reopen once more, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out.

It’s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control.

“It’s a situation that didn’t have to be,” Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, previously told me, adding, “You had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. … It was not prioritized over the economy.”

The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic.

“Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an expert in infectious diseases and a doctor at the University of Chicago, previously told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”

With a Covid-19 vaccination campaign underway, a finish line to this crisis in finally visible. But until America reaches sufficient population protection — and, preferably, herd immunity — every day the coronavirus spreads means more illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.

As the country works toward vaccinating everyone, the three benchmarks tracked by Vox give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19 in the meantime. Nationwide, it’s pretty grim.

1) Most states have too many daily new Covid-19 infections

What’s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Census Bureau.

Which states meet the goal? Just one — Hawaii.

Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases.

There’s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea — a level low enough that a state can say it’s starting to get significant control over the virus.

A big caveat to this metric: It’s only as good as a state’s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn’t have enough tests, it’s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won’t tell the full story. That’s why it’s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate.

The number of daily new cases may also give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week.

If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases is perhaps the best insight as to how big a state’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

2) The coronavirus is spreading too quickly in some states

What’s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from the Centre for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

Which states meet the goal? All but Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming — 45 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it’s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on.

It’s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state’s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future.

The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn’t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases.

The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it’s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That’s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease’s overall spread.

The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events — which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus.

And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state’s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others.

Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen’s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state’s outbreak now and in the future.

3) Most states’ positive rates for tests are too high

What’s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the previous week, based on data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and the Covid Tracking Project.

Which states meet the goal? Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — 24 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions.

But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don’t have the disease or don’t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there’s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.

The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down — to match nations like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, which have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent or even 1 percent — in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks.

As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it’s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.

So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm — a sign that there’s an outbreak that’s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that’s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

2020-12-02 21:48:26+00:00,10,"A bipartisan group of senators and members of the House unveiled a new $908 billion plan for emergency Covid-19 relief funding on Tuesday. Now, 24 hours later, there has been more movement on stimulus negotiations than in the past three months.

In a statement Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the framework — with extended unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and small business loans — should be “used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations” with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (McConnell on Tuesday started circulating a counterproposal of his own among Republicans.)

“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Pelosi and Schumer said. “Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.”

The movement from Democrats is significant; it comes after months of stalemate on stimulus talks, and during a critical time in the Covid-19 crisis as the US sees another surge in cases heading into the winter. About 14 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits will see those programs expire at the end of the month unless Congress takes action, and cities and states around the country are also facing massive budget shortfalls.

The plan was spearheaded by Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), and other senators, and supported by the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus. It’s designed as a short-term extension of federal aid to see the public through the winter; the funding would extend benefits until April 1, when many public health experts expect distribution of a vaccine to be well underway.

“This is going to get us through the most difficult times,” Manchin said at a Tuesday press conference announcing the framework.

McConnell, too, has made moves after meeting with White House officials on Tuesday to suss out what President Donald Trump wants to come out of a coronavirus relief deal. Backed by the White House, McConnell’s version of an emergency package is more limited, providing just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits, rather than the three-month extension in the bipartisan proposal.

Pelosi and Schumer backing a cross-party plan isn’t the only significant change from past attempts at a deal. The plan is supported by a number of Republican senators, including Collins, Lisa Murkowski (AK), Mitt Romney (UT), and Bill Cassidy (LA), so it could weaken McConnell’s leverage in upcoming negotiations.

On Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that he and McConnell agree it would be “optimal” for leadership to wrap up negotiations on a relief package by the weekend, with the end goal being a bill on the floor by next Wednesday or Thursday.

“[McConnell] and I both agree that it would be optimal, if in fact we get to an agreement by the end of this weekend, get that agreement put on paper and memorialized so that we can consider it as early as Wednesday or Thursday of next week,” Hoyer said, adding, “I know that sounds very optimistic.”

With the November election in the rear-view mirror and coronavirus cases spiking across the country, there seems to be new momentum behind getting a deal done. But there’s still a long way to go, and Trump — who has proved the wild card for many a congressional deal — is still very much in the picture.

What’s in the bipartisan proposal

This new proposal is a $908 billion package that repurposes $560 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that passed in March, meaning that this new proposal adds only $348 billion in new spending. It’s much smaller than the $2.2 trillion revised HEROES Act that House Democrats passed in October, but larger than the $500 billion Senate Republicans were proposing in October.

Two large sticking points in negotiations have been whether there should be another round of stimulus checks (a priority for Pelosi and Trump) and liability protections for businesses worried about being sued for exposing customers and workers to Covid-19 (a priority of McConnell’s). Republicans came out on top on both of these issues (at least in this initial proposal) — stimulus checks are not included in this new bipartisan proposal and the framework provided by Sen. Manchin’s office notes that the proposal will “provide short term Federal protection from Coronavirus related lawsuits with the purpose of giving states time to develop their own response.”

Pelosi and Trump have signaled past support for another round of stimulus payments going out to working Americans. But both seem more interested in getting a narrower package approved, in the interest of timing and getting a bill passed quickly.

Here’s what made it into the bipartisan proposal:

$160 billion for state, local, and tribal governments. For context, US cities alone are facing a $360 billion shortfall and are being forced to pursue austerity measures to balance their budgets. As Emily Stewart has reported for Vox, state budget shortfalls could exceed $500 billion. In other words, this money could be a drop in the bucket. State and local government woes have been lower on McConnell’s list of priorities — at one point he suggested that states declare bankruptcy.

State and local government woes have been lower on McConnell’s list of priorities — at one point he suggested that states declare bankruptcy. $180 billion in unemployment insurance (UI). The CARES Act gave unemployed Americans a weekly $600 lifeline on top of state unemployment insurance, a move widely regarded as staving off catastrophe for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs this year. As Dylan Matthews has reported for Vox, research has shown that “the average UI recipient is getting 134 percent of their previous salary,” and it may have temporarily lowered the poverty rate.

This program expired in August, so any relief will be welcome for those still unemployed. Congress originally estimated that the UI program would cost $260 billion which the Tax Policy Center viewed as an underestimate, so it’s likely this extension wouldn’t cover the full cost of unemployed workers’ needs. The Washington Post reported that this amount would cover an additional $300 a week for four months.

$288 billion in support for small businesses. This support will partially come through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. As Forbes has reported, an August 2020 survey from the US census showed that almost 79 percent of small businesses reported being negatively affected by Covid-19.

This support will partially come through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. As Forbes has reported, an August 2020 survey from the US census showed that almost 79 percent of small businesses reported being negatively affected by Covid-19. $25 billion in rental assistance. Notably, the new bipartisan proposal only provides for $25 billion in rental assistance even as economists are predicting that tenants could owe nearly $70 billion in back rent by year’s end. Vox has reported that policy experts and advocates have been pushing for $100 billion to be included in stimulus negotiations in order to prevent an eviction crisis that could impact as many as 40 million Americans.

The framework also includes $45 billion for transportation including airlines and Amtrak, $16 billion for vaccine development and more Covid-19 testing and tracing, $82 billion in federal education funding, $10 billion for the struggling US Postal Service, and $10 billion for child care, among other things.

“This is emergency relief, this is designed to get us through this next quarter,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told reporters. “We know we have more to do, but ... we cannot abandon the American people.”

What’s next for this proposal

With McConnell and the White House backing a skinnier Republican proposal, and Pelosi, Schumer, and the bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the $908 billion proposal, the real negotiations will begin.

McConnell’s version of an emergency package he sent to his Republican members on Tuesday contains no funding for state and local aid, no money for rental assistance, and provides just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits rather than the bipartisan proposal’s three-month extension. McConnell’s bill contains $332.7 billion for PPP loans, $100 billion for education funding, and $47 billion for vaccine distribution and testing and tracing. In the past, the Senate majority leader has capped his bills at $500 billion.

With Democrats coming down from their starting point of $2.2 trillion with the HEROES Act, it’s yet to be seen whether McConnell will also budge from his position. Even though the bipartisan group has more leverage in the Senate, Trump is still president until Biden is sworn in on January 20, and McConnell told reporters he doesn’t want to pass anything that Trump won’t sign.

In the coming weeks, Collins, Manchin, and the others will have to reach out to a lot of senators to see if they can increase the support for their plan. But Democrats are also wary of what Trump — still stinging over his election loss and refusing to concede to Biden — will do with a stimulus package should it reach his desk.

In short, congressional and White House leaders may be talking, but there’s a long way to go in a short amount of time before a final deal can be reached.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'congress', 'negotiations', 'pass', 'state', 'reported', 'ready', '908', 'proposal', 'stimulus', 'mcconnell', 'mitch', 'yes', 'house', 'package', 'bipartisan', 'billion']",0
2020-12-02 20:45:06+00:00,5,"With two Covid-19 vaccine candidates expected to be approved for the US market in the coming weeks, a group of experts met Tuesday to advise on which Americans should be immunized first. In a 13-1 vote, they put health care personnel and staff and residents of long-term care facilities at the front of the line.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent medical and public health experts, has been meeting for months to think through the question of whom to prioritize during a pandemic while vaccine supplies are still limited.

ACIP is highly influential in the US. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which overwhelmingly accepts the committee’s guidance. States aren’t obliged to follow it, however. It’s up to governors — and individual hospitals and vaccine sites — to make their own vaccine prioritization plans.

But with coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths rising exponentially, the meeting was another stark reminder that vaccine rationing will be a painful reality for months while supplies remain short.

“There is an average of one Covid death per minute right now,” said Dr. Beth Bell of the University of Washington, who chairs ACIP’s Work Groups, at the meeting’s opening. “In the time it takes us to have this ACIP meeting, 180 people will have died of Covid-19.”

And that’s one reason why, vaccine and public health experts told Vox, ACIP should have weighed in sooner. Major health groups like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) have published advice on how countries and other decision-making bodies can set their prioritization plans for Covid-19 vaccines.

“It would have been helpful to have this a week ago,” said Ruth Faden, the founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, since states, which have been waiting on the guidance, must place their first orders of Covid-19 vaccines with the government and share their initial distribution plans by Friday. “States were not caught completely unaware here,” Faden added — since ACIP had signaled in previous meetings the direction they were likely to go — but Tuesday’s guidance could have been more specific, particularly when it comes to how to immunize America’s health workforce.

The advice is not specific enough

ACIP’s primary task on Tuesday was to vote for phase 1a of the rollout for two priority groups: health care personnel and long-term care facility staff and residents, comprising about 24 million people.

According to CDC officials, there will only be 5 million to 10 million doses of the vaccines available per week for these groups once vaccines are approved, which should happen before the end of the year. The two manufacturers that are expected to have vaccines approved first, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, will have enough doses to vaccinate only around 20 million people by the end of December.

Long-term care facility residents and staff are a top priority because they have accounted for 40 percent of US Covid-19 deaths, according to the committee. And it makes sense to prioritize health care workers — they’ve also been among the groups hardest hit by the virus, and we need them healthy and working to keep the health system functioning.

But the gap between the priority groups and the expected supply is a problem ACIP should have addressed, experts say.

It’s not clear from the guidance who among the health workers should go first, said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of public health at Yale School of Public Health. “This matters because states might have 20,000 or 100,000 doses and figuring out where to use them in a priority group is going to be a hard question.”

ACIP has only said that “individuals with direct patient contact,” personnel working in residential care and long-term care facilities, and workers without coronavirus infection in the last 90 days should go first.

“Direct patient care is often interpreted as physicians and nurses and clinicians,” said Saad Omer, director at the Yale Institute for Global Health, who is part of both the WHO and NASEM Covid-19 vaccine prioritization committees. “But you have to go beyond that to explicitly say that includes cleaning workers, others who are doing housekeeping, etc.”

These groups are potentially just as exposed to the coronavirus as ICU doctors or nurses since they’re working in the same high-risk spaces.

“There’s a huge difference between say a dermatologist that’s doing cosmetic surgery in a private office and somebody who’s in a Covid-19 ward in a large inner-city hospital,” Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, added. “It would be enormously helpful if there could be a greater stratification based upon risk of the health worker.”

What’s more, had ACIP been more specific about which health workers are high risk, “you leave open a strategy of prioritizing them then going to other high-risk groups rather than [immunizing] the entirety of the health system workforce,” said Faden — who also advises the WHO on vaccine prioritization.

The next challenge: How to prioritize the elderly

Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said most states are planning to be able to immunize their entire health care workforce within three weeks of getting the first Covid-19 vaccine shipments. If that’s true, “issues here regarding sub-prioritization will be very short-lived and the need for more detailed guidance is reduced,” Schwartz said.

ACIP typically sets recommendations for vaccine policy based on specific vaccines, and they’ll reconvene and potentially shift their advice as soon as Covid-19 vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They’ll also need to vote on which groups come after phase 1a of the rollout.

If ACIP follows through with what they’ve been telegraphing so far, the committee will prioritize essential workers (such as teachers, food and agriculture workers, police, and firefighters) in phase 1b, and adults 65 and older and with high-risk medical conditions in phase 1c.

ACIP would deviate from other international expert groups with this plan, Omer said. The WHO and NASEM vaccine frameworks have both prioritized older adults and adults with underlying health conditions alongside or immediately after health workers, instead of essential workers.

“The reason everyone is prioritizing the elderly — compared to people 18 to 29 years of age — is that even at ages 65 to 74, they have a 90 times higher risk of death,” Omer explained. “My hope is [ACIP] will revisit some of the assumptions that were driving the considerations for the trade-off between essential workers and older age populations.”",voxdotcom,"['acip', 'covid19', 'weighed', 'panel', 'vaccine', 'advisory', 'health', 'workers', 'cdc', 'care', 'groups', 'states', 'guidance', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-02 15:54:10+00:00,17,"The United Kingdom on Wednesday granted temporary authorization for emergency use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to adults age 16 and older, with the first 800,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine slated to be offered in the country next week.

This makes the UK the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine and the first government approval of a vaccine backed by a clinical trial. (Some countries like Russia and China began administering their Covid-19 vaccines before completing large-scale trials.) It’s also the fastest a vaccine has ever gained approval, albeit on a temporary basis.

“I’m confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onward, things are going to be better,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock during a press conference. “And we’re going to have summer next year that everyone can enjoy.”

The UK’s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), granted the temporary authorization shortly after Pfizer and BioNTech reported in November that their Covid-19 vaccine was 95 percent effective. Though this is a temporary authorization, the MHRA is conducting a rolling review of vaccine trial data as it comes in and may grant full approval at a later date. In contrast, the US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating vaccines based on completed studies, which increases the length of the approval process.

The UK government reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech to purchase 40 million doses of the vaccine through 2021 — enough for 20 million people — mainly shipped from Pfizer’s manufacturing plant in Puurs, Belgium.

“This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in a statement.

The UK has been one of the most severely afflicted countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, with 1.6 million reported infections and almost 60,000 deaths in a population of 66 million. The government recently imposed a second national lockdown as cases spiked; restrictions on movement and which businesses can stay open may begin to relax this week as the number of new cases declines. But with winter approaching, the risk of more Covid-19 spread in the UK remains high.

The UK is prioritizing older adults to receive a Covid-19 vaccine

With limited doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to give out for the time being, the UK is establishing several priority tiers for Covid-19 immunization.

The country’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Wednesday laid out guidelines for administering the vaccine based mainly on age. The top priority is residents and workers at care homes for older adults, a ranking based on the number of vaccinations that would be needed in each tier to prevent one death, not necessarily risk of exposure.

That’s why health workers, who will be at the front of the line in the US, are not in the top tier in the UK, even though they may be encountering the virus more frequently. “As the risk of mortality from COVID-19 increases with age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,” according to the guidelines.

The committee divided its overall priority list into nine groups. “It is estimated that taken together, these groups represent around 99% of preventable mortality from COVID-19,” according to the JCVI guidelines.

But the guidelines also note that vaccine deployment strategies may have to shift to address concerns like mitigating health inequalities and logistical challenges. The latter is particularly important for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine because it has some of the most stringent cold storage requirements of any Covid-19 vaccine candidate: temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower. While Pfizer and BioNTech are developing shipping containers that can maintain these temperatures for 30 days, it’s likely that the first facilities to receive it will be major health facilities that already have freezers.

Recipients will have to receive the vaccine as two doses spaced 21 days apart, so rigorous patient tracking will be needed as well.

The US is now waiting on emergency approval for two Covid-19 vaccines

Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week voted on US guidelines for vaccine approval. The recommendations from the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices stated that health workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be up first for a Covid-19 vaccine. That health workers are in the top tier stands in contrast to the guidelines issued by the UK.

Establishing these priorities is all the more critical now that a vaccine is poised to begin distribution in the US in weeks. Pfizer and BioNTech have also applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US from the FDA for their Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA is meeting on December 10 to discuss their vaccine. This week, Moderna, another mRNA Covid-19 vaccine developer, also applied for an EUA.

If granted, these emergency approvals would mark the fastest vaccine development timeline ever, an amazing feat against an unprecedented pandemic. But Covid-19 cases are continuing to rise across the US, and it will still be a few more months before there is widespread access to a vaccine.",voxdotcom,"['older', 'approves', 'authorization', 'covid19', 'health', 'vaccine', 'adults', 'biontech', 'approval', 'workers', 'pfizer', 'temporary', 'care', 'pfizerbiontechs', 'homes', 'uk']",0

“The reason everyone is prioritizing the elderly — compared to people 18 to 29 years of age — is that even at ages 65 to 74, they have a 90 times higher risk of death,” Omer explained. “My hope is [ACIP] will revisit some of the assumptions that were driving the considerations for the trade-off between essential workers and older age populations.”",voxdotcom,"['acip', 'covid19', 'weighed', 'panel', 'vaccine', 'advisory', 'health', 'workers', 'cdc', 'care', 'groups', 'states', 'guidance', 'vaccines']",0
2020-12-01 22:01:33+00:00,19,"A bipartisan group of senators and members of the House unveiled a new $908 billion plan for emergency Covid-19 relief funding on Tuesday. Now, 24 hours later, there has been more movement on stimulus negotiations than in the past three months.

In a statement Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the framework — with extended unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and small business loans — should be “used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations” with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (McConnell on Tuesday started circulating a counterproposal of his own among Republicans.)

“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Pelosi and Schumer said. “Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.”

The movement from Democrats is significant; it comes after months of stalemate on stimulus talks, and during a critical time in the Covid-19 crisis as the US sees another surge in cases heading into the winter. About 14 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits will see those programs expire at the end of the month unless Congress takes action, and cities and states around the country are also facing massive budget shortfalls.

The plan was spearheaded by Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), and other senators, and supported by the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus. It’s designed as a short-term extension of federal aid to see the public through the winter; the funding would extend benefits until April 1, when many public health experts expect distribution of a vaccine to be well underway.

“This is going to get us through the most difficult times,” Manchin said at a Tuesday press conference announcing the framework.

McConnell, too, has made moves after meeting with White House officials on Tuesday to suss out what President Donald Trump wants to come out of a coronavirus relief deal. Backed by the White House, McConnell’s version of an emergency package is more limited, providing just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits, rather than the three-month extension in the bipartisan proposal.

Pelosi and Schumer backing a cross-party plan isn’t the only significant change from past attempts at a deal. The plan is supported by a number of Republican senators, including Collins, Lisa Murkowski (AK), Mitt Romney (UT), and Bill Cassidy (LA), so it could weaken McConnell’s leverage in upcoming negotiations.

On Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that he and McConnell agree it would be “optimal” for leadership to wrap up negotiations on a relief package by the weekend, with the end goal being a bill on the floor by next Wednesday or Thursday.

“[McConnell] and I both agree that it would be optimal, if in fact we get to an agreement by the end of this weekend, get that agreement put on paper and memorialized so that we can consider it as early as Wednesday or Thursday of next week,” Hoyer said, adding, “I know that sounds very optimistic.”

With the November election in the rear-view mirror and coronavirus cases spiking across the country, there seems to be new momentum behind getting a deal done. But there’s still a long way to go, and Trump — who has proved the wild card for many a congressional deal — is still very much in the picture.

What’s in the bipartisan proposal

This new proposal is a $908 billion package that repurposes $560 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that passed in March, meaning that this new proposal adds only $348 billion in new spending. It’s much smaller than the $2.2 trillion revised HEROES Act that House Democrats passed in October, but larger than the $500 billion Senate Republicans were proposing in October.

Two large sticking points in negotiations have been whether there should be another round of stimulus checks (a priority for Pelosi and Trump) and liability protections for businesses worried about being sued for exposing customers and workers to Covid-19 (a priority of McConnell’s). Republicans came out on top on both of these issues (at least in this initial proposal) — stimulus checks are not included in this new bipartisan proposal and the framework provided by Sen. Manchin’s office notes that the proposal will “provide short term Federal protection from Coronavirus related lawsuits with the purpose of giving states time to develop their own response.”

Pelosi and Trump have signaled past support for another round of stimulus payments going out to working Americans. But both seem more interested in getting a narrower package approved, in the interest of timing and getting a bill passed quickly.

Here’s what made it into the bipartisan proposal:

$160 billion for state, local, and tribal governments. For context, US cities alone are facing a $360 billion shortfall and are being forced to pursue austerity measures to balance their budgets. As Emily Stewart has reported for Vox, state budget shortfalls could exceed $500 billion. In other words, this money could be a drop in the bucket. State and local government woes have been lower on McConnell’s list of priorities — at one point he suggested that states declare bankruptcy.

State and local government woes have been lower on McConnell’s list of priorities — at one point he suggested that states declare bankruptcy. $180 billion in unemployment insurance (UI). The CARES Act gave unemployed Americans a weekly $600 lifeline on top of state unemployment insurance, a move widely regarded as staving off catastrophe for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs this year. As Dylan Matthews has reported for Vox, research has shown that “the average UI recipient is getting 134 percent of their previous salary,” and it may have temporarily lowered the poverty rate.

This program expired in August, so any relief will be welcome for those still unemployed. Congress originally estimated that the UI program would cost $260 billion which the Tax Policy Center viewed as an underestimate, so it’s likely this extension wouldn’t cover the full cost of unemployed workers’ needs. The Washington Post reported that this amount would cover an additional $300 a week for four months.

$288 billion in support for small businesses. This support will partially come through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. As Forbes has reported, an August 2020 survey from the US census showed that almost 79 percent of small businesses reported being negatively affected by Covid-19.

As Forbes has reported, an August 2020 survey from the US census showed that almost 79 percent of small businesses reported being negatively affected by Covid-19. $25 billion in rental assistance. Notably, the new bipartisan proposal only provides for $25 billion in rental assistance even as economists are predicting that tenants could owe nearly $70 billion in back rent by year’s end. Vox has reported that policy experts and advocates have been pushing for $100 billion to be included in stimulus negotiations in order to prevent an eviction crisis that could impact as many as 40 million Americans.

The framework also includes $45 billion for transportation including airlines and Amtrak, $16 billion for vaccine development and more Covid-19 testing and tracing, $82 billion in federal education funding, $10 billion for the struggling US Postal Service, and $10 billion for child care, among other things.

“This is emergency relief, this is designed to get us through this next quarter,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told reporters. “We know we have more to do, but ... we cannot abandon the American people.”

What’s next for this proposal

With McConnell and the White House backing a skinnier Republican proposal, and Pelosi, Schumer, and the bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the $908 billion proposal, the real negotiations will begin.

McConnell’s version of an emergency package he sent to his Republican members on Tuesday contains no funding for state and local aid, no money for rental assistance, and provides just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits rather than the bipartisan proposal’s three-month extension. McConnell’s bill contains $332.7 billion for PPP loans, $100 billion for education funding, and $47 billion for vaccine distribution and testing and tracing. In the past, the Senate majority leader has capped his bills at $500 billion.

With Democrats coming down from their starting point of $2.2 trillion with the HEROES Act, it’s yet to be seen whether McConnell will also budge from his position. Even though the bipartisan group has more leverage in the Senate, Trump is still president until Biden is sworn in on January 20, and McConnell told reporters he doesn’t want to pass anything that Trump won’t sign.

In the coming weeks, Collins, Manchin, and the others will have to reach out to a lot of senators to see if they can increase the support for their plan. But Democrats are also wary of what Trump — still stinging over his election loss and refusing to concede to Biden — will do with a stimulus package should it reach his desk.

In short, congressional and White House leaders may be talking, but there’s a long way to go in a short amount of time before a final deal can be reached.",voxdotcom,"['trump', 'congress', 'negotiations', 'pass', 'state', 'reported', 'ready', '908', 'proposal', 'stimulus', 'mcconnell', 'mitch', 'yes', 'house', 'package', 'bipartisan', 'billion']",0

2020-12-01 16:00:09+00:00,9,"When the Covid-19 pandemic forced much of the US to lock down in the spring of 2020, officials and experts worried the necessary social distancing measures would make another public health crisis — the opioid epidemic — worse. Addiction treatment is traditionally done in person, and restrictions on gatherings and closed businesses would make it much less accessible.

So the federal government responded by easing rules for getting into treatment virtually — making it easier for treatment providers to retain patients and attract new ones. Even before the pandemic, experts had been calling for making treatment easier to get in the US, and the new rules were a big step forward.

But with vaccines for the coronavirus moving through clinical trials and the end of the pandemic in sight, advocates are worried that the old rules will snap back into place — making it harder, once again, to get people into addiction treatment.

Officials relaxed federal rules in several ways. They allowed doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, an evidence-based medication for opioid addiction, over video or audio calls without requiring an in-person evaluation. They also made it easier to prescribe the medication across state lines, which previously required prescribers to be licensed in both states. And they eased rules for take-home doses of methadone, another proven opioid addiction medication, which traditionally is administered daily to patients at an in-person clinic.

State and federal officials also made it possible for public health insurance programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, to pay for telemedicine addiction treatment services. And some places received permission to go further — for example, delivering methadone to patients rather than requiring they pick it up in person.

Providers say the changes really helped. Many of them had to go virtual almost overnight, as the threat of the coronavirus became clear to much of the country. But they had feared they wouldn’t be able to prescribe necessary medications at all, given the arduous rules on such drugs, possibly putting their patients at risk of relapse, overdose, and death.

Things haven’t gone perfectly, but the relaxed rules, providers and experts say, have helped avoid the worst of it.

“It was incredibly challenging [for us], as it was for all providers,” Alexis Geier-Horan, vice president of government relations at the addiction treatment provider CleanSlate, told me. “Thankfully, we really didn’t lose many patients. … That was only possible because of what the federal government did in response to public health emergencies.”

Addiction treatment has long been difficult to access in the US. According to federal data, only 1 in 10 people with a drug use disorder get specialty treatment. Multiple problems play into that treatment gap, including a lack of local providers, high costs, and poor insurance coverage. Much of the treatment provided lacks evidence, or even rejects evidence-based modalities, and can even be downright fraudulent — leaving potential patients resistant to getting care in a broken system.

That’s why, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, activists and providers were calling for making it easier to prescribe addiction medications. Pandemic or not, some patients have always struggled with transportation, or lived in underserved areas that would require a lengthy trip to get treatment. For these patients, getting prescriptions by telemedicine or phone, or simply having to go to a clinic less often for medication, would help.

On the flip side, the patients who now rely on these services to get treatment, regardless of the pandemic, could stand to lose if the relaxed regulations expire. That’s what those in the field are now worried about: If those patients lose their means to treatment, they might give up on it altogether.

That would come at a particularly calamitous time for the opioid epidemic. Even before the pandemic, drug overdose deaths were trending up. But with the pandemic and continuing spread of the potent opioid fentanyl, overdose deaths have skyrocketed this year: On April 2020 (the latest month of data), there were nearly 78,000 drug overdose deaths, based on preliminary federal data — a 13 percent increase from the same time last year, setting up 2020 to be the worst year for overdose deaths ever.

That’s not, advocates and experts say, a sign that the measures easing access to addiction treatment failed, but rather that the measures didn’t and couldn’t go far enough to address a rapidly worsening overdose crisis. While the measures likely helped ease some of the pain brought on by Covid-19, they couldn’t resolve all the hurdles to treatment in America. That’s a case for building on the relaxed rules, not taking them away when the pandemic subsides.

“The stakes are life and death,” Kelly Clark, president of the advocacy group Addiction Crisis Solutions, told me. “We know, absolutely, that people who are taking their maintenance medications like buprenorphine for opioid addiction have a decreased chance of dying prematurely because of their addiction compared to those who aren’t on medications. This is very clear.”

Providers now worry the lax rules could go away soon

Two of the three federally approved medications for opioid addiction, methadone and buprenorphine, are among the most regulated drugs in the country. Methadone is only administered at specialized clinics — requiring patients to go to a clinic as often as daily to get it, and only letting them earn the ability to take some doses home over time. Buprenorphine can be prescribed by a doctor and picked up at a pharmacy, like other medications, but it still requires the prescriber to go through a special certification, and starting a patient required an in-person medical evaluation.

Then the Covid-19 pandemic came, almost immediately making these requirements unfeasible for patients and providers who now had to get and do treatment virtually.

So federal agencies took advantage of the federal public health emergency declared to combat Covid-19 to ease the rules — making telemedicine, including video and audio calls, more feasible for buprenorphine, and easing rules for methadone take-home doses. Local and state agencies followed suit.

But the changes are only in effect until the public health emergency expires. That’s left advocates and providers worried, and they’re increasingly sounding the alarm — as early as possible — to get Congress or other officials to act. They’ve called on federal lawmakers to pass the TREATS Act, which would make many of the rule changes permanent, as soon as possible.

“Speaking for [the American Society of Addiction Medicine], ASAM would love to see the TREATS Act passed with any kind of legislation that goes through during this lame-duck [period], so that we don’t have to face this other unknown coming into the year,” Clark, former president of ASAM and vice chair of the group’s Covid-19 task force, told me.

The typical argument for keeping the old rules comes down to fears of diversion: that the medications will be diverted to a black market for recreational uses. Buprenorphine and methadone are opioids, and, though they’re very effective for treating addiction, they can be misused. So loosening access to either too much, the argument goes, could lead to the drugs ending up in the wrong hands.

As the Drug Enforcement Administration put it, “Under normal circumstances, DEA would not consider the initiation of treatment with a controlled substance based on a mere phone call to be consistent with the framework of the [Controlled Substance Act] given that doing so creates a high risk of diversion.”

Providers take these concerns very seriously, and have adopted a range of practices, such as regular urine screenings, to make sure people are actually taking their medications and not relapsing. Many providers are concerned that loosening the rules too much, and simply doing treatment virtually, could make it harder to prevent diversion.

At the same time, some experts argue that concerns about diversion are overblown. For one, some research suggests that diversion is a result of people not being able to legally obtain buprenorphine or other treatment, forcing them to resort to illegal means of getting the medication. So the stricter regulations could be causing more diversion, not preventing it.

That indicates a balancing act is needed. If it turns out, in the pandemic, that expanding telemedicine for buprenorphine increases access without much more, if any, diversion, then maybe the right balance is more toward a laxer regime than the longstanding laws and rules suggest.

“These agencies are trying to balance the public safety side of making these changes with the public health side,” Geier-Horan, who previously worked on addiction treatment under the Obama administration, said. “From a CleanSlate perspective, the benefit of these things far outweighs those [diversion] concerns.”

Some researchers are working to find out if that’s the case, studying how virtual treatment has worked throughout the pandemic. A JAMA Psychiatry article noted there’s a dearth of research on the role of telemedicine in addiction treatment, including whether it improves access and can be done without significantly increasing diversion.

“That could be really helpful in getting people on board,” Allison Lin, lead author of the JAMA Psychiatry article and an addiction psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Michigan and the VA Center for Clinical Management Research, told me. “We do need more research to provide that data. We don’t have those kinds of answers just yet.”

Short of that, providers are sharing their own experiences, arguing that they’ve been able to maintain a level of care, and even gain some patients, throughout the pandemic despite the obvious disruptions Covid-19 has brought on. But they also worry that losing the new tools they have now could lead to the opposite result once the pandemic is over, fueling a drug overdose crisis that’s already getting worse.

Effective addiction treatment is inaccessible to many Americans

Although the Covid-19 pandemic has in some ways overshadowed it, America’s opioid epidemic is still in full force. It’s in fact gotten worse this year, based on the data we have. The widespread sense of isolation and despair that many people have felt this year, coupled with greater difficulty finding help for such problems as many places close down, has contributed to more drug overdose deaths. Paired with that, the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl has continued to supplant heroin in more of the illicit market — and in part because it’s so potent, it’s more likely to cause overdoses and deaths.

“While our attention has gone to Covid, and rightly so, our overdose deaths have skyrocketed,” Clark said. “We have to keep overdose deaths on the map.”

One of the key contributors to this crisis all along has been lack of access to evidence-based treatment. Good treatment remains very difficult to get in the US — it can cost tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket, and despite those high costs, it’s still frequently of bad to mediocre quality. One family I spoke to last year told me that they spent $200,000 on treatment before they found something that worked. That’s an extreme example, but it’s not rare, based on the thousands of responses to Vox’s survey about the issue, for people to spend an exorbitant amount on treatment and end up with little to nothing to show for it.

That’s not because evidence-based treatment doesn’t exist. For opioid addiction, the medications are truly proven to work well. Studies show buprenorphine and methadone reduce all-cause mortality among opioid addiction patients by half or more, and they do a far better job of keeping people in treatment than non-medication approaches. There are all sorts of other good treatment modalities for other kinds of addiction, including medications and paying people to stay in treatment (known as contingency management).

But these evidence-based approaches are dramatically underutilized. According to federal data, only 42 percent of the nearly 15,000 facilities tracked by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provide any type of medication for opioid addiction. This is largely driven by stigma — the faulty notion that medications replace one drug for another, even though the medications are proven to improve outcomes compared to continuing to use illicit drugs.

So there’s a dearth of providers for evidence-based treatment. When those providers are available, they might not be covered by insurance, and cost thousands out of pocket. If someone has gone to a treatment facility before and ended up with a bad experience due to shoddy, evidence-less care, they also might be skeptical that there’s good help out there at all. That all makes treatment less accessible, and people less receptive to it.

That’s why much of the work to combat the opioid epidemic, from legislation passed by Congress to state efforts to more localized approaches to lawsuits, has gone to expanding access to treatment: If truly effective treatment exists, then it’s just a matter of making sure it’s available to the public.

Along those lines, activists had pushed for more access to telemedicine for years. Of particular concern were underserved areas with few providers — like rural West Virginia, which has a massive overdose crisis and not enough addiction treatment providers to handle demand from patients. Telemedicine can make it easier for existing providers to serve other areas in the state, or even people in other states entirely.

It’s also about expanding the spectrum of care. Every person dealing with addiction is different. Some people are fine with being on medications; some people aren’t. Some will like treatment through Zoom or phone; some won’t. Some have a car; some have no reliable transportation. By offering a variety of options for what care is delivered and how, the hope is fewer people won’t get into treatment because there’s not an option for them.

“It’s not to say everybody should get telehealth, or everybody should get in-person [treatment],” Lin said. “It was just that, before, everybody was in person because that was the only option available.”

Covid-19 has made a lot of things worse, including the opioid crisis. A silver lining to all of this is it’s also given us a big, ongoing experiment to see if a telemedicine model can work for addiction care.

Some providers are now hoping that the eventual end of the pandemic isn’t the end of that experiment — given that it may be helping stave off what’s already the worst drug overdose crisis in American history.",voxdotcom,"['challenge', 'overdose', 'federal', 'addiction', 'treatment', 'rules', 'covid19', 'patients', 'medications', 'life', 'pandemic', 'opioid', 'treatments', 'providers', 'death', 'stakes']",0

In January, New York City launched a program to provide Covid-19 treatments to residents at high risk of being hospitalized or killed by the virus — delivered free, to their door.

It was a potentially revolutionary moment in the pandemic’s trajectory, possible only because, at the close of 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization to the first two oral antiviral drugs people can take, at home upon Covid-19 diagnosis, before they get sick enough to be hospitalized.

Paxlovid and molnupiravir, two therapeutic antivirals shown in studies to have varying levels of effectiveness in stunting Covid-19’s dangers for those most at risk, represent a new weapon against a devastating virus that not only spreads with unnerving ease (much more readily than even the 1918 pandemic flu strain) but also has proven so difficult to treat.

Doctors have gotten better at preventing deaths in the severely ill than they were at the beginning of the pandemic, but many people — hundreds every day in the United States alone — are still dying from the disease. There is simply no surefire cure for someone who lands in the hospital.

Although monoclonal antibodies, which help the body fight an infection, have been available for high-risk patients since November 2020, they require IV infusion at a specialized facility, as does the antiviral remdesivir, which demands infusions on three consecutive days, making them much harder for people, especially those who lack reliable transportation or paid time off from work, to access than pills they can take at home.

The new oral antivirals, which arrived with considerably less fanfare than vaccines in late 2020, have the potential to reshape the contours of the pandemic going forward — not just for those at high risk, but also in surprising ways for those who aren’t. Their arrival also marks a potential new era of renewed investment in broadly useful antivirals that could fight not just Covid-19, but also other deadly viruses that have yet to emerge. However, delivering them equitably and in a very short time frame, and the looming threat of resistance, suggest that they face a road pockmarked with challenges.

It wasn’t until the 1960s, 30 years after the first commercially available antibiotics, that the first virus-disarming medications hit the market (the first was a topical drug because it was too toxic to ingest).

Part of the lag was because of the slippery nature of viruses. Unlike bacteria, viruses aren’t, in themselves, alive. Rather, they persist and multiply by taking over a living organism’s cells.

“People think, ‘It’s a germ, why can’t you just eradicate it?’” said Rebecca Wurtz, an infectious disease doctor and population health expert at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.

Disentangling a virus from the cell it has taken over, however, is extremely tricky: The microscopic needle to thread in developing safe, effective antivirals is to hobble the virus but not damage the host cells it is hijacking. To do it, antivirals can take aim at things like the very specific enzymes the virus uses to make copies of itself, which is how molnupiravir works. “When you’re trying to counteract their activity, it’s a very razor-thin edge,” Wurtz said.

Nevertheless, researchers have continued over the years to develop new antivirals. These drugs can help treat, with varying degrees of efficacy, a multitude of infections, including shingles, herpes, hepatitis, even Ebola.

Timothy Sheahan, a virologist with the department of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Public Health, had been working on applying remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat Ebola, to coronavirus infections since 2015 and on molnupiravir, which initially targeted influenza, since 2017.

“We never really thought that the stuff we were doing in the lab would lead to the approval of two antiviral drugs by the FDA,” he said. Till the advent of Covid-19, “nobody cared about coronaviruses, or even knew what they were.”

That early foundational research, however, meant that these drugs could come to market as quickly as they did. “Many other antiviral drug candidates didn’t have that body of information just sitting on the shelves,” Sheahan said.

Despite the years of research, molnupiravir (from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics) and Paxlovid (a combo of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, which Pfizer started developing at the beginning of the pandemic) still needed to go through clinical trials and testing in the Covid-19 landscape. And then companies needed to start making them. When the emergency authorizations came through for their use in late December, although the federal government had placed orders for millions of courses of the drugs, there were just 300,000 courses of molnupiravir and 65,000 of Paxlovid to go around, just as the omicron variant was poised to sicken tens of millions across the country.

In addition to the initially limited supply, these drugs also have inherent shortcomings. In trials, molnupiravir was only about 30 percent more successful than a placebo in keeping infected study participants from being hospitalized or dying. (Subjects were unvaccinated adults with at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19, and experts expect the drugs to perform better among vaccinated people.) It is also not recommended for people who are pregnant or might become pregnant in the near future.

Paxlovid, for its part, appears to be much more powerful. It is about 89 percent effective in preventing hospitalization or death when high-risk participants took it within three days of having symptoms, according to a report published in the BMJ. But Paxlovid comes with a long laundry list of interactions with common drugs, making it unusable for many of the high-risk people it could otherwise help, such as those on some heart or cancer medications.

A potential new era of renewed investment in antivirals that could fight not just Covid-19, but also other deadly viruses that have yet to emerge

As the federal government distributed the limited supply of these medications across the nation earlier this year, many also worried that more vulnerable populations, such as high-risk individuals in under-served communities, would lack equal access to the lifesaving drugs. A fraction of the courses — about 15 percent — was distributed to federally funded health centers that serve these groups. That left the bulk of the first shipments to be distributed through private pharmacies, to be doled out to those who were able to access them first, a sort of non-system that by default favors the well-resourced.

Even for those who have not had to try to avail themselves of these new drugs, they have already had another side effect: pandemic stress reduction. For those who, due to previous illnesses, age, a compromised immune system, or other factors, are less protected by vaccination, these pills offer an added level of security.

“It is reassuring,” said Raymund Razonable, vice chair of infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic. The clinic is still collecting data, but anecdotally, among the high-risk patients he and his colleagues have prescribed these new drugs to so far, they’ve tended to have a good outcome: silence. “They’re not going to call you again,” he said, “because they’re better.”

On a population level, dramatically reducing the number of people who get sick enough to need hospitalization could help preserve the entire health care system during future waves of the virus. This would keep hospitals from being overwhelmed, preserving care for more people, including those who have health needs other than Covid-19.

Whether these drugs will be deployed more widely, directly to people at lower risk, remains to be seen.

If future Covid-19 variants cause relatively “mild” breakthrough infections, like omicron has, antiviral drugs might not become standard for everyone who tests positive. A rougher illness outlook could send more people looking for prescriptions. Yet, because the new antivirals were studied in high-risk, unvaccinated individuals, we don’t know much about how effective they will be at improving symptoms for people who are at low risk for severe disease.

If they can help someone at low risk feel much better, much faster, however, “I would take the drug,” said John Swartzberg, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health.

There’s a chance these sorts of easy-to-take antivirals could play another important role in the pandemic: keeping more people from getting sick in the first place.

Yet it’s still unclear whether the new oral antiviral drugs would make sense as a prophylactic for the more general low-risk population, experts told Vox. And it is unlikely to be prescribed as an ongoing regime, as PrEP is to prevent HIV.

“HIV PrEP is very effective, but you have to remember to take a pill every day, and it has some side effects,” Wurtz said. “So the ideal prophylactic medication would be something that would be long-acting, inexpensive, highly effective, and non-toxic. None of the options that we have available to use meet those criteria yet.”

It’s also possible that these sorts of medications will decrease the odds that a patient will spread the infection to others, making it “so they’re not just another node in transmission,” Wurtz said.

Wurtz finds this a compelling line of questioning as we look at these drugs’ effect on the future of the pandemic. “We hope and expect that if someone is diagnosed with Covid, and we quickly put them on these antivirals, they’ll be less contagious to other people,” she said. She sees that as an important benefit, particularly for nursing homes and other places with lower community immunity to the virus.

Vaccines, experts say, remain the first and best line of defense. “The vaccine is the best tool because it clearly prevents severe illness, hospitalization, and death,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease, emergency medicine, and critical care doctor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Prevention is always better than treatment.”

For those who haven’t mounted as high of an immune response, even after vaccination, or haven’t been able or have chosen not to be vaccinated, the pills could someday be prescribed after a known exposure, even before a positive diagnosis.

The antiviral Tamiflu is already prescribed this way to prevent those at high risk from catching a potentially fatal case of influenza. For example, if an outbreak of flu occurs in an assisted living facility, often everyone is given a course of Tamiflu to prevent additional infections. For Covid-19, monoclonal antibodies have been authorized for this sort of post-exposure prevention in high-risk people since July 2021.

Having courses of oral antivirals on hand for US nursing homes could potentially save thousands of lives during future Covid-19 waves. But the rest of the globe could see an even more dramatic benefit as we look ahead to many more years of living with the virus.

Easy-to-take antivirals could drastically reduce hospitalization and death among the billions of people who remain vulnerable to the disease, including those who have been unable to be vaccinated and those living with conditions that put them at higher risk, such as HIV.

“If we could get the drugs to them, we could prevent an awful lot of hospitalizations and deaths just with the oral medication,” Swartzberg noted. “But it’s a real steep climb to work out all the logistics.” The pills would need, for example, to be substantially cheaper than they are currently in the US: $530 for a course of Paxlovid and $700 for molnupiravir (costs that the US government is currently covering for its residents).

The drugs would still need to surmount many of the same distribution hurdles as other lifesaving medications that frequently fail to become universally accessible.

Whenever we deploy a new weapon against a virus on a broad scale, on the faces of the very scientists and medical workers we would expect to be most jubilant, there might pass a barely perceptible shadow of worry. The specter of resistance always looms.

Similar to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotic treatments, such as in dreaded MRSA infections, viruses can rapidly evolve to shrug off once-deadly attacks by antiviral medications. In some ways, they’re even better at it. “They’re far less sophisticated than bacteria, therefore they need even less to carry on and survive,” Wurtz explained. “They’re literally just packages of patterns; they’re not even really alive. So they can test and cope with mutations, including mutations that make them resistant to antivirals.”

The Covid-19 virus replicates so quickly in a single person — and across so many people — it has almost countless chances to try out new mutations that will make it better at infecting people, evading vaccines, and surviving attempts to quash it with treatments. “So resistance is inevitable,” Wurtz said.

We’ve already seen the genetic gymnastics Covid-19 has performed to frequently get around vaccine-induced immunity (if with greatly reduced severity). The virus has done this by changing aspects of its external spike protein, which is what the vaccines had primed our immune systems to look out for. Fortunately, the new antiviral drugs work on a more intimate and integral part of the virus, its replication machinery, that it is more hard-pressed to alter.

Still, cautioned Mayo Clinic’s Razonable, “We’ve learned from before that there is always going to be some sort of fight between the virus and whatever drugs we have. So there’s always going to be the anticipation of resistance coming.” Some past strains of the flu, for example, have proven resistant to Tamiflu treatment.

One way to try to stave off resistance is to help people take the medication exactly as instructed. (The new antiviral courses require multiple pills to be taken twice a day for five consecutive days.)

The other essential tactic we have for combating resistance is to be ready with new and different pharmaceutical weapons. “If we know resistance is going to come, we should get ourselves ready and develop some other drugs, with different mechanisms of action, so that when the time comes, we’ll be ready,” Razonable said.

The lineup of potential new drugs to help prevent more Covid-19 deaths, experts say, is fair. But it could be better. Before 2020, much of the recent research had been in highly targeted antivirals that were less likely to work on a new virus.

The pandemic renewed interest in broad-spectrum antivirals of the sort Sheahan has worked on, which could be effective against a wide swath of viruses, including new mutations of the coronavirus and as-yet-unknown viruses. (They worked on assessing remdesivir and molnupiravir for such a broad band of coronaviruses by testing them not just against ones that had infected humans, such as SARS and MERS, but also on those circulating in a range of animals, such as mice, bats, and pigs, which could sow future pandemics.) As Sheahan noted, “it’s a process that takes time.”

For now, for the two oral antivirals to wield the greatest force in reshaping the hospitalization and death curves of the pandemic, people who can benefit from them most must get them — and quickly. That hasn’t been easy so far.

Both molnupiravir and Paxlovid need to be taken within five days of first symptoms. Why? “When you think about disease caused by Covid-19 and the severity, it’s an interaction of two things: the virus and your immune system,” Adalja explained. “Right after about five days or so, the virus is probably less of a player, and it’s your immune reaction to the virus,” he said. “If you let the virus rip for five days in someone, they may already be at the cusp of being hospitalized anyways. So the faster, the better.”

It’s easy to see how that process wouldn’t always go so smoothly. Testing is one weak link in the chain.

Swartzberg described a scenario where someone develops symptoms but first needs to acquire a rapid test. Once they do, if their first test is negative, they might wait a couple of days and test again. If their test is negative again but they still think they might be infected, they might seek out an appointment for a PCR test — and then have to wait 48 hours for results. “You can see where it’s beyond five days right there,” he said. And the person in this scenario hadn’t even gotten as far as contacting their doctor or nurse, let alone having their prescription in hand to start trying to track down the pills.

Adalja noted that the prescribing process itself will need to be quick and low-friction. “Doctors have to be comfortable saying a home test is a threshold to prescribe,” he said, and not insisting on confirmation from an official PCR test.

New York City’s home-delivery program addressed another logistical issue, which is simply getting the medication to Covid-infected people, whom no one wants turning up in the local pharmacy line in person.

“There is always going to be some sort of fight between the virus and whatever drugs we have. There’s always going to be the anticipation of resistance coming.”

And there’s been a telling surprise: In early February, there was actually an oversupply of these potentially lifesaving medications at some US pharmacies. This suggests that the many hurdles in obtaining these drugs, as well as their not-insignificant limitations, mean we’re not yet ready to extinguish the pandemic’s deadly blaze with billions of blister packs and some water.

Once these challenges are addressed, though, could these types of drugs meaningfully change the future of the pandemic for all of us?

“Cases are going to ebb and flow every year,” Adalja said. “As this transitions to endemic, there will likely be a role for this drug in keeping people out of the hospital.”

Yet, as much as these sorts of oral antivirals might mercifully lop off the spikes of hospitalization and death we have seen in the pandemic so far, they will not end it. “Oral antivirals will always have a role in people who are elderly and immunocompromised, but not as a pandemic-stopper,” Wurtz said. “Vaccination is the pandemic-stopper.”

2022-03-25 11:01:07+00:00,12,"This month, Hong Kong saw its Covid-19 death rate become the highest in the world, topping 37 deaths per million people. The recent outbreak was a brutal shock to the 7.4 million residents of the bustling metropolis, which had until recently kept Covid-19 cases to admirably low levels. Hong Kong was once applauded for its response to Covid-19. Then it became the global epicenter of the pandemic.

Other cities in China like Shenzhen and Shanghai have also seen huge surges in infections, and countries in the Eastern Pacific like South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia have seen a surge in cases this month as well. That’s largely due to the rise of BA.2, a highly infectious, hard to identify subvariant of omicron, itself a more transmissible version of the virus that causes Covid-19. Some of these countries also started to relax restrictions on travel and public gatherings just as the new subvariant took root.

But a towering spike in cases doesn’t necessarily mean that hospitalizations and deaths will see a similar jump. In South Korea, even while reaching a new daily record of 470 Covid-19 deaths in March, the death rate so far has been 6 per million residents.

So Hong Kong stands out because its latest Covid-19 wave was especially deadly. Fortunately, cases and deaths are on the decline. But it’s worth asking: Why did the latest Covid-19 wave hit Hong Kong so hard?

To find out, I spoke with Dr. Kelvin To, a clinical associate professor of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong. He’s both a researcher studying Covid-19 and a physician at Queen Mary Hospital who treats patients. To explained that residents took some of Hong Kong’s earlier successes for granted, making them complacent in critical public health measures, like vaccinating people at high risk of severe disease.

The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Umair Irfan

What are the factors right now that seem to be the most significant for Hong Kong’s Covid-19 outbreak? Why are we seeing it now? What variables should we be paying attention to?

Kelvin To

I think the most important is the vaccination problem in Hong Kong, the extremely low vaccination rates among the elderly, especially those older than 80 years old. The vaccination rate for them was only about 20 percent by the end of 2021. That’s the most vulnerable population, and they’re not protected at all. The data from our pandemic on this wave is very clear: Those elderly who were not vaccinated actually had a much, much higher, death rate than those with the vaccination.

Another reason is the incidence of infection in Hong Kong was so low in the past. By the end of 2021, we had about 12,000 cases out of 7.3 million people in Hong Kong, which is less than 0.2 percent. So basically in Hong Kong, very, very few people have natural immunity against the virus.

Third, in the past waves, you got about a hundred or so cases in a day, and that’s already a lot. But in those days with only a hundred cases, you can actually put everybody in the hospital, in isolation, in quarantine camps. But when they are not hundreds but thousands of cases per day, then people can only be quarantined at home.

And, you know, Hong Kong is very crowded. Basically most people live in apartments and many of them live in very, very small apartments. Unfortunately, there are many poor people who actually share a flat with many other people. So this space is kind of impossible for you to do any preventive measures in those settings.

And of course, the virus this time is very different. In the past, we in Hong Kong see the virus, we see infections, and then we isolate people. Usually, the spread is very limited once you do that. But this time, especially at the beginning of the omicron wave, when we still had very, very few cases, we did a lot of investigations into each of the clusters.

You can see that in a restaurant, an infected patient sitting in one corner of the restaurant and another customer sitting at the other end of the restaurant got infected. It’s not just spreading to people around you, but can actually spread over long distances. For example, there are cases in apartment buildings. And what people have found is that spread is not because of direct contact between neighbors but because infected air that got removed from a flat from an exhaust fan can go up through the air to the other apartments.

Umair Irfan

Given all those factors, was this preventable?

Kelvin To

If Hong Kong was much, much better vaccinated, then I believe this wave could’ve been prevented.

In Hong Kong, the vaccination campaign was very aggressive. Almost every day, you heard on the news that you should get vaccinated. And the government is doing as much as they can to get people vaccines. They tried to have vaccine passes before you can go to certain restaurants, and things like that.

But the problem is some people just don’t want to get vaccinated, or worse, they don’t want their elderly parents to get vaccinated. The reason is because they thought — and many are still thinking — that the Covid-19 vaccine is very dangerous.

Another reason that people in Hong Kong don’t want to get vaccinated is they believe they won’t get the infection because the incidence of Covid-19 was so low in the past. So they thought, okay, if I stay indoors, I don’t go out, I always wear protection, then I won’t get infected.

This is something that happens when you’re doing too well, in some ways, so people think it’s not important to get vaccinated.

Umair Irfan

Hong Kong is not the only place seeing an outbreak in China. There are outbreaks in Shenzhen and Shanghai. I’m wondering how distinct is Hong Kong’s outbreak, or what does it have in common with these other major cities?

Kelvin To

The major difference in Shenzhen or Shanghai is that they still have sufficient facilities to isolate or quarantine people. They also locked down the cities very early. They had PCR tests for the whole population, we’re talking about millions of people. Basically they could do a massive screening for the whole city in a short period of time. They isolated everyone who was infected very quickly. That’s why they were able to really stop it within a week. Of course, Shenzhen is much bigger than Hong Kong and not as crowded.

Umair Irfan

What does this mean for China’s zero-Covid strategy?

Kelvin To

It’s not really an absolute zero policy. The Chinese government calls it dynamic zero. What they mean is you try to catch it early and then try to stop it from spreading. It sort of worked well in that the Chinese economy and people are living quite normally. But of course, you cannot shut down from the rest of the world forever. It’s a question of timing of when to start to relax.

If you suddenly open up now, then a lot of cities in China can just become like Hong Kong and suddenly the health care system can collapse in a matter of weeks. So a full opening-up is very dangerous right now. When to open up depends on a lot of things. And I think the most important is the vaccination rate and the availability of effective Covid-19 drugs.

Umair Irfan

What do you make of how the leadership in Hong Kong is handling this? How could they improve?

Kelvin To

I think there are obviously things that can be improved. For example, I think the government should review what has happened in this wave. Was there any moment that more aggressive measures could’ve been taken in the beginning, especially in the middle of February?

Secondly, there should be better coordination in terms of quarantining or isolating people. You can never have enough place to isolate everyone in Hong Kong. It’s impossible. But at least the government should have plans for how to convert existing places into isolation facilities more quickly.

Umair Irfan

For those of us watching from the outside, what lessons do you think we should take away?

Kelvin To

In Hong Kong, people didn’t believe it would occur. People did not believe the health care system would collapse. The government had some plans, but they probably didn’t anticipate that it would collapse the way that it did in Hong Kong.

For the rest of the world, no matter how good it is right now in terms of the pandemic, I can only say that Covid can just catch you by surprise. Omicron this time is fortunate in a way that it is milder than previous variants. But you never know, you may have a variant that is as transmissible or more transmissible than omicron, or even more severe than the previous strains.

I think people around the world should not expect that you can just think it’s gone. I’m not saying that people should be scared, but at least there should be some kind of preparedness plan. The window of opportunity to stop an outbreak is very, very narrow. Once the health care system collapses, everything is just like a domino effect.

Umair Irfan

How are you, your family, and your colleagues holding up through all this?

Kelvin To

We are okay. Of course, we lost our social life. I haven’t eaten out for a long, long time and I haven’t seen a lot of friends. One good thing about being a doctor is that I still have to go to work every day, just like normal life, but even more busy. For me, there’s still some social interactions at work, which I prefer. I myself do not like work from home because I prefer real face-to-face social interaction.

I would say I’m very lucky. I’m a doctor and I didn’t lose my job. Many people in Hong Kong have, because of all the restrictions, basically lost their income. This wave has taken a toll on them, definitely.",voxdotcom,"['nightmare', 'vaccinated', 'rate', 'outbreak', 'covid19', 'think', 'wave', 'success', 'turned', 'vaccination', 'kongs', 'kong', 'hong', 'cases', 'pandemic']",0

2022-03-22 15:02:07+00:00,5,"As I write this, the White House is warning that it will soon run out of funding to address the Covid-19 pandemic.

Without additional money, uninsured Americans will stop being able to get free tests and treatments for Covid-19 after March 22, and won’t be able to get free vaccinations through the federal Uninsured Program after April 5. The White House says it won’t be able to buy additional antiviral pills or new monoclonal antibody treatments for people with Covid, or to fund surveillance that could catch future waves of the virus.

The administration wants $22 billion; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has tried to pass $15 billion only to face a rebellion from both Republicans and Democrats angry that the money would come out of the Biden stimulus plan’s funds for state governments. If this stalemate holds, the federal effort to halt the virus could effectively be over, even though the pandemic itself clearly isn’t.

That would be a disaster. Equally disastrous, though, is that Congress is simultaneously refusing to invest heavily in preventing the next pandemic.

The failures that made Covid-19 such a catastrophe — and kept the federal government and international community from squelching it when it was still a minor outbreak — still exist. We still lack the ability to adequately monitor new infectious diseases, and we still don’t invest sufficiently in preparing treatments and vaccines for viruses that could cause a pandemic if unchecked.

To be fair, Congress hasn’t done zero. There’s bipartisan support for a bill including some legal changes that could improve pandemic preparedness. Called the PREVENT Pandemics Act, it’s the culmination of a year-long effort by Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) committee chair Patty Murray (D-WA) and ranking member Richard Burr (R-NC), and it passed the committee by an overwhelming 20-2 margin on March 15.

The bill authorizes a 9/11 Commission-style investigation into the government’s failure to contain Covid-19, establishes a White House office for pandemic preparedness, and demands more information sharing between the CDC, state and local health departments, and other public health agencies, among many other provisions. If the bipartisan committee vote is any indication, the measure has strong odds of passing the Senate and House and making it to Joe Biden’s desk.

But the act only includes about $2 billion in new spending to prevent future pandemics. For comparison, a bipartisan group of former government officials (including noted conservatives like former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge) has called for a $10 billion annual investment in biodefense over the next decade, adding up to $100 billion over the next 10 years. Biden’s own pandemic preparedness plan calls for $65.3 billion in funding over the next seven to 10 years; over $24 billion would go to developing and manufacturing vaccines alone.

The PREVENT Pandemics Act, in other words, leaves out about 97 percent of the funding that bipartisan experts, and the White House, think is necessary to prevent pandemics.

“Time after time, throughout the past two years we have seen how our response to this pandemic could have, and should have, been better — how public health data was slow and incomplete, how development and review of tests and treatments could have been faster, and so much more,” Murray told Vox in a statement. “The PREVENT Pandemics Act is a set of bipartisan solutions that will help address these policy breakdowns and help us better respond to future public health threats.

“But getting the PREVENT Pandemics Act across the finish line is just one part of the equation: we also need to pass the COVID-19 emergency supplemental funding so that our response right now doesn’t falter, and we absolutely need sustained, annual funding for public health so that preparedness remains a priority into the future, as I’ve proposed in my Public Health Infrastructure Saves Lives Act.”

I hope Sen. Murray is successful — but I worry that this bill might have been an optimal place to put that funding.

The current American policy toward pandemics is, frankly, nuts. The federal government is slashing funding for combating a pandemic still killing hundreds of people a day, and not investing much of anything toward preventing another pathogen from unleashing similar or worse damage. Prevention funding would easily pay for itself if it even slightly lowers the odds of a future pandemic. So why isn’t Congress ponying up?

What Congress is spending versus what it needs to spend

The PREVENT Act is, at least, a start. But it’s much more a set of rules changes than a funding bill. The difference becomes clear when you compare it to the White House’s much more comprehensive pandemic prevention proposal.

Nikki Teran, the senior biosecurity fellow at the Institute for Progress and a PhD geneticist, has been tracking the PREVENT Pandemics bill closely and helpfully put together a chart comparing spending levels in the bill to those in Biden’s pandemic prevention plan.

The chart tallies the amounts on each area of pandemic prevention that the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan, the White House proposal to boost preparedness, and how they compare to the funding amounts authorized in the PREVENT Pandemics Act.

The White House proposal includes, among other things, $24.2 billion in spending on vaccine preparedness (for instance, improving manufacturing capacity and developing candidate vaccines for common types of viruses), $11.8 billion to prepare antiviral and other therapies against likely pandemic pathogens, and $5 billion on research and manufacturing for testing, as well as funding for personal protective equipment (PPE) and improving building design (for instance through better ventilation). It’s worth reviewing the spending plan in full just to get a sense of how sprawling and comprehensive it is.

Public health experts, like those authoring the White House plan, have a decent idea of where the money ought to go. What they don’t have is the actual money from Congress.

They won’t necessarily get the money, even if PREVENT passes. Note that the PREVENT Act does not actually appropriate any money. The HELP committee where the act originated does not have the ability to allocate spending; in this case that’s the province of the appropriations committee. Authorizing funding merely creates a pathway for the funding to be appropriated in the next congressional spending bill.

Even if the act passed, in other words, it would need additional action from Congress to get the measly $2 billion it authorizes spent. With a 50-50 Senate and Republicans likely to retake Congress this fall, the odds of even that happening aren’t too high.

What it does authorize isn’t bad. It includes, for instance, $175 million for the CDC to distribute for genomic sequencing. That’s encouraging, because even a small system of linked sequencing machines at major hospitals, combined with routine sequencing of blood samples from ER patients, would enable the CDC to catch viruses with novel DNA before they’ve spread widely. The US has been a laggard when it comes to this technology; Australia, the UK, and South Africa have been much more aggressive at using genomic surveillance to detect new Covid-19 variants.

That’s not nearly enough for the kind of system we need, however. “The cost to set up and run a surveillance architecture in 200 urban hospitals in the US would be well under $1 billion, and it could be done within a year,” scientist David Ecker wrote in Scientific American last year.

More troublingly, the money comes with some odd strings. Teran notes that the funding is required to go to government agencies, like local health offices, or academic institutions/national labs. It can’t go to, say, nonprofit hospitals, except perhaps through affiliated medical schools. That might make deployment to the high-volume ERs where this sequencing is needed more challenging: most large hospitals are nonprofits, and they can’t directly acquire genomic sequencers through this funding, creating possible gaps in how many Americans the ER surveillance system covers.

“I do think it will likely go to the right spots,” Teran said about the funding, but added that this restriction is “a bit limiting.”

The next largest bucket of money, $161.8 million, goes to the CDC directly to improve its data sharing. The agency was long considered the world leader in infectious disease control, but it hasn’t exactly covered itself in glory during this pandemic. In his book on the Covid-19 emergency, former FDA Director Scott Gottlieb reports that the agency delayed test availability because its scientists patented the rights to the first tests and sharply limited commercial manufacturers’ access to samples of the virus, which they needed to make their own tests.

“Anyone who wanted to make a lab test for COVID had to follow the CDC’s test design, Gottlieb notes, “but to use that blueprint, they had to first secure a license to the agency’s intellectual property.”

Making matters worse, the first test that became available from the CDC turned out to be wholly ineffective, because of an appalling, preventable lab screw-up by CDC scientists.

Some might wonder — I, in fact, wonder — whether it’s prudent to give an agency that’s behaved so poorly additional funding without very substantial reforms. Increased funding can, for sure, help dysfunctional agencies whose main problem is a shortage of funding, and many experts have identified a lack of funding (especially for data sharing) as one of the CDC’s big problems.

But there are other problems too. Gottlieb reports in his book that Deborah Birx, who coordinated Covid-19 response under President Trump, secured funding to send to the CDC “to modernize its reporting of the COVID hospital data.” The modernization was incredibly mild; the Atlantic’s Alexis Madrigal reports that it amounted to a single spreadsheet column, showing how many doses of the antiviral remdesivir hospitals had.

The CDC insisted that adding this single spreadsheet column would take three weeks — in July 2020, as severe cases were piling up and accurately targeting remdesivir to the hospitals that needed it most was essential. Birx wound up having to set up a parallel system collating hospital data because of the CDC’s inability to get the job done.

If the CDC wasn’t able to rapidly improve data-sharing when given money at the height of the pandemic, why would they be inclined to do so now?

The PREVENT Act does offer some reforms apart from the new CDC funding. It makes the CDC director Senate-confirmable, requires annual testimony by them, and directs the agency to improve data sharing (which is what the bulk of the funding is for). But it doesn’t remove the CDC’s ability to patent diagnostic tests and strictly ration access to viral samples. Simply directing the agency to get better at data sharing and offering money for the project might not be enough.

We need real pandemic prevention investment

My point here is not to beat up on the PREVENT Act. Given an all-or-nothing choice between passing it and not passing it, we should pass it. A real investigation into the government’s response to Covid-19 would reveal more important failures like those limned above, and could spur congressional action toward more reforms and investment in preventing the next pandemic. Having a standing office for pandemic prevention in the White House will help keep the issue on decision-makers’ minds.

But it’s crucial that the federal government not stop there. It would be valuable for the Senate’s counterparts in the House to add additional funding authorizations for whole categories of interventions not included in the Senate bill, if feasible on a bipartisan basis: more funding for better tests, vaccine and treatment candidates against potential pandemic pathogens, new manufacturing facilities so we can surge production of countermeasures in an emergency, etc.

And if this bill does not wind up being the occasion for that sort of investment, Congress should be sure to find another occasion. $2 billion in spending authorizations simply is not enough to prevent pandemics going forward. We know what to do, and what it costs. We simply have to do it.",voxdotcom,"['funding', 'prevent', 'money', 'failure', 'white', 'epic', 'act', 'cdc', 'pandemics', 'house', 'congresss', 'pandemic', 'billion']",0

2022-03-16 20:35:07+00:00,22,"Two years into the pandemic, researchers are still trying to understand what makes some people more likely than others to die from Covid-19. Although we know some of the risk factors — like age and underlying disease — others are less obvious. Identifying them could ease our current pain, protect communities from future epidemics, and point us toward some of the societal fractures we should most urgently try to mend.

One of the more surprising answers to this question is one that appears to have a relatively straightforward solution: internet access.

This March, researchers at the University of Chicago published a study in the journal JAMA Network Open that showed one of the factors most consistently associated with a high risk of death due to Covid-19 in the US was the lack of internet access, whether broadband, dial-up, or cellular. This was regardless of other demographic risk factors like socioeconomic status, education, age, disability, rent burden, health insurance coverage, or immigration status.

The study authors estimated that for every additional 1 percent of residents in a county who have internet access, between 2.4 and six deaths per 100,000 people could be prevented, depending on the makeup of the region.

The findings held more surprises. The trend held true not just in rural areas with sparse internet access, but also in urban areas, where most homes can be wired for broadband internet. That is, people who could get internet access in cities but either don’t or can’t are also at increased risk of dying from Covid-19.

“We believe this finding suggests that more awareness is needed,” the study authors wrote in the paper. “Populations with limited internet access remain understudied and are often excluded in pandemic research.”

Still, questions remain. Why does internet access seem to be protective? And would increasing it yield meaningful improvements in public health?

The answers to those questions matter because while the American marketplace has generally treated internet access as a luxury, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed that the ability to get online might be a matter of life or death.

America’s internet inequality, explained

Internet access has been inequitable for almost as long as there’s been an internet.

In 2000, when the Pew Research Center first began gathering data on Americans’ internet use, its researchers found large gaps: older Americans, low-income people, minorities, people with less education, and those who live in rural areas were less likely to be online.

While some of those gaps have since narrowed, most of them stubbornly remain. More than a quarter of Americans still don’t have home broadband internet, and the proportion without access is twice as high for those without any college education and those who earn less than $30,000 a year. Only 63 percent of rural homes have broadband access, as do about half of those living on tribal lands — even if they have a computer.

These inequities were not created by chance. In the US, private internet service providers developed the infrastructure for broadband internet access where it was profitable. As a consequence, many of the country’s most marginalized communities have the fewest, most expensive, and lowest-quality choices when it comes to an internet service provider.

As those access gaps persisted over the years, more and more health services came online. That left those without access unable to use telemedicine, or even easily look up information about health conditions. Over the last few years, researchers have started to see internet access, and in particular high-speed broadband, as a critical component of health — something vital for connecting people not only with health care, but also with food, housing, education, and income, all of which are considered social determinants of health.

Then, as Covid-19 pushed routine health care provider visits into the telehealth space, people without internet access — many of them already medically underserved — found health care even harder to access. Home broadband drew a sharper line than ever before between haves and have-nots; access to internet bandwidth suddenly determined access to educational instruction, economic stability, food pantry sign-ups, vaccine availability and safety information, human contact, and so many other resources.

Before the pandemic, broadband internet access was only occasionally described as a social determinant of health, but over the past two years, its centrality has crystallized. “Broadband internet access acts as a gateway to information and services,” said Natalie Benda, a health care informatics researcher who co-authored an editorial on the subject in the American Journal of Public Health.

Having broadband internet access means having access to education and financial stability, which on their own contribute to our well-being. The connections are so strong, Benda said, that the Federal Communications Commission is now framing broadband internet access as a “super” determinant of health.

There’s a huge amount of observational data showing broadband internet access tracks with other factors that predict health, like income, race, and education. However, there is almost no experimental data linking internet access with health outcomes themselves.

The pandemic provided an opportunity to accelerate our understanding of just how internet access is related to health because it exacerbated many of the existing inequalities underlying health disparities.

Linking internet access to Covid-19 mortality

Prior to the pandemic, the investigators might not have thought to include internet access as a variable, said Qinyun Lin, one of the study’s co-authors. However, another study had linked home broadband internet to Chicago-area Covid-19 mortality; that finding, combined with the team’s own pandemic experiences of retreating to life online, led them to consider internet access as essential in the Covid-19 context. The authors drew on census data on households without access to any form of internet, whether broadband, dial-up, satellite, or cellular. (Note: The study does not directly compare the impact of having broadband versus dial-up or any other category.)

In Lin’s study, internet access was the only factor associated with higher mortality rates in rural, urban, and suburban areas (the study also included measures of socioeconomic status, education, age, and other demographic risk factors). The effect was strong: In rural areas, a 1 percent decrease in a county’s internet access was associated with 2.4 deaths per 100,000 people. But the effect was even stronger in urban areas, where the same difference in access was associated with nearly six deaths per 100,000 people.

The investigators weren’t surprised to find that low internet access was associated with high death rates, said study coordinator and co-author Susan Paykin. But they were surprised by how strong the association was, and surprised by its presence in both rural and urban areas.

None of the other demographic variables the team examined — including socioeconomic status — were significant across all three types of communities, said Paykin. There’s a lot of attention and research put into broadband gaps in rural areas, “but I think that misses a lot of what’s clearly going on in suburban and urban communities,” she said. That means lack of internet access isn’t just a rural infrastructure problem. It’s likely a problem of affordability in cities as well.

Questions remain about the why of it all

Internet access doesn’t boost your immune system or filter your air — so what’s the mechanism explaining the robust relationship between low digital connectivity and high Covid-19 death rates?

The absence of internet access in a household can signify a variety of other factors that are known to increase the risk of dying from Covid-19: old age, housing problems, or difficulty accessing quality health care. But Lin’s study accounted for these characteristics in the analysis, suggesting the lack of internet access was the real source of risk.

Lin hypothesizes that it’s all about lacking information. “If they have limited access to the internet, they rely more on their personal network or their local network to get Covid-19-related information,” she said. That may lead to being influenced by low-quality information sowing distrust in vaccines, for example. But her study wasn’t designed to show why Covid-19 deaths were more common in counties where internet access was more scarce, she says, and more research is needed to answer this question.

New funding for broadband expansion will solve some access problems but not the root cause of them

The good news here is that internet access is a problem the US government has actually allocated money to solve.

In November, Congress passed an infrastructure bill that included $65 billion in funding for broadband internet expansion. Two-thirds of the funding will support the creation of infrastructure, largely in rural parts of each state, and an additional large chunk will pay for $30 monthly subsidies to help low-income households pay for internet access.

Smaller amounts have been earmarked for programs to teach new users the tech skills they need to use the internet, programs to expand access in tribal communities, and other initiatives.

That means a lot of the new money “gets funneled toward rural areas without access to what we consider basic broadband today,” said Ry Marcattilio-McCracken, a senior researcher with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s Community Broadband Networks Initiative.

In many ways, that’s a good thing: Because rural communities have not been profitable areas of development for the telecommunications monopolies that serve them, infrastructure to support rural access to even the lowest-speed broadband internet has been woefully underdeveloped.

But the bill doesn’t do as much to address disparities in areas that have good infrastructure but low affordability, said Marcattilio-McCracken. Residents of many cities cannot afford an $80 monthly bill for broadband internet, even with the $30 subsidies the new funding would provide. And because the bill disincentivizes competition, urban residents will not have new internet service providers to choose from any time soon.

One of the most promising solutions to urban internet insecurity — and one the Biden administration initially wrote into the bill — is the creation of cooperative community networks. These municipally run internet service providers are able to provide higher download speeds, lower prices, and better service to city residents — plus, they are relatively uncomplicated to set up, and as easy to sign up for as, say, city-run electrical utilities, Marcattilio-McCracken said.

They do require startup funding, he said, but ultimately, these providers prioritize access over profit. “They’ve got a whole different set of motives in building an operating infrastructure, and it means building more resilient communities,” Marcattilio-McCracken said.

“Broadband internet access should be a public utility,” Benda said, especially considering the research linking access to health. It’s a need, not a privilege; that means making it as accessible and adjustable as water or electricity use, she said.

Will expanding access improve health? It’s an experiment worth conducting.

Researchers know the lack of internet access is associated with poor health outcomes, but one thing still remains to be seen: Does expanding access work as an intervention to improve health?

In the coming years, the expansion of broadband will at least provide a natural experiment to test this question. Regardless, the pandemic has shown that increasing access is essential for so many reasons.

Improving internet access now would have positive effects that last beyond the pandemic, Paykin said. Telehealth and online learning for children and adults are likely here to stay. “This almost surely won’t be our last pandemic,” she said, nor our last public health emergency. Whatever challenges may come, increased broadband internet access seems likely to help people through them.",voxdotcom,"['urban', 'deaths', 'areas', 'covid19', 'internet', 'link', 'access', 'broadband', 'health', 'rural', 'surprising', 'study', 'pandemic']",0

2022-03-09 21:10:06+00:00,10,"Scientists trying to zero in on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic have recently filled in some critical blanks. The findings aren’t a smoking gun and might not convince some people who think the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. But they provide the sharpest view yet of the early days of the outbreak.

In two February preprint papers, first reported by the New York Times, researchers traced the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19, in 2019 in Wuhan. One study looked at initial infections at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first cases were detected. The other examined the genomes of the earliest strains of the virus. Around the same time, researchers from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published their own findings from virus samples they collected from animals and the environment around the market in early 2020.

In addition to seafood, vendors at the market sold live animals, including those collected from remote wilderness areas.

Together, the studies connect the dots of transmission at the epicenter of the pandemic, observing that the virus likely made the leap from animals to humans more than once. “Once you understand that there were infected animals in the market, then multiple spillovers are not just a possibility, they’re what you would expect at that point,” Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University and a co-author on both papers, told Vox.

The studies’ conclusions contradict some early reports that the Huanan market was not the original locus of Covid-19. The results also echo how scientists think the first SARS virus spread to humans in 2002. According to Garry, they make the possibility that the outbreak began with a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology much less plausible.

The idea that a world-stopping virus escaped from a laboratory has sparked a heated debate among scientists, pundits, and politicians, fueled by accusations of bad faith, malfeasance, and cover-ups.

However, while researchers have narrowed down the location in the market where the outbreak likely began and have identified several potential animal hosts, they still haven’t found the specific animals that were infected. And though scientists have found several related viruses in the wild, they haven’t found one yet that they think could have directly spawned SARS-CoV-2.

But even without knowing exactly which animal ignited the pandemic, the new studies offer critical lessons in how new diseases emerge and point to potential routes for averting another global catastrophe.

Scientists have zeroed in on the stall where Covid-19 likely emerged

The recent studies investigated the earliest days of the pandemic, tracing the initial wave of infections in China. In particular, researchers paid close attention to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market. It’s part of the bustling live animal trade in Wuhan, a city of more than 8 million people. By one estimate, more than 47,000 animals across 38 species were sold in the city between May 2017 and November 2019, often suffering “poor welfare and hygiene conditions.” Bringing animals together from far-flung regions with inadequate sanitation and selling them to people for food, fur, or as pets is a recipe for breeding new diseases.

In one of the studies, researchers examined photographs, sales records, social media, genome sequences, surveys, and infection patterns around Wuhan in 2019. The researchers found not only that the initial Covid-19 cases emerged at the market, but that the “overwhelming majority were specifically linked to the western section of the Huanan market, where most of the live-mammal vendors were located.” The highest concentration of positive SARS-CoV-2 samples came from a single stall.

That section of the market was known to be selling Asian raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), hog badgers (Arctonyx albogularis), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) at the time of the outbreak, all animals that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

Researchers also studied the viruses themselves. From looking at the genomes of the viruses among the collected samples, they found that there were two distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, dubbed A and B, that were infecting people at the outset. Scientists think the B lineage formed after A, though B is not necessarily a descendant of A. Researchers estimated the probability that both lineages came from a single origin as 3.6 percent, meaning they likely followed separate evolutionary paths.

The first known human Covid-19 case was likely caused by B, which also became the dominant strain. The first known human infection caused by A occurred a week later.

The study from the Chinese CDC also confirmed that both lineages were spreading around the market. Together, the papers paint a new story of the early days of the pandemic, as Carl Zimmer and Benjamin Mueller at the New York Times wrote:

These findings came as a surprise. In the early days of the pandemic in China, the only Covid cases linked to the market appeared to be Lineage B. And because Lineage B seemed to have evolved after Lineage A, some researchers suggested that the virus arrived at the market only after spreading around Wuhan. But that logic is upended by the new Chinese study, which finds both lineages in market samples.

The distinct genomic sequences and the timing of the infections point to a scenario where SARS-CoV-2 made the jump into humans on two separate occasions at the Huanan market. One of the new papers raised the possibility that there may have been even more spillover events there.

Researchers say the results add weight to a natural origin of the virus and counter the lab leak theory

The latest round of research does have its limitations. Scientists noted that they may have missed some infections, since many Covid-19 cases don’t cause any symptoms at all. “For every one of the COVID-19 cases who became ill enough to be among the 174 hospitalized patients with illness onset in December of 2019, there were likely more than ten milder cases that went unnoticed,” researchers wrote in one of the preprint papers, neither of which has been peer-reviewed yet.

They are also working more than two years out from the initial outbreak, limiting what they could examine. And while they traced the virus to a specific area with live animals, the Chinese CDC observed that “no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the animal samples from the market.” The SARS-CoV-2 virus likely stems from a virus found in bats, and the most similar known bat virus was found last year in Laos.

“I think what they’re arguing could be true,” Jesse Bloom, a Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist, told the New York Times. “But I don’t think the quality of the data is sufficient to say that any of these scenarios are true with confidence.”

To date, it’s still unclear which animal served as the intermediate host that transmitted it to humans. And at this point, it may not be possible to find out since the specific infected animals were likely culled. “You’d have to be a time traveler or something like that to go back and see,” Garry said.

However, the findings do challenge the theory that the virus escaped from a laboratory. The lab leak hypothesis holds that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a facility roughly eight miles from the Huanan market. Proponents of the theory point to several factors. Researchers there were known to be studying bat coronaviruses. Specifically, they documented a bat coronavirus called RaTG13. Discovered in 2013, it has a genetic sequence with 96 percent overlap with SARS-CoV-2.

Scientists at the Wuhan Institute were also conducting experiments under lower safety conditions than most scientists would recommend for respiratory viruses. Some researchers argue that the types of experiments they were conducting constitute gain of function, where a virus is engineered to become more infectious.

Circumstantially, pathogens have escaped from Chinese laboratories before. And the Chinese government’s actions have added to the suspicions. They may have covered up the extent of the original outbreak, and international investigators have complained that the Chinese government still has not been fully transparent with what happened during the early days of the outbreak.

However, there appears to be no evidence the Wuhan Institute of Virology had an actual isolated sample of SARS-CoV-2, nor did they have any live ancestor to the virus, including RaTG13. They only recorded the genetic sequence.

The latest studies show also that the earliest clusters of the virus were concentrated in a specific area of the Huanan market. If the virus were introduced by a person from outside the market, environmental samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 would likely have been spread out more through the building.

In addition, the fact that two distinct lineages emerged in the early outbreak would require that someone from the lab would have had to introduce two different versions of the virus to the lab on two separate occasions.

“The simplest explanation is that infected animals infected people,” Garry said. “You have to go through quite a bit of mental gymnastics to go ‘it came from the lab to the market,’ and you have to believe that happened twice.”

We may never get a satisfactory answer, but we can prevent future pandemics

The frustrating reality is that a definitive origin story of Covid-19 may never emerge, and many of the critical bits of evidence are gone. The Huanan market has since been closed and sanitized and what little goodwill there was between Chinese authorities and outside investigators has dried up. This might be the closest we ever get to solving the mystery, and it won’t convince everyone.

But there are important lessons for how pandemics could arise. New diseases do naturally jump from animals to humans on occasion, but human action is heightening these risks. Farmers, property developers, miners, and poachers are encroaching into once-isolated wilderness areas, increasing the chances of contracting a novel disease from animals.

And the wildlife trade is particularly troublesome. The Huanan market illustrated what can happen when a variety of live animals are transported across vast distances and then stored in cages close to each other. It increases the odds of pathogens jumping between animals, mutating, and spreading to humans.

In such circumstances, spillovers are hardly natural events. However, it also means that measures such as restricting illegal wildlife trade and improving sanitation would help prevent future outbreaks.

At the same time, there are a number of things scientists around the world can do to enhance security around laboratories and clamp down on the possibilities of dangerous diseases escaping. That includes tactics like more robust biosafety protocols and greater transparency around virus research.

A lab leak and a spillover may not be equally likely, but the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic highlights how important it is to close off both of these routes. It’s not too soon to think about heading off the next global disease.",voxdotcom,"['likely', 'covid19s', 'animals', 'sarscov2', 'virus', 'view', 'covid19', 'huanan', 'scientists', 'researchers', 'origins', 'best', 'wuhan', 'market']",0
2022-03-07 18:33:01+00:00,39,"Share All sharing options for: Maternity wards are shuttering across the US during the pandemic

This story is part of The Aftermath, a Vox series about the collateral health effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in communities around the US. This series is supported in part by the NIHCM Foundation.

Across the country, from suburban San Diego to rural Connecticut, maternity wards have been shutting down for good during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This wave of closures has been building for years, but it appears to be accelerating during the pandemic. It could make birth even more dangerous in the US, which already sees far more deaths per capita among infants and pregnant women than comparably wealthy countries. And during the first year of the pandemic, the number of maternal deaths in the United States rose sharply. Researchers from the University of Minnesota have found when a labor and delivery department closes, there tend to be more emergency deliveries and more preterm births, which are the leading cause of infant mortality.

The losses are concentrated primarily in rural areas and communities of Black and Hispanic Americans, who are already less likely to have easy access to all kinds of health care services, including obstetrics. Before the recent closures, more than half of the rural counties in the United States already didn’t have a nearby hospital where babies could be delivered.

The decision to close a maternity ward is never simple. Hospitals that have closed their obstetrics (OB) departments in the past two years cite various factors, including declining birthrates. Some say they cannot find enough physicians and nurses to deliver babies, which would make it unsafe to continue offering those services.

But the pandemic looms over each of these closures. In public hearings, hospitals have pointed to the shortage of doctors, nurses, and health care workers they experienced during Covid-19 to justify their decisions. Sometimes, they have temporarily suspended services because of pandemic-related absences, only to later make the closure permanent. Pandemic relief funding that has helped stabilize hospitals’ finances is also starting to run out.

Some hospitals argue that these closures are not financially motivated, but labor and delivery services are not a moneymaker for them. More than 40 percent of births in the United States are covered by Medicaid, and the program’s low reimbursement rates have been cited in the past to explain a hospital’s decision to close its OB department.

There has been a general trend toward consolidation and specialization in hospitals; it’s cheaper to deliver babies at high-volume maternity departments than those in communities with declining birthrates. Those units sometimes enter a downward spiral before they close: Birthrates drop, making it harder to staff the obstetrics unit and more expensive to maintain these services. The staff’s skills start to atrophy with infrequent deliveries, and hospitals cite that risk when justifying a decision to close a maternity ward.

The consequences of these closures ripple out through the community. People in labor have to travel, sometimes for half an hour or even much more, to reach another hospital where they can have their baby. Doctors and families have shared stories about women who have given birth on the side of the road when they were unable to get to a facility in time.

The counties that are most likely to have an OB department close already have a smaller number of obstetricians and family physicians, so the loss of these services at the hospital further drains health care access from the area. Mothers in these communities also report that it is harder for them to get back to work and to find support for breastfeeding and child care.

Other effects are harder to quantify but nevertheless profound. The closure of a maternity ward can fracture the relationship between a trusted community institution and the people it is supposed to serve.

“There is a fundamental shift in a rural community when a hospital closes its OB unit,” Katy Backes Kozhimannil, a University of Minnesota professor who studies maternal mortality, told me. “It’s like a place where you can’t even be born. You can only die. The sense of that is really palpable.”

In Connecticut, a community in turmoil after its maternity ward shutters

When she went into labor in November 2020, Shantel Jones lived just blocks from the Windham Community Memorial Hospital in Windham County, Connecticut. Jones called for an ambulance; according to her mother, Michelle, the ambulance driver called the Windham hospital to let them know they were coming.

But the hospital’s maternity ward had stopped giving care earlier that year. Its last delivery was in June. The hospital told the driver not to come, Michelle says. They needed to go to Norwich, a 30-minute drive.

The ambulance started down Route 32, a winding road. But they didn’t make it to Norwich in time. Shantel ended up giving birth on the side of the road. It turned out the baby boy would need intensive care that the Norwich hospital could not provide. They were rerouted again to a hospital in Hartford, 30 more minutes away.

The baby and Shantel are fine, both living now with Michelle in New Orleans. But it was a harrowing experience, one that left Michelle in disbelief about the state of the community hospital in a town she had lived in for more than 30 years. She said she was still trying to correct her grandson’s birth certificate more than a year later, because local authorities disagree on where he was actually born.

“I felt really scared for her. I didn’t know what was going to happen,” Michelle said of Shantel. “When you have a city full of women who have to have babies, how are you going to do that?”

Windham County, once a textile mill boomtown, is a relatively rural and predominantly white area. But it is also home to many Black and Hispanic families and immigrants. The county’s schools have the highest proportion of students with English as a second language in Connecticut. Willimantic, the county seat, is 44 percent Hispanic and 7 percent Black. The story of the hospital’s closed maternity ward shows how care for people giving birth can unravel and the distrust and damage it leaves in its wake.

The saga begins in 2007, when the Hartford HealthCare system acquired the financially struggling nonprofit Windham hospital. Eight years later, its ICU unit was downgraded to a critical care unit that would not be capable of handling the same level of care that it had before. Local leaders objected at the time, but Hartford HealthCare said it was necessary to keep the hospital afloat and provide adequate care.

Community leaders now say that closure led to an exodus of critical staff, such as anesthesiologists, who can be vital to labor and delivery services. The main local OB/GYN practice eventually stopped delivering at Windham and moved to another hospital in nearby Manchester — they say because of the staffing woes.

When Hartford HealthCare made the decision to close the maternity ward permanently, after it stopped childbirth services in 2020, local health providers tried to come up with alternative plans, like proposing residency programs with UConn’s medical school. They told state regulators they were rebuffed by Hartford HealthCare; the hospital has said that the plan would have been impractical.

In Windham, a community coalition has formed to try to block the closure, arguing before a state board recently that the hospital failed to properly consult with its constituents before closing the ward and warning that the health care consequences could be dire. They see the closure as a premeditated, inevitable move meant to largely consolidate Hartford’s labor and delivery services at the William W. Backus Hospital in Norwich, a 30-minute drive from Windham.

Hospital executives, in those public hearings held over the department’s fate, tell it differently. They say they have tried to keep the ward open, but doing so was no longer tenable. The decision was not primarily a financial one, they say, although deliveries in Norwich cost about one-fourth what they do in Windham because a greater volume of patients creates cost efficiencies. Instead, they cite causes that are driving closed maternity wards across the country, starting with a low birthrate.

The number of births at Windham dropped from 374 in 2014 to fewer than 60 by halfway through 2020. When the main OB/GYN practice in the area decided it would deliver babies exclusively in Manchester, hospital leaders say it became difficult to properly staff the unit. The risk grew that with so few births, doctors’ and nurses’ skills would stagnate, which could lead to errors and worst outcomes. Experts say this risk is one common reason that OB departments close.

By November 2019, the Hartford HealthCare board was already talking about closing the ward permanently. Then came Covid-19, which its executives said in public hearings had made it more challenging to properly staff their facilities.

State regulators are still considering whether to permit the maternity ward’s closure; however, Hartford HealthCare has already been fined for closing the unit without state approval. The hospital system told me it could not comment on the record because of the pending state ruling.

In general, experts say the reasons given by Hartford HealthCare can be legitimate: Skills can deteriorate if hospital staff don’t get enough practice delivering babies. But they also warned of the risks of closing an obstetrics ward, both in the decreased access to care and in the fraying of the connection between the hospital and its patients.

“That risk doesn’t go away, but the risk is abandoned by the hospital,” Kozhimannil said. “If the hospital doesn’t grapple with that, I think there is real damage to the relationship.”

Those bonds are breaking in Windham, compounded by a feeling that the town has lost control of its own community hospital, a common theme in these closures.

In 2000, there were around 30 independent nonprofit hospitals in the state, including Windham, says Lynne Ide, who studies policy at the Universal Health Care Foundation in Connecticut and opposes the closure in Windham. Now there are four, the rest subsumed into larger hospital systems. Hartford HealthCare was recently sued by a group of citizens and another hospital, who alleged its consolidations have led to anti-competitive practices.

The hospital system is pledging to continue providing prenatal and postnatal services to Windham’s mothers and to provide transportation for mothers who need to travel to Norwich or Manchester (also about a 30-minute drive away) or another hospital in order to deliver.

But advocates argue that one of the routes from Windham goes along Route 6, which has become known locally as “Suicide 6” because of the high number of fatal accidents. Town council members have called Hartford HealthCare “vulture capitalists.” The hospital has in turn said there has been widespread misinformation about the closure.

“These institutions are making these siloed decisions without collaborating,” said Rose Reyes, a Willimantic town council member who is part of the coalition trying to stop the closure. “Without input, without respecting and deferring to the community.”

Maternity ward closures nationwide are putting patients at risk

Windham is just one example of a widespread trend.

In Texas, at least six rural hospitals have limited or suspended their obstetrics services in the past few years. According to the Texas Tribune, only 40 percent of rural hospitals in the state have a labor and delivery unit. Some patients must drive hundreds of miles to give birth. One woman gave birth in the parking lot of a hospital, after driving an hour to reach it, according to a hospital executive in the Texas Panhandle.

North Carolina lost at least nine maternity wards since 2013, before the pandemic; another closed in mid-2020. A hospital in Lowville, New York, was forced to suspend its labor and delivery services in September 2021 after an exodus of nurses who refused to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Several OB departments have closed in Florida hospitals during the pandemic, including one that suspended the services because of a Covid-related staffing shortage, then later closed permanently. In those cases, as in Windham, hospitals insist they were making the best decision for patients, even as some of their own doctors protested the closure.

The same story has played out in rural Ohio, in suburban San Diego and in southeastern Pennsylvania, where a closure will mean the number of hospitals with birthing units has been cut in half in the past 20 years.

More closures could be coming. Leslie Marsh, CEO of a rural hospital in Lexington, Nebraska, told me that facilities in her area have either already shut down their labor and delivery services or began discussing whether they would. She says she wants to keep providing it because she believes it is important for the community, especially after another hospital about 45 minutes away closed its maternity ward.

But 80 percent of new mothers who deliver at her hospital are on Medicaid, which has the lowest reimbursement rates of any insurer in the US. And Covid-19 has strained their ability to staff the department.

“You begin to ask the question: Can we offer OB services anymore?” she said. “That will likely be the reason we would stop doing OB services, if staffing shortages were such that we could no longer manage.”

Nobody is tallying in real time the number of obstetrics departments that shutter during the pandemic. But experts believe the downward trend seen before the pandemic may be getting worse.

The research conducted by Kozhimannil’s team on the effect of pre-pandemic closures would suggest that these closures are going to lead to worse outcomes for mothers and their babies and worsen access in the areas already struggling. The closures hit the least populated counties with the fewest doctors. They also tended to have a higher proportion of Black women who were of a reproductive age.

The researchers found that even when there was another nearby hospital for deliveries, there was still an initial spike in people delivering in the emergency room. Although the rate declined over time, it remained meaningfully higher than before the obstetrics closure.

In hospitals that did not have a nearby facility, there was an increase in the number of out-of-hospital births — maybe planned but maybe not. It is a worrisome trend, since rural communities already have higher infant and maternal mortality rates. After an OB ward closed, preterm births also increased, Kozhimannil’s team’s research found, a metric linked to greater infant mortality.

Those are the stakes in each of these decisions. Hospitals can try to ameliorate the consequences by offering transportation and other services and by working to make sure the community is prepared for that transition.

But if those efforts falter, as Kozhimannil told me, there can be long-term damage.

Windham’s community leaders fear they are facing such a future. They worry what the hospital’s maternity ward closure will mean for both expectant parents and the community at large. Reyes said she believed the town would not be able to live up to its full potential and its 10-year economic development plan would end up squandered.

“The residents of the community are actually astonished,” Leah Ralls, head of the local NAACP and one of the members of the Windham coalition, told me. “What do you mean you can’t have a baby in Windham?

2022-03-04 22:13:33+00:00,5,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has destabilized European security and the global energy market — and now food could be next.

Dozens of countries across the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa that already suffer from food insecurity rely on Russia’s and Ukraine’s bountiful supplies of wheat, corn, and vegetable oil, and experts say the conflict could send food prices rising and increase global hunger.

“It’s yet one more instance of conflict surfacing in the world at a time when the world just can’t sustain it,” said Steve Taravella, senior spokesperson at the World Food Programme (WFP) of the United Nations. “Hunger rates are rising significantly globally, and one of the largest drivers of hunger is manmade conflict.”

Even before the conflict, global food prices were already at their highest point since 2011, thanks to volatile climate conditions like droughts and overly heavy rainfall, as well as the broader supply chain disruptions created by Covid-19. With 855 million people already suffering from food insecurity, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes at an challenging moment for global hunger. The disruption in food production also puts Ukrainians — at least 100,000 of whom have already been displaced — at higher risk of hunger, underscoring the strong link between conflict and food insecurity.

What happens next depends on the progress of the war and the financial sanctions being put into place against Russia, and experts warn against predicting how exactly the conflict will affect global food prices and supplies. But given Russia’s and Ukraine’s enormous roles in providing food for the world — particularly wheat — instability in the region’s food production and exports could have consequences that will go well beyond the theater of war.

When farms become a battleground

To get a sense of just how critical Ukraine’s and Russia’s farmers are to the rest of the world, you have to understand just how much they export.

Ukraine and Russia are top exporters of major grains and vegetable oils, according to a Vox analysis of the food export data from International Trade Centre in 2020. The two countries account for the majority of the world’s sunflower-seed oil exports, while Russia is the world’s largest wheat exporter. Combined, Ukraine and Russia were responsible for about 26 percent of global wheat exports in 2020.

Wheat and corn prices were on the rise before the war. On February 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine, Chicago wheat futures spiked to their highest level since the beginning of the year. (They’ve since fallen — a partial sign of how much volatility war can inject into global food markets.)

Ukraine and Russia are important food suppliers for low- and middle-income countries in which tens of millions of people are already food insecure. Prices are further rising due to the conflict, and more increases as the war continues could cause greater food instability and hunger — not only in Ukraine, but around the world.

Egypt and Turkey rely on combined Russian/Ukrainian imports for 70 percent of their wheat supply, while 95 percent of Ukraine’s wheat exports went to Asia (including the Middle East) or Africa in 2020. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Yemen, Libya, and Lebanon rely on Ukraine for a high percentage of their wheat supply, while Egypt imports more than half its wheat from either Russia or Ukraine. Countries in South and Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and Bangladesh, are also heavily reliant on wheat from the region. The largest importers of Ukrainian wheat in 2020 were Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan, while Russia is the source of a large percentage of wheat for many sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria and Sudan.

Disruptions in these exports will likely only increase the food insecurity already experienced by these countries. According to the WFP, nearly half of Yemen’s 30 million people get insufficient food. In Bangladesh, 29 million people get insufficient food, and over 30 percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished. Indonesia and Egypt, respectively, are home to 26 million and 10 million people with insufficient food consumption, while over a quarter of Nigeria’s population — 55 million people, more than the entire population of Ukraine — have insufficient food consumption.

According to Alex Smith, a food and agriculture analyst at the tech-focused environmental think tank the Breakthrough Institute, rising wheat prices in countries with already high levels of food insecurity could be particularly devastating. In Yemen, where a long-running conflict was already worsening food insecurity, this is an “added bad element to an already bad scenario,” Smith said. In Libya, a supply disruption and higher prices would add to the existing food insecurity by limiting “the already food insecure people from getting the small amount of food they already are able to get and also puts more people into the category of food insecure,” he added.

Lebanon, whose wheat silos were destroyed two years ago in the Beirut port explosion and which relies on Ukraine for more than half its wheat, is already seeking alternative import deals, but hunger may increase anywhere that a government can’t afford to substitute wheat they were previously getting from Ukraine.

Russia is also the largest fertilizer exporter in the world, and pre-conflict fertilizer price spikes, according to Shirley Mustafa, an economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have already been contributing to the rise in food prices. Further disruption to fertilizer production or exports would damage agriculture in Europe, potentially contributing to even higher food prices around the world.

Ukrainian agriculture is more likely to be affected by direct conflict than Russia as farmers are pushed off their farms, while port closures are already limiting exports. “In two-three weeks farmers could start the planting season in Ukraine,” Iurii Mykhailov, a Kyiv resident, reported in Successful Farming. “But the Russian invasion changed everything. Because of military hostilities there are going to be big shortages of fuel and fertilizers. There certainly will be a lack of loans. There even may be a shortage of machine operators because of military losses, etc.”

Russian farmers are unlikely to be directly affected by conflict, said Smith, but the country’s exports could be affected in other ways. “The [region’s] major exporters — Ukraine, Russia, and Romania — ship grain from ports in the Black Sea, which could face disruptions from any possible military operation,” another WFP spokesperson told me on February 24; since then, Ukraine has already shut down ports and ships have been damaged by attacks.

“I think there’s less risk that sanctions will stop wheat exports from Russia,” Smith told me. “The real concern to me is actually whether Russia will choose to stop exports themselves in the case of sanctions or the conflict driving economic hardship for the Russian population, in which case Putin could just say we’re going to curb exports down as much as we can to keep prices of food low in Russia.”

This would not be unprecedented. Following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Russia temporarily halted grain exports for a few months, and the country stopped exports for almost a year in 2010 after a series of droughts and wildfires. That decision raised prices around the world — and not only among Russian grain importers.

How conflict raises the price of bread

Global food prices have been almost continuously rising since June 2020, said Mustafa, who works on the FAO Food Price Index, which measures monthly changes in international food prices of a basket of commodities. The FAO Food Price Index is now the highest it has been since 2011.

The rise has been due to a multitude of factors, including the weather anomalies created by the La Niña climate pattern, which has led to too little water in places like South America and too much in Southeast Asia. In the wheat sector, the US and Canada, two vital producers, were also hit by drought. Covid-19 has also continued to be a factor on both the supply and demand sides.

Conflict has historically been a driver of food price hikes. Researchers reported in a study that looked at 113 African markets between 1997-2010 that “feedback exists between food price and political violence: higher food prices increase conflict within markets, and conflict increases food price.” Other researchers have shown that the rise in food insecurity beginning in 2014 across sub-Saharan Africa was attributable to violent conflict, which increased in relative importance compared to drought from 2009-2018. A feedback cycle exists as well: Food price increases driven by war contribute to further conflict even in places that weren’t involved in the original war themselves.

Mustafa told me the effects of disruption depend on where the crop supply is concentrated. For example, if there’s a high level of export concentration, other countries are not able to compensate for the disruption, but if there are lots of exporters, other countries could make up the difference. “It also depends on the type of disruption you see — the length of it, the duration. If it’s relatively short-term, markets could potentially adapt rather quickly. If it’s a little bit of a longer-term disruption concentrated in just a few players, then you could potentially also see the disruption stimulate production elsewhere to compensate.”

A hungrier world is a less stable one

In a worst-case scenario, the disruption to commodity prices could also contribute to conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders in countries that heavily rely on its producers for grain. Not only does conflict cause higher food prices; higher food prices can contribute to conflict even in areas of the world that are not directly affected by the original event. Researchers Jasmien de Winne and Gert Peersman found that increases in food prices due to harvest shocks outside of African countries heighten violence within them.

“Although most violence does probably not occur because of higher food prices, but are caused by broader economic conditions or political grievances,” the authors write, “these income shocks can be a trigger to engage in violent events.”

Mustafa said that while the FAO was monitoring the situation, the agency could not give predictions on the specific crisis given the uncertainties in the situation. Taravella similarly said the WFP was in “watch and see mode,” and is ready to provide emergency assistance as soon as feasible.

The reality is that hunger almost always follows conflict. And when that conflict occurs in a major agricultural exporter like Ukraine and involves another like Russia, the victims could ultimately go far beyond the two countries at war.",voxdotcom,"['disruption', 'russian', 'ukraine', 'conflict', 'invasion', 'mean', 'global', 'prices', 'food', 'hunger', 'russia', 'wheat', 'countries', 'world', 'exports']",0

2022-02-24 18:00:38+00:00,6,"The US has a booster problem. Less than half of all American adults — 42 percent — say they have received an additional dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Among vaccinated people, that share is 70 percent. Better but a long way from ideal.

That is in spite of evidence that an additional dose provided more protection against the omicron variant. Even among all Americans over 65 years old, the group most likely to see a drop in effectiveness from the initial two doses, the percentage that’s received booster shot is 66 percent. The US vaccination campaign is now trailing far behind our peers in the United Kingdom, where more than 85 percent of people over 65 have gotten their booster.

As Sarah Zhang wrote in the Atlantic earlier this month, the most obvious pandemic strategy for the US going forward is to vaccinate and boost more people, especially the elderly who are most at risk. Eric Topol, the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the lagging booster rate “has been one of the most serious disappointments” in the US response.

But why has it been such a struggle? Digging into the KFF polling data, it appears the United States has two distinct challenges in boosting more people.

One problem is a matter of convenience and timing. Some people say they are not yet eligible for a booster because their second dose was too recent and/or they face practical obstacles to getting another shot, such as taking time off work or finding an appointment.

The other may be a thornier problem: Some of the people who are vaccinated but not boosted say they don’t think boosters work. They have heard stories about breakthrough infections among the vaccinated and decided that it isn’t worth the time and effort to get another shot.

Let’s take them one at a time.

Part of the issue is timing: The US is still vaccinating new people every day, so some people haven’t had enough time pass since their second shot to get their third. The CDC recommends people wait five months before receiving a booster. Among people who are vaccinated but not boosted, about 40 percent say they will get a third shot as soon as they can.

The time restriction seems to be the biggest thing holding back people who want to get their boosters ASAP or are generally open to it (saying they want to wait and see). But other factors are at play. Other common reasons for not getting a booster among that group are being too busy, not having enough time to get the shot, and not having gotten around to it yet.

Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than white Americans to say time or convenience has held them back from getting boosted. Public health experts have been saying for months that giving people paid sick leave to people who do want to go get their vaccines would be an easy way to increase vaccination rates.

Those figures give some reason for optimism: A lot of people do want to get boosters and say they will, especially if it can be made more convenient.

But there are some worrisome signals in the survey data as well. About 40 percent of vaccinated but not boosted Americans say that they will not get another dose under any circumstances or would do so only if it’s required.

Among that group, there are two dominant reasons given: Either people don’t think they need the booster and aren’t at risk from Covid-19 (22 percent of the definitely not/only if required cohort) or they don’t think boosters are effective because vaccinated people are still getting sick (19 percent).

Political polarization may also be playing a critical role in these sentiments: Among the vaccinated but not boosted Americans, a much smaller share of Republicans say they will get their booster as soon as they can (18 percent) compared to independents (35 percent) and Democrats (58 percent).

Some of this persuasion problem has been self-created by the government and public health authorities. There has been confusion about the booster guidelines, about the nature of breakthrough infections, and a general distrust toward public health authorities that has grown during the pandemic because of an ongoing failure to be direct and honest with the public from the beginning.

But it also reflects the informational echo chambers that many Americans live in, where stories that support a preferred viewpoint (the vaccines aren’t effective) take prominence over the numerous studies that affirm the value of getting your shots.

The takeaway should be that the US can take simple steps — giving people time off or following up when it’s time for somebody to get their booster shot — to increase the share of its population who have full protection against Covid-19.

But it will be hard to reach the standards set by the UK and other wealthy countries so long as many Americans don’t trust the information given to them by public health institutions.",voxdotcom,"['big', 'reasons', 'americas', 'vaccinated', 'public', 'americans', 'rates', 'health', 'lagging', 'boosted', 'say', 'problem', 'booster', 'getting', 'shot']",0

2022-02-14 17:49:53+00:00,12,"Steve Serrao, chief of gastroenterology at a hospital in Moreno Valley, California, just lived through the fourth wave of Covid-19 with the omicron variant sweeping across the country. Patients in respiratory distress once again filled the hospital’s beds.

But it is another wave, one that’s starting to trickle in but is still a long way from cresting, that Serrao worries about most. He fears that the delayed diagnoses of various cancers and other chronic, life-threatening illnesses — the result of Covid-19’s disruption to routine checkups and screenings — will be the next crisis that overwhelms the US health system.

“Our next surge will be advanced chronic disease,” Serrao told me over the phone. “That’s going to be the next surge of patients who overwhelm our system. I don’t think our systems are ready.”

The Covid-19 pandemic dealt a crushing blow to the preventive services that can catch potential health problems before they become life-threatening. Screenings for several major cancers fell significantly during 2020, according to a study published in December 2021 in the journal Cancer. Colonoscopies dropped by nearly half compared to 2019, prostate biopsies by more than 25 percent. New diagnoses declined by 13 percent to 23 percent, depending on the cancer — not because there was less cancer in the world, but because less of it was being detected. The screening backlog was still growing by the end of 2020, according to this recent study, albeit at a slower rate.

“I think we are absolutely in uncharted territory,” Brian Englum, a University of Maryland surgeon who co-authored the new Cancer study, told me. “There are no examples I know of where we have seen numbers change this dramatically.”

The fear among doctors is that the pandemic’s disruption to cancer screenings and other preventive measures won’t just be a blip, although a blip would be bad enough on its own: When cancer gets diagnosed late, it’s less likely a patient’s doctors can successfully intervene, and the patient is more likely to die. Even a four-week delay in treatment is associated with a 6 to 13 percent higher risk of death.

But they also fear that the missed screenings will lead to a more permanent disconnect between patients and the health system. Research has found that when patients lose their primary care doctor, they tend to end up in the hospital more, with more serious health problems. People who have skipped appointments or didn’t get screenings or care may be less likely to seek it in the future, and the problems could compound.

It may take years for the consequences to become clear. Before the pandemic, some physicians questioned if the US might be conducting too many screenings. But the country is now being forced to undergo an unintended natural experiment in less screening, one with thousands of lives at stake. The collateral damage of a pandemic that has killed more than 900,000 Americans could grow even more.

“We could be years into this before we know there’s a problem,” Englum said, “and we’ve already lost a lot of people.”

“How many of these cases are out there? Nobody knows.”

Serrao described one of his patients as a Hispanic man in his 40s. When he first noticed bleeding in early 2020, the patient talked to his primary care doctor, who told him it might be hemorrhoids, Serrao said. The primary care doctor acknowledged that getting a cancer screening would be impossible on short notice because the local hospitals were so strained with Covid-19. And the patient feared he might get sick if he went to a hospital.

Ultimately, it was 18 months before the patient sought a colonoscopy. He was diagnosed with what was, by then, advanced rectal cancer, Serrao said.

If the man had come in right away, Serrao said, he might have been cancer-free after a simple polyp removal. Instead, the doctor and his team are now battling cancer that has moved into other parts of the patient’s body. His outlook is much worse than it would have been if the cancer had been caught sooner.

“How many of these cases are out there? Nobody knows,” Serrao said.

Serrao’s patient had the misfortune to notice symptoms amid the biggest disruption of medical care in US history — one that hit cancer screenings particularly hard. In April 2020, as many hospitals canceled services in order to prepare for the expected surge of Covid-19 patients, the number of colonoscopies plummeted 93 percent. Then, after a brief rebound, the late 2020 winter wave stretched hospitals and forced them to limit services. By the end of the year, there had been 133,231 fewer colonoscopies performed in 2020 compared to the 2019 baseline, 62,793 fewer chest CT scans, and 49,334 fewer fecal blood tests.

“The drop-off in screenings has made me born again on the importance of screening,” John Marshall, chief of oncology at Georgetown University Hospital, told me. “We’re seeing more advanced diagnoses, and people presenting at a stage where they no longer can be cured.”

It will take months for the backlog to be cleared. Carrie Saia, the CEO of a community hospital in Holton, Kansas, told me that one of her facility’s gastroenterologists had been recruited by a larger Kansas City hospital to “scope from 7 in the morning to whenever at night, doing nothing but scopes.”

“They’re 1,000 people behind and backlogged right now,” Saia said. “A certain percentage out of those patients are going to have cancer growing.”

And working to clear that backlog begets a new backlog. Patients who are just now seeking a screening are finding it harder to get appointments. Marshall said he knew of patients who first experienced symptoms in September, were recommended for a screening by their doctor, but still couldn’t get an appointment as of December because there are so many patients in need of colonoscopies, MRIs, and other screening procedures.

Covid-19 led to direct rationing in overwhelmed hospitals last summer; they were unable to take patients with acute medical emergencies and couldn’t find another facility to take them. But this more subtle kind of rationing — delaying necessary services for months because the backlog has grown so large — also takes its toll, forcing doctors to make hard choices about which patients to prioritize.

“Everything is harder,” Marshall said. “We’ve had to make trade-off and priority decisions about who’s getting the treatment before the other person, decisions we would never have had to make.”

Covid-19’s disruption of US health care is likely going to deepen disparities

Serrao practices at the Riverside University Health System in Riverside County, about an hour and a half drive from downtown Los Angeles. Roughly two-thirds of his patients are Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander. Almost all of them have government insurance, either Medicare or Medicaid.

Black Americans already experience a higher incidence of and a higher mortality from colorectal cancers than white Americans. Black and Hispanic patients also tend to be diagnosed with more advanced lung cancers than their white peers, they have higher mortality from breast cancer, and they receive fewer prostate exams. At each stage, from preventive screenings to death rates, disparities already existed.

“They already have health disparities on a good day,” Serrao told me. “These last couple of years have put them back multiple years. The setback is quite profound.”

Over the course of the pandemic, Serrao’s practice struggled to make a dent in the backlog. Just as they would gain some momentum, another surge of Covid-19 would interrupt their progress.

Last January, the GI unit at his hospital was converted to a recovery area for patients receiving radiation therapy and other cancer treatments because overflow Covid-19 patients were in the space usually reserved for oncology recovery patients. As a result, he and his team couldn’t perform any screenings.

It was a necessary step — the top priority was maintaining treatment for patients already diagnosed with cancer — but it required the postponement of screenings to identify new cancer cases. The backlog got bigger.

“I’m almost certain that there are population pockets out there that have high disparities with cancer that will show up in the next year, two years, three years with more advanced cancers,” Serrao said, “and that’s because of the disruption in health care.”

The US will be living with the fallout of delayed cancer screenings for years

That problem may only be getting worse over time. Englum told me that one of the more troubling implications of their findings is that cancer screenings did not return to their pre-pandemic normal by the end of 2020.

It wasn’t a two- or three-month blip during the worst of the outbreak. By the end of the year, the drop in screenings looked more and more like a permanent setback. It’s the same problem we’re seeing with routine vaccinations: people who missed their shots and aren’t catching up even as we enter a new post-Covid normal.

“What our study shows is not only did we not make up for the blip, we didn’t even get back to baseline by the end of 2020,” Englum said. “We kept losing ground.”

The US health system struggled before the pandemic with managing people’s care in a timely fashion. It requires having an established relationship with a primary care doctor — which fewer and fewer Americans do — and then staying on schedule with recommended preventive screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms. As of 2018, according to a federal study, only 8 percent of Americans were receiving all the preventive services that are recommended for them.

Americans have now lived through two years when their primary care practice might have been closed, permanently or temporarily. The hospitals where they would have gotten a colonoscopy were postponing those non-emergent procedures. Some of them may have been afraid to go to the doctor or hospital, knowing that a highly transmissible virus was on the loose.

That only makes the challenge of getting people to stay on top of their health care harder. Doctors worry that people’s habits may be permanently changed by the pandemic — and not for the better.

“I am fearful that once people got out of that habit, they didn’t see an immediate problem,” Englum told me. “Then they say, ‘Well, I haven’t seen my doctor for six months or a year and nothing happened. I feel fine.’ They’re just out of the habit. They lost the routine.”

That means the health system is flying blind. Unless people get back in the habit of getting their recommended screenings, doctors will lose ground every year in identifying patients with serious conditions or at risk of developing them. That would limit their ability to get ahead of emerging health problems before they become chronic or even life-threatening.

In theory, Englum pointed out, this also could be an opportunity to learn whether the current screening guidelines are actually appropriate. If 10 years were to pass and there were no appreciable increase in cancer mortality, for example, maybe we could revise our recommendations for colonoscopies from every 10 years to every 12. The pandemic would have provided evidence such a delay doesn’t present a big risk at the population level.

That kind of reevaluation is happening across the health system. Health insurers are monitoring the outcomes for patients who delayed kidney treatment because of Covid-19. They are watching for any negative effects, but also for countervailing evidence that might indicate the missed care was actually unnecessary.

At every level, the pandemic has forced a natural experiment in what a disruption to the usual treatment plan means for patient outcomes. We are going to learn a lot, like it or not. The risk is that those lessons will come at the cost of thousands of lives.

Because the flip side of the optimistic scenario is that in 10 years’ time, we will see cancer mortality increasing as a result of delayed screenings.

“By then,” Englum said, “you’ve lost the opportunity to treat however many thousands of people.”",voxdotcom,"['surge', 'advanced', 'screening', 'cancer', 'screenings', 'health', 'patients', 'pandemic', 'ready', 'system', 'isnt', 'care', 'doctor', 'told', 'serrao']",0

It requires having an established relationship with a primary care doctor — which fewer and fewer Americans do — and then staying on schedule with recommended preventive screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms. As of 2018, according to a federal study, only 8 percent of Americans were receiving all the preventive services that are recommended for them.

Americans have now lived through two years when their primary care practice might have been closed, permanently or temporarily. The hospitals where they would have gotten a colonoscopy were postponing those non-emergent procedures. Some of them may have been afraid to go to the doctor or hospital, knowing that a highly transmissible virus was on the loose.

That only makes the challenge of getting people to stay on top of their health care harder. Doctors worry that people’s habits may be permanently changed by the pandemic — and not for the better.

“I am fearful that once people got out of that habit, they didn’t see an immediate problem,” Englum told me. “Then they say, ‘Well, I haven’t seen my doctor for six months or a year and nothing happened. I feel fine.’ They’re just out of the habit. They lost the routine.”

That means the health system is flying blind. Unless people get back in the habit of getting their recommended screenings, doctors will lose ground every year in identifying patients with serious conditions or at risk of developing them. That would limit their ability to get ahead of emerging health problems before they become chronic or even life-threatening.

In theory, Englum pointed out, this also could be an opportunity to learn whether the current screening guidelines are actually appropriate. If 10 years were to pass and there were no appreciable increase in cancer mortality, for example, maybe we could revise our recommendations for colonoscopies from every 10 years to every 12. The pandemic would have provided evidence such a delay doesn’t present a big risk at the population level.

That kind of reevaluation is happening across the health system. Health insurers are monitoring the outcomes for patients who delayed kidney treatment because of Covid-19. They are watching for any negative effects, but also for countervailing evidence that might indicate the missed care was actually unnecessary.

At every level, the pandemic has forced a natural experiment in what a disruption to the usual treatment plan means for patient outcomes. We are going to learn a lot, like it or not. The risk is that those lessons will come at the cost of thousands of lives.

Because the flip side of the optimistic scenario is that in 10 years’ time, we will see cancer mortality increasing as a result of delayed screenings.

“By then,” Englum said, “you’ve lost the opportunity to treat however many thousands of people.”",voxdotcom,"['surge', 'advanced', 'screening', 'cancer', 'screenings', 'health', 'patients', 'pandemic', 'ready', 'system', 'isnt', 'care', 'doctor', 'told', 'serrao']",0
2022-02-11 12:01:16+00:00,7,"Vaccines were supposed to be a game changer for Covid-19 in schools. Back in the more innocent days of spring 2021, it seemed as though once the shots were approved for children, education could pretty much go back to normal — kids would get vaccinated, infections would drop, quarantines would become unnecessary, and teachers and families alike could settle into a new normal that looked a lot like the old one.

It didn’t happen exactly like that. Right now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone age 5 and older get vaccinated against Covid-19. The Food and Drug Administration has given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine full approval for people 16 and older, and emergency use authorization (a form of limited approval that still requires data showing a treatment is safe and effective) for children 5 to 15. However, families have been slow to vaccinate their kids; by early February, just 22 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds were fully vaccinated.

At the same time, the omicron variant has increased transmission, driven up cases, and forced closures of classrooms, schools, and even entire districts due to quarantines, staffing shortages, and labor disputes. The surge now appears to be easing, but it’s still far from normal out there.

All this has led to renewed debate about vaccines in public schools. Should they be required for attendance? Would such requirements stand up in court? Will we ever get to a place where Covid-19 vaccines will be considered standard for schoolchildren the way measles vaccines are today?

These are all difficult questions, but after years of a pandemic and months of a vaccination program, experts have some insight into the future — as well as some lessons from the past. “I have to believe that we will get to a point where a lot of things related to Covid” — including vaccines — “are routine,” said Ibukun Kalu, a pediatric infectious disease physician and professor at Duke University. “I just don’t know when that will be.”

Why is the Covid-19 vaccine important for kids?

In some ways, it’s not surprising that Covid-19 vaccines for children have been a tougher sell than those for adults. Children are less likely to become severely ill from Covid-19, perhaps decreasing the urgency of vaccination for some families. What’s more, parents are often more anxious and cautious about their children’s health than their own, said Richard Meckel, an emeritus professor of American studies at Brown, who has studied the history of childhood and health policy. Parents who were willing to get vaccinated themselves may be more concerned about side effects when it comes to their children.

However, public health experts emphasize that vaccinating children against Covid-19 is important for them, their families, and their communities. “We do not want to leave children as the only group susceptible to an infection,” Kalu said. Vaccinations help protect children from Covid-19 (which can be severe in younger people, even if it’s less common), as well as protecting the entire population by bringing up the percentage of people who have some immunity. Also, kids will become adults one day: Doctors begin vaccinating people for many diseases as children, Kalu said, so they can build up their protection over time.

Indeed, Covid-19 vaccines are no different from the other vaccines children typically need to get in order to attend public school, which include TDAP (a vaccine that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), polio, and varicella (chickenpox). Vaccinations are one of the ways that public health officials “keep all children, across age groups across all of our different demographics, attending school safely,” Kalu said. “There is no reason why a vaccine-preventable illness, which SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 is becoming — should be taken out of that equation that we’ve all accepted for years and years.”

So are school districts requiring vaccines?

Nonetheless, Covid-19 is outside that equation, at least for now: Vaccination against the virus, especially for kids, remains a politically charged issue. In part because of this, public school districts have been slow to add the vaccine to their lists of required shots. (In some cases, private schools have more leeway to make their own decisions, and some have imposed mandates.)

In fact, they’ve been moving in the opposite direction: A number of districts, like those in Oakland and San Diego, announced vaccine mandates for students and then pushed back their deadlines, said Bree Dusseault, principal at the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), which has been tracking Covid-19 policies at 100 large districts nationwide. In many cases, the reason is simply low vaccination rates. In Oakland, for example, so many children remained unvaccinated that it would have been impossible to accommodate them at the district’s virtual school.

So far, New Orleans is the only large school district that CRPE is aware of in which a vaccine mandate has actually gone into effect, Dusseault said. That mandate started on February 1, and students will be able to obtain a waiver for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons, so it may take some time to know what effect, if any, the rule will have. Still, the district is “one to watch” to gauge the impact of mandates in the months ahead, Dusseault said.

What about teacher vaccination mandates?

Vaccination requirements for teachers and staff have been less controversial than student mandates, but only slightly. As of last December, 17 districts in CRPE’s sample required teachers and staff to be vaccinated, while another 28 required them to be vaccinated or test regularly.

Though teachers unions have often pushed for stricter Covid-19 protocols during the pandemic, such as distancing and testing, their stance on vaccine mandates has been more complicated.

The largest national teachers unions have been broadly supportive of vaccinations, but they have not come out in favor of mandates for teachers and staff, said Bradley Marianno, a professor of education policy and leadership at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. In part that’s to give local unions flexibility in their bargaining: “If a school district wants a vaccine mandate for teachers, the union’s going to see what they can negotiate along the way” in return, Marianno said.

That position on staff mandates makes it harder for unions to push for student mandates because they could be seen as hypocritical. The situation also varies by region, Marianno said, with some local unions in the West and Northeast coming out in favor of teacher mandates. Meanwhile, “you won’t see unions in the southern half of the United States necessarily come out in favor of vaccine mandates for their membership, because they know where some of their membership stands on that issue,” Marianno said. Local variations in support for teacher mandates “largely align with the politics you would expect them to align with.”

Will more districts require Covid-19 vaccines in the future?

Like everything related to the pandemic, school vaccination policies change all the time, and what’s true today may not be the case tomorrow. For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last year that as of July 2022, children in the state would have to be vaccinated to attend school. It’s possible that the state mandate will give districts more impetus — and political cover — to enact and enforce their own mandates, Dusseault said.

At the same time, the California mandate will only take effect if the FDA grants full approval to vaccines for children. It also currently only applies to students in 7th through 12th grade.

Meanwhile, 17 states have taken the opposite approach, banning Covid-19 vaccine mandates in schools. In these states, which include Texas, Georgia, and Florida, districts couldn’t require the vaccine even if they wanted to. The federal government is unlikely to step in; any effort by the Biden administration to require vaccines for public school students would likely generate enormous conservative backlash and be blocked by the Supreme Court. (The Court in January blocked a Biden administration rule requiring school districts and other employers to mandate vaccines or testing for staff.)

All of this means that vaccination policies will likely be a state-by-state patchwork for some time to come. To understand what’s coming — and to help districts craft policies that work — it helps to understand what’s gone before.

How did school vaccine requirements come about in the first place?

Vaccines and anti-vaccine sentiment have a long history in America. The first method of vaccination, practiced during the colonial period, involved intentionally infecting yourself with smallpox in order to — hopefully — get a mild case and gain immunity, said Meckel, the Brown professor. One popular method was “arm to arm,” lancing a smallpox pustule on a sick person’s arm and rubbing the resulting pus into a cut on the skin of a healthy person. This was, obviously, disgusting, and sometimes the (formerly) healthy person ended up dying of smallpox. Many people feared and opposed the practice for these reasons.

Over time, though, vaccines became more sophisticated and effective, and in the 19th century, cities began requiring them for public school attendance as part of a larger effort to control epidemics. This, too, inspired backlash. Some parents were worried about the safety of vaccines — which, though better than the old slice-open-a-boil technique, were poorly regulated and sometimes contaminated. Others had more ideological objections.

The 19th century saw “a kind of health reform that was centered on the idea of resisting toxins and purifying the body,” and “the state forcefully putting something into your body” went against that, Meckel said. At the same time, there was a growing resistance to organized medicine, and to state power more generally.

The result was a series of court battles, culminating in the 1922 Supreme Court decision Zucht v. King, which upheld a school vaccination mandate in Texas. That case set a precedent that stands today, Meckel said: A school district has the legal right to require vaccines for attendance.

Even after Zucht v. King, however, enforcement of mandates remained a challenge, and districts were forced to create a number of exceptions to the rules, Meckel said. In contrast, there’s another approach that could have more success today.

Short of mandates, how can schools encourage families to vaccinate kids?

While cities required vaccination against smallpox, another vaccine — against diphtheria — remained largely voluntary, Meckel said. Instead of mandates, public health officials in the 1920s “borrowed from the new advertising and motion picture industry to essentially pass on the message that you were a good parent if you got your child vaccinated.”

That kind of large-scale public relations campaign might be what’s needed when it comes to Covid-19, Meckel said. Mandates, he fears, will only lead to more resistance, as they have in the past. What’s needed is messaging linking Covid-19 vaccination to being a good parent, because right now, many people believe good parenting means protecting your child against vaccines.

Beyond PR campaigns, there are other ways schools and districts can motivate families to vaccinate children. Some have used incentives, like money, gift cards, or free tickets to prom. Many — about two-thirds of the districts CRPE studies — offer vaccine clinics on campus to make it easy for students to get the shot.

It’s also important for clinicians and public health officials to be able to talk with families about the vaccine. Parents’ view on vaccines often depends on “if they have access to information or reliable experts that can help address questions,” Kalu said.

Overall, experts emphasize the importance of normalizing the Covid-19 vaccine as just another part of the childhood immunization process. “People that do not have young kids, or do not remember being a young child, may forget how often vaccines are a part of normal preventive care for children,” Kalu said. “Approaching it from that perspective, somewhat removed from the chaos of Covid itself, might be helpful.”

At the same time, even what many people now accept as normal childhood immunizations have been the subject of controversy and resistance for centuries. Public health officials and school districts may have a long road ahead of them — but if it’s any consolation, it’s one many have traveled before.",voxdotcom,"['public', 'school', 'require', 'covid19', 'health', 'schools', 'vaccine', 'vaccination', 'mandates', 'districts', 'students', 'children', 'vaccines']",0

2022-02-09 13:00:53+00:00,11,"At the start of the pandemic, recovery from a coronavirus infection was perhaps a reason for cautious optimism: If you were lucky enough to bounce back from Covid-19, you had some level of immunity. Over time, research bore this out, though it also showed that immunity wanes, so recovering from the virus wasn’t a one-and-done deal. So how should vaccinated people think about their immunity after they’ve recovered from a breakthrough infection?

After an omicron surge that infected hundreds of thousands of people a day in the US — including many people who had breakthrough cases — some are wondering if the combination of vaccination and infection, known as hybrid immunity, will offer some kind of lasting protection. Is this brush with the virus enough to warrant relief and a resumption of life sans pandemic precautions? Vox spoke with experts to help advise the newly recovered.

What does a Covid-19 infection do for my immunity?

Immunity is defined as your body’s ability to protect you from getting sick when you’re exposed to bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi; immunity can help protect you from getting infected in the first place, and if you do get infected, it can prevent you from feeling ill or protect you from severe symptoms. Depending on the type of infection, this kind of protection can last for months, years, or even a lifetime. For instance, once people recover from measles, they’re immune for life and won’t catch it again. But most illnesses aren’t one and done. Immunity to Covid-19 can last for months, but it gets weaker over time and the exact duration is still being studied.

Everyone’s body and immune system react differently to the viruses they encounter. Unlike vaccines, which deliver a standard size and formula to large populations, “having a Covid infection is a very unstandardized thing,” says Theodore Bailey, the chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. (Even though everyone’s immune system reacts differently to the same vaccine dose — someone could have serious side effects and others could have none — the shots themselves are standardized.)

If you tested positive for Covid-19, it’s difficult to know how much virus you were exposed to, how much it managed to reproduce in your body, and how engaged your immune system became to fight it off. So it’s hard to know how protected you will be, too. “One person’s infection is not someone else’s infection,” Bailey says.

Studies show that before omicron came along, recovery from Covid-19 infections made people a lot less likely to get infected again — at least for many months. But omicron seemed to behave differently: A non-peer-reviewed study conducted during England’s omicron wave found that omicron has the potential to evade immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses. Similarly, another non-peer-reviewed Danish study found that omicron was able to evade immune responses in vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike (though a small South African study showed an omicron infection may protect against delta, which now comprises a small minority of cases in the US).

For vaccinated people who do get sick, breakthrough infections provide a boost in immunity, according to research from December. “People who have had both the illness and vaccination have much higher levels of antibodies than those people who just have recovered and have not been vaccinated,” says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “And higher levels of antibody are associated with a longer duration of protection.” If you’ve recently recovered from Covid-19 and are unvaccinated, Schaffner advises getting the shot to capitalize on this protective combination.

Is it safe to go to restaurants and bars after a Covid-19 infection?

You’re extremely unlikely to be reinfected with the same variant within a month or two of recovering from Covid-19, Bailey says. One scientific review of published research on Covid-19 immunity suggested that antibody levels begin to decline three months after a previous infection. However, when you gain immunity to one variant, you don’t necessarily gain immunity to others: It is possible to be swiftly reinfected with omicron after you recover from delta. So a breakthrough infection isn’t permission to live it up like it’s 2019.

Because there will always be a risk of reinfection, Bailey suggests thinking about immunity in the weeks following recovery as a little like airbags in a car. Airbags protect drivers from serious injury, but risky behaviors like texting, speeding, or careless driving offset the benefits of the airbag. Something similar is true of post-infection immunity: Antibodies provide protection, but persistent high-risk activities — like going unmasked in a crowded bar — increase risk of reinfection.

That’s not to say recently recovered people don’t have any wiggle room. They just have to decide how much risk they’re willing to tolerate. In the initial months post-infection, most healthy vaccinated people who are not immunocompromised have a low risk of severe reinfection, Bailey says, meaning they can move about the world knowing a visit to the gym won’t kill them.

“They do have a level of risk that’s similar to other things that we tolerate,” like driving on the highway, Bailey says. “Therefore, doing things like going out to a restaurant, potentially traveling, becomes something that is safer, and is safer still if you wear masks as much as you can and you’re not going to really super high-density things like a rave or a mosh pit. Those things will still push your risk back up again.”

What other fun stuff can I do safely now, and what precautions are necessary?

If you’re thinking of getting on a plane or attending an indoor sporting event, Bailey says to ensure you’re still taking precautions, like masking and avoiding crowds as best you can. “Even though I have my airbag, I’m still going to put my seatbelt on, I’m still going to pay attention to the traffic,” he says. “As I take that extra level of risk, I’m thinking about what else I can do in my immediate environment that limits unnecessary elevation of risk.”

Schaffner agrees that recently recovered folks should still be wary of crowds and should continue to mask up indoors. “It’s not recommended that they be carefree and say, ‘Okay, I’ve gotten a get out of jail free card, I can do whatever I want,’” he says. Should you decide on a post-illness vacation, ensure you’re still testing and masking, especially if you are visiting with an elderly grandparent or immunocompromised friend during or after your trip, Schaffner advises.

While Schaffner says it’s unlikely in the short term that you’ll get an infection and spread it, it’s still possible. The more time that passes following your recovery, the more likely it is that you could get reinfected and spread the virus. The CDC continues to recommend that anyone who tests positive go into isolation, even if they’re asymptomatic.

The risk of future variants should make people a little more careful about post-infection behavior, Schaffner says. When a new variant emerges, the world may face another round of wait-and-see uncertainty to determine how well vaccination, protection from prior infection, and hybrid immunity hold up against the mutated virus.

Ultimately, what activities you decide to partake in after recovering from Covid-19, Schaffner says, comes down to how much risk you’re willing to withstand. “If you’re 72 years old with diabetes, everything is at risk. That’s what I would tell all my patients,” he says. “If you’re 28 years old and otherwise completely healthy and you’ve recovered, the first thing I would ask you is, ‘Are you vaccinated?’ Those folks can go out.” But because nothing is “safe” or comes without risk, he recommends everyone masks in indoor environments.

As cases subside, the overall risk will, too: Less virus in the community means less chance of catching it and spreading it. On top of that, you can probably breathe a tentative sigh of relief for a few weeks post-infection, as long as you continue to avoid unnecessary risks, like crowded dance floors, and mask up around vulnerable loved ones and anyone outside your household.",voxdotcom,"['youre', 'vaccinated', 'im', 'relax', 'risk', 'covid19', 'boosted', 'recovered', 'immunity', 'infection', 'omicron', 'vaxxed', 'bailey', 'schaffner']",0

2022-02-03 20:21:17+00:00,1,"Franco, a 28-year-old Brazilian, agonized over getting the Covid-19 vaccine up until the moment the shot went into his arm. “I was skeptical in line,” he said. “Like, playing chicken, you know? Am I going to take it or not? It’s my turn.”

He went through with it; once, then twice, for his Pfizer doses. “I have decided to get vaccinated after having a sit-down with my physician, and we did our checks and balances regarding my health issues,” Franco said. (Vox is withholding his last name to protect his privacy.)

Franco also decided to get vaccinated in case of possible mandates for air travel, which have not happened. But one thing did not really factor into his decision: politics.

Franco is a supporter of President Jair Bolsonaro — he’s been with Bolsonaro “all the time.” And Bolsonaro just happens to be the most prominent vaccine skeptic in Brazil.

Bolsonaro’s skepticism might sound familiar, but in Brazil, vaccination has not become an ideological or political issue the way it has in the United States. More than 70 percent of Brazilians have been fully vaccinated, surpassing places like the US, which started its campaign much earlier.

Bolsonaro himself has said he is not vaccinated, and he has challenged Covid-19 measures from the start, even as Brazil dealt with devastating waves. Bolsonaro has dismissed the severity of the virus, touted unproven cures, and battled lockdown measures. He raised doubts about vaccines, claiming they could increase the chance of contracting AIDS (they cannot). His administration tried to undermine the approval of vaccines for kids. Broadly, Bolsonaro has tied vaccination to the idea of freedom. “If a citizen does not want to get the vaccine, it is his right and that’s it,” he said in October.

Brazil’s health regulatory agency (Anvisa), the World Health Organization, and health agencies around the world have concluded that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe disease outcomes, like hospitalization and death.

Franco said he doesn’t see Bolsonaro as attacking vaccines; he thought some of the president’s phrasing was unfortunate, or taken out of context by the media or political opponents. Instead, he thinks Bolsonaro wanted more testing — that the president was just saying, wait a second. “Everybody is looking at what Bolsonaro used to say back in the day, and realizing that he was just raising up the question: Is that a safe thing? Is it going to make everybody well enough to go back to work?”

There are plenty of others who see things differently. They point to Bolsonaro promoting vaccine misinformation and taking steps to undermine inoculation efforts, and doing so from the most powerful seat in government, in a manner that impeded Brazil’s Covid-19 response.

Yet, some places, like the city of São Paulo, say they have fully vaccinated the entire eligible population. About 90 percent of adults say they will get the shot.

Public health experts credit the trust in Brazil’s primary health care system and national immunization programs. The country has conducted mass vaccination campaigns in recent memory, including for diseases like polio, which was eradicated there in 1989.

“Despite this anti-vax approach that Bolsonaro took on, we had some benefits from our culture of vaccination,” said Wasim Aluísio Prates-Syed, of União Pró-Vacina, a pro-vaccination union.

Raphael Augusto Teixeira de Aguiar, a professor in the preventive and social medicine department at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, added that Brazil has “built up the system for so many years. It’s not easy to destroy it.”

That has muted, if not entirely eliminated, the influence of anti-vaccine sentiment and misinformation. But although Brazilians’ trust in the country’s public health and vaccination programs may have survived Covid-19 and the president’s efforts to unravel them, Brazil has not emerged unscathed. “Today we don’t have to worry. Covid will not be a problem. But I’m worried about the future,” said Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a microbiologist and president of the Instituto Questão de Ciência.

How Brazil has overcome Bolsonaro on Covid-19

On January 14, Brazil started vaccinating kids, ages 5 to 11 — almost a full month after Brazil’s federal health regulatory agency, Anvisa, approved the vaccines for that age group. Bolsonaro and his administration spent that month trying to stymie any vaccination efforts.

“Kids are something very serious,” Bolsonaro said after Anvisa’s approval. “We don’t know about possible adverse future effects. It’s unbelievable — I’m sorry — what the agency did. Unbelievable.” He also threatened to release the names of the regulators who had made the decision. (Studies show that side effects are rare.)

Bolsonaro and his administration tried to push a policy to require a doctor’s prescription for childhood vaccination, a process that would have slowed the inoculation campaign. Bolsonaro’s government launched an online survey and tried to get its supporters to flood the results. The questions were also confusingly worded and, some critics said, phrased that way to get the outcome the government desired.

That gambit failed. Of the tens of thousands who participated in the survey, the majority opposed prescriptions for childhood vaccines, and supported a much simpler process. The Ministry of Health finally put a campaign in place to vaccinate kids.

Lorena Chaves, a researcher at Emory University, said this showed Brazil’s success at fighting vaccine misinformation, with doctors and health institutions rejecting anti-vaccine efforts. Throughout the Brazil’s vaccination campaign, groups like Prates-Syed’s pro-vaccine union worked alongside others, like Rotary International’s #INFORMAÇÃOSALVAVIDAS (Information Saves Lives) campaign, to debunk misinformation.

But in general, experts said, Brazil doesn’t have a powerful anti-vaccine movement.

“Brazil is really unique when it comes to vaccination history and vaccination tradition,” Pasternak said. “And that puts us in a very privileged position, because it’s been 50 years of an excellent vaccination program. And during this 50 years, vaccine confidence was built in the Brazilian population.”

“So residents are very favorable to vaccination, and that, it makes them kind of immune to vaccine misinformation,” she added.

In the 1980s, Brazil conducted a massive campaign to eradicate polio, vaccinating more than 10 million people in one day. There is even a vaccination mascot, Zé Gotinha. Brazil has also conducted large-scale efforts for measles and for yellow fever. There is a living memory of life before, and after, vaccines. “A whole generation really grew up with this tradition of being vaccinated,” Aguiar said.

“I think most fathers and mothers and grandparents, they can remember how awful the situation was before the vaccines,” he added.

Aguiar said underlying this is Brazil’s primary health care system, with clinics throughout the country and other community-based programs. Together with vaccination, this health care infrastructure helped dramatically improve Brazil’s health outcomes for things like the child mortality rate and life expectancy. And Brazil has experience fighting epidemics of tropical diseases like dengue and Zika.

For these reasons, Brazilians largely still have faith that their health institutions are working. This is especially true for technical agencies — like Anvisa, which approves the vaccines. These agencies were somewhat insulated from the politicization of Covid-19 that permeated other parts of Bolsonaro’s government, like the Ministry of Health.

“We, all the Brazilians, truly trust it,” said Renata Vasconcelos, who, along with her husband, Henrique Vasconcelos, works with Rotary International to combat Covid-19 vaccine misinformation. Renata said that if regulators say more shots are recommended, “we are going to respect that and have it.”

Beyond trust in the system, Brazilians witnessed Covid-19’s devastation for themselves. More than 625,000 Brazilians died from Covid-19, the world’s second highest death count behind the United States. That toll was extraordinary, and the population wanted a way to avoid deadly wave after deadly wave. “Everybody has someone that we lost,” Henrique Vasconcelos said.

Maurício Terra Dias, a 59-year-old from Goiânia who voted for Bolsonaro in 2018 — but who says he will not vote for him again — put it another way in an email: “People [were] too scared to follow that insanity.”

Brazil’s health system was resilient — this time

By many metrics, Brazil bungled its Covid-19 response. A Brazilian Senate panel has alleged Bolsonaro’s response to the pandemic is more than negligence. Instead, they argue, it was deliberate mismanagement to try to achieve herd immunity with a large amount of Covid-19 cases, something lawmakers suggested could amount to crimes against humanity.

Bolsonaro’s government also mishandled the vaccination campaign. The administration was late to secure doses, and reportedly ignored overtures by Pfizer to buy doses. Other efforts were tainted by allegations of corruption, with officials trying to get kickbacks from suppliers. All of that undermined Brazil’s vaccination program, delaying the start of the rollout until mid-January 2021, and leaving the country short on supply.

But the campaign picked up in the middle of last year, hitting rates just about on par with many European countries. This is largely because the system proved, despite chaotic leadership from the federal government, to be resilient. Doctors, social movements, state governors, and local officials mobilized, reacting, improvising, and adjusting.

“A lot of people think Brazil’s Covid-19 response was a disaster,” said João Nunes, a senior lecturer in international relations at York University. “But it wasn’t a disaster. It would have been a lot worse if it weren’t for this resilience, for this capacity of the public health system.”

Bolsonaro has always maintained his unshakable base of supporters, but, increasingly, that’s all who’s left. His government is more unpopular than ever, and Bolsonaro is trailing far behind his likely opponent in the 2022 election. The country is facing an economic crisis, and as Aguiar said, people who are struggling to survive can’t afford to be sick. Many see Bolsonaro’s anti-vaccine crusade as a way to distract from his own failures on Covid-19, and the economy, and turn it into a fight over ideology, in an attempt to galvanize his supporters. “Now we are almost all tired of his idiocy,” Terra Dias said.

All of this helped create a buffer against Bolsonaro, but experts said it is fragile and not guaranteed to be permanent. “When it comes to vaccines, we have this 50-year-old tradition of trust,” Pasternak added. “And trust is not the same as understanding. It’s not the same as scientific literacy.”

The health system’s resiliency could still falter. Indeed, the rollout of childhood vaccinations for kids under 11 has been pretty slow so far, and some officials have blamed Bolsonaro for this, including his comments that he would not vaccinate his 11-year-old daughter.

“It’s the first time in Brazil in history that we have an outright anti-vax spreading vaccine misinformation,” Pasternak said. “So this beautiful vaccine confidence that we have today — that makes us immune even to Bolsonaro’s claims that vaccines are going to give you AIDS, turn you into an alligator, or kill children — I don’t know where we’ll be in like five years’ time, if these attacks continue.”

Franco is supportive of vaccines, but thought the Covid-19 doses were misleadingly sold as the silver-bullet cure to Covid-19. He believes that even more strongly after his vaccinated father spent eight days in the ICU with Covid-19. He is still evaluating whether he’ll get a booster shot; he’ll talk to his doctor again, get a checkup. He’s unsure if he’s better off vaccinated — maybe, maybe not — but he does not regret it, either.

2022-02-03 18:30:08+00:00,7,"Before the omicron wave ripped through the country, infecting even those with multiple doses of the Covid-19 vaccines, evidence was already emerging that the effectiveness of vaccines to protect against infection started to wane after several months. Booster shots were soon approved in response, to recharge people’s immunity against a virus that is still widespread.

By now, for some Americans, it’s been months since those booster shots. Israel, which has taken one of the most aggressive approaches to vaccination, is considering fourth doses for all adults. So that raises the question for boosted Americans: Am I going to need a fourth shot?

For now, experts say, it depends. If you are immunocompromised, yes, you should get a fourth shot — and you’re already eligible. For everyone else, the jury is still out, although a fourth shot doesn’t appear to be immediately on the horizon.

Experts say that because immunocompromised people are more vulnerable right now, it makes sense for them to get another dose of the vaccines currently available. For everybody else, scientists are still assessing whether another dose is actually necessary, as well as what kind of dose it should be.

Immunocompromised people already qualify for four doses under the CDC’s recommendations. Eligible patients include people who are receiving cancer treatment, people who have received an organ transplant, people with HIV infections, and people who have autoimmune disorders or who are taking medications that can suppress their immune system.

Immunocompromised people did not receive the same level of protection from the initial two-dose regimen of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which is why they were one of the first groups made eligible for booster shots last fall. For them, three doses effectively serve as their first vaccine course, with a booster to be given several months after that.

Preliminary studies out of the UK, US, and France have indicated that about half of the immunocompromised people who did not see any immune response after two doses did experience a response after the third dose, and more robust research is underway to assess the effectiveness of a fourth shot, particularly for immunocompromised people.

There have been reports of people who meet those criteria being turned away at pharmacies, another example of poor communication in the US pandemic response. But the Biden White House held a call with pharmacists last week to more clearly lay out who is eligible for an additional shot and ensure those people are not denied the opportunity to bolster their immune system’s response to Covid-19.

So immunocompromised people are the priority for fourth shots right now. For everybody else, experts say we’ll need to wait and see.

One Israeli study found a strong antibody response after four doses of the original vaccine, though it wasn’t sufficient to fully prevent infection from the omicron variant. Israel, one of the most aggressive countries on booster shots, has made all adults over 60 years old, health care workers, and nursing home residents eligible for a fourth shot. It is considering fourth shots for all adults over 18, after at least five months has passed since their third dose or a Covid-19 infection.

For the time being, the half-dozen experts I asked about fourth shots were unanimous that an additional dose makes sense for the immunocompromised, but they also agree the evidence is not yet persuasive for the wider population, at least until some of the studies being conducted on fourth shots and on omicron-specific vaccines are completed.

Pfizer and Moderna are focusing on omicron-specific doses; Pfizer has said that vaccine could be available as soon as March, and Moderna also expects results from its clinical trials next month.

“I’m not persuaded that fourth shots are necessary. We’ll have to see when the actual data comes out,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, told me. “With, as you point out, the exception being immunocompromised people.”

The next shot that many people receive may be more targeted to the latest variant. Some scientists even argue we need vaccines that combine the old and the new formulations, in case the next variant after omicron has genetically more in common with earlier strains.

The underlying point is, the original version of the vaccines may be in need of an update. But the data is still coming in on how urgent those additional shots are for most people.

And be aware: The thinking could change in the coming months. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease researcher at the University of California San Francisco, told me that she thought people over 75 with multiple chronic conditions might benefit from another dose. William Hanage, a Harvard epidemiologist, said that if a fourth shot were shown to prevent any infection, even for a short time, it might make sense to again inoculate medical workers during future surges to prevent hospitals from becoming understaffed.

The science is always changing. And we could be moving into a future where periodic Covid-19 boosters are a part of the usual vaccine schedule, like annual flu shots. Moderna’s chief medical officer told CNBC this week that he thought omicron-specific vaccines could fill that role going forward.

As Peter Hotez, who leads the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, told me: “We need clarity on the durability of mRNA vaccines.”

But what should not be lost in this debate is that the vaccines we do have, and the doses already administered, are doing a lot of good. People with three doses had a 96 percent reduced risk of hospitalization from omicron, according to a recent CDC study; even people with only two doses saw an 81 percent reduced risk. Though immune responses vary by age and health, the vast majority of elderly people still showed an immune response five months after their third shot.

A projection from the Commonwealth Fund estimated the Covid-19 vaccines had saved as many as 1.1 million lives through November 2021. So while the situation is always changing, as omicron reminded us, the basic value of vaccination has not. Some of us might need an additional shot right now. The rest of us might need one later.

But the takeaway remains the same: Get your shots as recommended. They save lives.",voxdotcom,"['actually', 'dose', 'response', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'fourth', 'needs', 'shots', 'doses', 'need', 'shot', 'immunocompromised', 'vaccines']",0
2022-02-03 17:10:06+00:00,3,"Children under 5 years old, who make up one of the largest unvaccinated groups in the US, could soon become eligible to receive Covid-19 shots. The US Food and Drug Administration will consider whether to authorize two small doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines for these children on an emergency basis, the companies announced this week.

Approval could come as soon as this month. But Pfizer and the FDA have a tricky needle to thread, moving quickly while trying to maintain public trust in the process.

Vaccines for young children would help constrain the spread of the virus, relieve stress on hospitals, and help schools stay open. They would also provide peace of mind to parents, caregivers, and teachers whose lives have been repeatedly disrupted as the highly transmissible omicron variant continues to rage. More than 20 million children in the United States fall into this age group, so an emergency use authorization (EUA) would close one of the biggest remaining gaps in vaccine eligibility.

But Pfizer’s own data showed that its vaccine generated less robust protection in some very young children with the first two doses. The company is still studying the impact of a third shot administered at least eight weeks later. Filing for approval at this stage is unusual, but company officials say they aim to give parents the option of starting to vaccinate kids sooner. That way they’re ready to receive a third dose by the time it’s greenlit.

“Ultimately, we believe that three doses of the vaccine will be needed for children 6 months through 4 years of age to achieve high levels of protection against current and potential future variants,” said Albert Bourla, chair and CEO of Pfizer, in a press release. “If two doses are authorized, parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID-19 vaccination series for their children while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose.”

It’s a different process than what’s been used for vaccines in other age groups. Some doctors are concerned that if public health officials fumble the approval process and messaging, it could create more confusion and hesitancy around vaccines.

Health officials are already trying to reassure the public that regulators will not relax their standards. “This is the same rigorous process that was used to assess numerous vaccines long before the pandemic began,” said US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy at a press conference this week.

The Pfizer/BioNTech announcement comes at a time when new Covid-19 infections driven by the omicron variant are declining across the United States, but children are forming a larger share of infections and hospitalizations. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 10.6 million US children have tested positive for the virus. Children under 4 have accounted for 1.6 million of those cases, leading to 287 deaths in that age group as of January 29.

However, parents have shown so far that they are not as motivated to vaccinate kids — only about one-third of parents say they’ve started vaccinating their 5- to 11-year-olds, according to one poll — and physicians worry that Pfizer and BioNTech’s unusual vaccine approval application could deter them further. While closing gaps in eligibility is a key step toward more widespread immunity, this round of shots can only help bring the pandemic under control if people take them.

Why Pfizer/BioNTech’s latest application to the FDA is different

The FDA approval process usually aims to ensure that vaccines perform similarly across all ages. Since some very young children showed a weaker immune response than adults after two doses of their Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer and BioNTech added a third dose to their study and expected to file for approval pending those results.

But the towering winter peak of Covid-19 cases may have spurred regulators themselves to get the ball rolling sooner, with the expectation that data would soon show that three Pfizer/BioNTech doses provide immune protection in kids that matches that in adults.

“Frankly, everybody in my field was a little surprised,” said Kristin Moffitt, an infectious disease physician at Boston Children’s Hospital. “It sounds like the FDA did outreach to Pfizer, likely driven by how much omicron transmission we’re seeing and the unbelievable impacts on all age groups.”

In clinical trials of more than 8,000 children between 6 months old and 12 years old, researchers saw that different age groups had varying immune responses, suggesting that not all were equally protected against the coronavirus. Children between 6 months and 2 years old showed stronger responses, Pfizer noted in December, comparable to the levels seen in 16- to 25-year-olds. But the response was weaker in 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds.

Why the youngest children had a stronger immune response than older kids is a mystery. “I don’t know how that happens, but it happens,” said Janet Englund, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children’s Hospital, who is helping administer the Pfizer study. “If you would’ve asked me would I have predicted that, I would have said ‘no.’”

Researchers are now investigating whether a third dose in young children would bolster the immune response. The results may be ready in March, at which point regulators will begin the review process again.

Why did it take so long to get here? One reason is the nature of Covid-19 itself, a disease that exacted its dearest toll from older adults while children faced a much lower rate of hospitalization and death. That made vaccine approval for adults a higher priority than for younger children.

Moving down in age groups also takes time. There’s an adage in medical research that children are not little adults. Their bodies respond in different ways to drugs, and researchers can’t just assume the same protocol will work as well or be just as safe across all ages. So clinical trials are conducted in stages by age groups, doses are tweaked, and the youngest children are almost always the last to be tested.

“Vaccine doses have historically been age-dependent,” Moffitt said. “It really has to do with the maturity of the immune system.”

For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the adult dose is 30 micrograms, children between 5 and 11 receive 10 micrograms, and children under 5 receive 3 micrograms.

Conducting research in younger age groups has additional complications. Children are much more finicky test subjects than adults. “As a pediatrician, I can tell you it’s incredibly difficult,” Englund said. Not only do children have to receive their shots spaced weeks apart, but in a clinical trial, they also have to show up for blood tests and follow-up exams. Attrition rates in clinical trials of kids can be high.

It gets even trickier to study children under 5 years old and keep track of their complications or concerns. “Five- to 11-year-olds can talk and complain,“ Englund said. “Doing this in kids less than 5 is more work.” So it’s that much harder to collect the amount and quality of data needed to satisfy the FDA.

Children are at lower risk, but they’re getting infected in large numbers

Thankfully, children have generally faced much lower rates of severe illness and death from Covid-19 compared to adults. But the rates are not zero, and with the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant, more children are being hospitalized.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children accounted for almost 23 percent of new Covid-19 cases by the end of January. More than 17 percent of all Covid-19 cases in children under 18 occurred in the last two weeks of January. Across the US, children made up between 1.6 percent and 4.4 percent of hospitalizations.

“The sheer number of cases of omicron has been associated with more pediatric hospitalizations than we have seen at any other time during this pandemic,” Moffitt said. “We were absolutely feeling this, and families were feeling this. A lot of these were otherwise healthy kids.”

Even if children don’t get severely ill, pediatric Covid-19 cases have ripple effects: They can shut down schools, disrupt learning, and require parents to take time off work to care for sick children. Infected kids can also transmit the disease.

Still, caregivers of children don’t seem to be racing to vaccinate kids. In November 2021, an emergency use authorization made 28 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 eligible to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. But the uptake has been slow.

“In my community, we’ve been a little disappointed with the uptake,” Englund said. “In our 5- to 12-year-olds, we’re barely at 50 percent, despite the fact the vaccine is widely available at schools and vaccine clinics.”

The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that as of February 1, about 33 percent of US parents of 5- to 11-year-olds say their kids have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Only 30 percent of parents of kids under age 5 say they will vaccinate their kids as soon as possible.

Moffit said she’s encountered parents of very young children who are eager to have their kids vaccinated, and others who are hesitant and want to wait a while. Some want to wait for the vaccine to “graduate” from an EUA to full FDA approval, which could take months.

If the FDA approves two pediatric doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, with the expectation that young children won’t get full protection until a third dose is approved down the road, health officials will have to be proactive about explaining this clearly to the public. Otherwise, the process could sow confusion and fuel hesitancy.

“I do worry if that approach ends up being taken, it may make it an even harder sell for vaccine uptake,” she said. “I think the FDA is going to have a tough call here.”

Researchers are also studying the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in babies as young as 2 months old. “We do see kids under 6 months hospitalized at our hospital,” Englund said. Scientists are also studying immunity in vaccinated pregnant people and their babies, to see how much immunity carries over to newborns. Whether babies under 6 months old will need Covid-19 shots will also depend on what variants are in circulation and the rate of transmission of the virus.

The FDA’s upcoming decision won’t be the last word on Covid-19 shots for young children. In time, doctors are hoping to see more Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in children. “I think we need to have multiple vaccines available. ... I’d like to have three or four,” Englund said. “Maybe another vaccine might work better, or have less side effects, or be cheaper, or be more available in some places.”",voxdotcom,"['pfizerbiontech', 'kids', 'covid19', 'long', 'vaccine', 'doses', 'waited', 'age', 'pfizer', 'young', 'parents', 'children', 'vaccines']",0
2022-01-31 12:02:01+00:00,5,"The omicron variant of Covid-19 was discovered less than three months ago, but it rocketed case numbers to record highs. Yet almost as rapidly as they rose, new infections plummeted in countries like the United Kingdom, South Africa, and now the United States.

Omicron caused some of the pandemic’s tallest, sharpest spikes in Covid-19 infections as it overtook previous variants like delta, but several waves triggered by earlier variants followed a remarkably similar pattern. Almost as steeply as cases rose, they fell.

Why did this happen? Why didn’t omicron cases rise and fall slowly — or level out at a high or moderate level?

“I think you may get different answers from different experts,” said Eleanor Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University, in an email. This isn’t just a curiosity: Researchers are trying to tease out the reasons in the hope of flattening peaks in the future.

Understanding why cases are rising and falling is crucial for figuring out what kinds of public health strategies are working. It’s also important for anticipating what comes next and how to deploy resources like medical workers, hospital beds, vaccines, and treatments.

The Covid-19 spikes we’re seeing are not just an intrinsic fact of nature. They’re partly a consequence of how we respond — or don’t — to changes in the virus and in our society. And as steep spikes are eventually replaced by shallower slopes, they will also reveal when the acute Covid-19 pandemic has ebbed and given way to an endemic disease.

Why omicron shot up — and down — so fast

The omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, appeared at just the right time to cause a huge infection spike. It took root in the Northern Hemisphere as holiday travel picked up and cooler temperatures pushed people indoors, helping it travel long distances and spread locally through person-to-person contact.

Omicron also had the right mix of traits to catch fire. The omicron variant contains mutations that allow it to better evade immune protection while spreading faster than any prior known variant. Even people vaccinated against Covid-19 began getting infected in large numbers as protection from their initial doses started to waver, though most experienced mild symptoms. All these factors together led to lots of infections happening very quickly.

“It has infected everybody that could be infected out and about — and that means automatically it will run out of people to infect and start coming down as fast as it went up,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

While omicron has been the most extreme example of this phenomenon, earlier variants also caused sharp spikes and declines. South Africa, for instance, saw distinct peaks associated with different variants. Most of these peculiar “stalagmites” in South Africa were symmetrical except for the delta wave last summer, which saw a brief resurgence on its way down.

“[T]he shape of a spike then decline is what we generally expect in a single population,” said Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health, in an email.

A key variable is the basic reproductive number of the virus, or R 0 , which is the average number of people that one infected individual tends to infect. “If that number is above one, the epidemic grows exponentially; if it is below one, it declines exponentially,” Lessler said.

As more people get infected with a coronavirus variant, there are fewer people left to infect. When the basic reproductive number falls below one, new infections reach their peak and then decline. To plateau, the rate of new infections has to stabilize somewhere near one, but that would require an unusual set of conditions, according to Lessler.

The idea that disease outbreaks are generally symmetrical is an old one. William Farr observed in the 1840s that smallpox epidemics followed a mathematical pattern, though his formula, known as Farr’s law, resulted in a bell-shaped curve. But diseases rarely follow such neat curves.

“That has been generally discredited as a ‘law’ since it doesn’t allow for things like changes in susceptibility due to different levels of immunity/immune waning, movement in and out of populations, and changes to risk and exposure behaviors,” said Murray.

That’s been evident during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some countries like South Korea saw more gentle hills as different variants took root, while others like Brazil experienced asymmetrical, jagged peaks throughout the pandemic. Some of that is due to delays in identifying and reporting cases. In some places, variants like delta and omicron overlapped. At the country level, case curves can change shape as the pandemic spreads over time from urban to rural areas or can peak at different times depending on the region.

Then one has to account for public health interventions. Vaccines offer significant immune protection (and recovery from Covid-19 can be protective too). Measures like wearing face masks, limiting public gatherings, more rigorous testing, and boosting vaccination efforts also assist in “flattening the curve” and help waves to crest. People also change their behavior in response to rising infections. In the US, surges in vaccination and testing followed spikes in cases.

“That increase in testing and implementation of public health interventions helps us not only reduce transmission, but also more accurately and timely identify dips in cases,” said Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, in an email. “These are also good examples of how effective the vaccines have been and our ability to rapidly respond to spikes and novel variants.”

So both the shape and the size of an infection spike can be altered with public health tactics. Over time, as immunity builds up in the population, experts expect to stop seeing tall, sharp spikes in Covid-19 cases. The virus probably won’t go away entirely, but case counts could form seasonal waves as new variants arise, immunity wanes, and exposure opportunities increase, according to Mokdad.

Omicron cases are poised to drop further, but only if we remain vigilant

Covid-19 cases spurred by omicron appear to have peaked already in the US, but the health care system is still facing a stressful time ahead.

When an outbreak peaks in a given community, “50 percent of the infections have occurred and now another 50 will happen as we come down,” Mokdad said. “So we still have a couple of weeks ahead of us that are dangerous in the United States. ... A small fraction of them are going to the hospitals, but a small fraction of a huge number is a lot.”

If public health measures like masking and social distancing are relaxed too soon, cases can bounce back up on their way down. The UK, for instance, reopened schools and relaxed Covid-19 rules before the omicron wave flattened out. Then infections stopped dropping.

The same thing could happen to other countries. “That sharp decline will slow down at one point, then it goes back [down] sharply again,” Mokdad said. “That’s what we are noticing globally.”

Even after the omicron wave recedes, the US will still have to contend with people who remain unvaccinated against Covid-19, both inside the country and around the world. And the virus is always changing: Omicron now has a subvariant called BA.2 that is gaining some ground, though it’s not yet clear what it means for the pandemic overall.

The more the virus spreads, the more likely it is to mutate in dangerous ways. As the current variants have shown, they can quickly spread around the world, regardless of where they originate.

The recurring spikes of Covid-19 cases, fueled in part by variants, should inspire us to redouble our efforts at controlling the disease, especially with vaccines. “We’re still struggling to avoid these peaks as vigilant infection prevention efforts and global vaccine equity have been a challenge,” said Popescu.

A more robust global vaccination effort, coupled with better disease surveillance to catch variants before they spell trouble, could prevent the next wave and finally start to bring the pandemic under control.",voxdotcom,"['spikes', 'surge', 'fall', 'public', 'infections', 'virus', 'covid19', 'health', 'spike', 'pandemic', 'omicron', 'variants', 'rapidly', 'cases', 'sharply']",0
2022-01-29 12:00:34+00:00,9,"The staffing crisis in health care reached a farcical extreme last week when ThedaCare, a health system in Wisconsin, filed for a temporary restraining order to block a number of its employees from leaving their jobs and moving to another nearby hospital.

The hospital argued that, because the pandemic had created a shortage of health care workers, it needed the court to block the employees from leaving at least until it was able to come up with a staffing plan.

As medical workers burn out, isolate due to Covid-19, and leave for other professions, the ensuing staffing shortage has gotten so severe that ThedaCare turned to the courts to try to fix it. It was a striking example of how the pandemic has turned the health care labor market upside down, putting nurses and doctors in higher demand than ever even as they must face the most grueling working conditions of their careers.

The workers and the hospital that hired them, Ascension Northeast Wisconsin, countered that ThedaCare could have matched the offers made by Ascension, but didn’t. By declining to match and then failing to come up with a plan before the workers were to set to leave, they argued ThedaCare was attempting to punish the workers for its own shortsightedness.

It appeared for a moment that ThedaCare’s gambit might work: A local judge granted the temporary injunction. But the judge changed course a few days and lifted the order, allowing the workers — members of an interventional radiology and cardiovascular team — to start work at their new employer.

It was all bizarre. I talked to several health care economists and none of them could remember a situation in which one hospital had sued another to prevent their employees from leaving. It runs counter to the way the US has set up its health care system, which largely treats medical workers as free agents, able to pick where they will work at will. If anything, before the pandemic, the opposite happened: Nurses had sued hospitals, arguing that they were colluding to depress wages.

But the pandemic has changed the dynamic. The demand for health care services has grown dramatically but the supply of labor is relatively stagnant. That has allowed health care workers to command better salaries, with many moving to traveling nurse agencies that place workers in high-demand areas for salaries much higher than they would normally make in standard full-time employment.

“What we have seen is a very rapid shift in the balance of power in hospital labor markets,” Hannah Neprash, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, told me. “This is a pretty extreme example of a health system acting out a bit in the face of this totally shaken-up labor market.”

Why the pandemic has turned the medical labor market upside down

On its face, there was nothing unusual about Ascension hiring seven members of ThedaCare’s interventional radiology and cardiovascular team. According to the workers, it was not even a case of poaching; one employee saw the job listing, applied and received an offer, and other members followed suit because the pay and benefits were better.

But even if they had been poached — hired all at once away from their prior employer — that is just how the game is played. Health systems will sometimes recruit entire teams because they have built a rapport with one another that is essential to good medicine. Hospitals will often market themselves as having good teams in a specific area of treatment — stroke care, for example — and they justify the claims based on the amount of experience the workers have together.

“That’s not new behavior in any way at all,” Joanne Spetz, a health economist at the University of California San Francisco, told me. “The poaching and recruitment of full teams happened pre-pandemic.”

But in the last two years, when Covid-19 cases soared, so did the demand for medical workers. In some areas, the number of jobs for certain specialties, such as ICU nurses, increased by more than 300 percent early in the pandemic, according to one study on the health care labor market during Covid-19.

Even with demand soaring, the supply of health care workers couldn’t keep up. In fact, there was some downward pressure on supply. Many medical workers left the profession in the pandemic, burned out by the most difficult working conditions of their lives. There were also new restrictions on medical workers migrating into the United States during the public health emergency, cutting off another source of new workers to meet the demand.

As a result, the market had to compensate as best it could. Hospitals facing the greatest strain were willing to pay the highest rates to meet their demand. Many hospitals resorted to traveling nursing agencies to fill their short-term needs. Because of this extraordinary demand, those positions were being paid salaries exponentially higher than the typical full-time employment salary.

“One way to accommodate that demand is temporary workers moving to where they’re needed at the moment. The wages for these temp workers has gone through the roof,” Joshua Gottlieb, a health care economist at the University of Chicago, told me. “That is normal supply and demand. In the short term, it’s hard for quantities of workers to adjust, so prices have to adjust.”

This effect has been felt most acutely in the practice areas most strained by Covid-19 itself: ICU workers, ER nurses, etc. As Gottlieb and his co-author Avi Zenilman noted in the paper on labor market elasticity, the pandemic had not had appreciable effect on, for example, the wages of labor and delivery nurses.

But the pandemic may have still indirectly contributed to the circumstances that led ThedaCare to make such an extraordinary gambit to try to block employees from leaving the interventional radiology and cardiovascular team, which focuses on minimally invasive procedures for heart- and blood-related conditions.

Hospitals have on the whole fared okay during the pandemic, Spetz told me. There was a dramatic drop in elective procedures in the spring of 2020, but hospitals have largely been able to keep those services operating during subsequent waves. The federal government also provided substantial financial relief to the industry. That is not universally true — some hospitals have been forced to close as a result of Covid-19, concentrated in rural areas that were already struggling before the pandemic — but taken as a whole, the industry has not been as battered as much as was originally feared.

“There are exceptions, but one does not look at the hospital industry and say this is an industry that’s in big trouble,” she said. “It’s doing just fine from a profitability standpoint.”

But the government relief has since run out and the omicron variant put new unexpected pressure on hospital systems, forcing some to cancel or postpone more lucrative lines of services once again. Hospitals might be feeling the financial squeeze now more than ever, unless Congress appropriates another round of financial support.

And this kind of care — interventional radiology — in particular tends to be a moneymaker for hospitals, Neprash pointed out to me.

“They are doing the stuff that is really lucrative,” she said. She wondered what would have happened if members of the labor and delivery or the inpatient psychiatric teams, two less lucrative areas, had walked out. “It would not have put the institution’s revenue on the line.”

The gambit failed.

2022-01-19 12:00:51+00:00,6,"The Covid-19 vaccines available today are amazing feats of science. Researchers achieved in less than a year what can sometimes take decades: They targeted a new virus with multiple highly effective vaccines that have reached billions of people. They deployed new approaches like using messenger RNA and adenovirus vectors at large scales for the first time, making some of the biggest leaps in vaccine technology in hundreds of years.

But the limitations of these vaccines are becoming apparent, which is why some scientists are calling for an even bigger leap forward in vaccine technology. They envision a universal coronavirus vaccine that could counter every known variant of the virus that causes Covid-19, and even variants that haven’t emerged yet. It’s possible such a vaccine could protect against the whole family of coronaviruses, bolstering long-term immunity and slashing the risks of similar pandemics in the future.

This work is urgent because scientists are finding that protection from Covid-19 vaccines fades over time. And the virus itself is changing, mutating in ways that make it harder for the immune system to counter. The omicron variant has already caused breakthrough infections in large numbers of vaccinated people, and it’s a matter of time before the virus mutates again.

“We must now prioritize development of broadly protective vaccines like the universal influenza vaccines we have been working toward in recent years,” wrote National Institutes of Health researchers David Morens, Jeffery Taubenberger, and Anthony Fauci in the New England Journal of Medicine last month.

This crucial work is a long shot. It hinges on breakthroughs in technology and our current understanding of the immune system, because there’s a lot researchers still don’t know about how our cells defend us from infection. And the universal vaccine approaches that scientists are experimenting with — from universities and even the US Army — have never been used on large scales before.

Even the faint hope of preventing another global cataclysm — and contributing to the end of the one we’re living through now — deserves money and scientific attention, researchers told Vox. It could take years of sustained effort, but some researchers are confident that universal vaccines will emerge.

How do you make a universal coronavirus vaccine?

Before Covid-19 came along, vaccines followed a standard formula. They introduced the immune system to viral threats by injecting weakened or dead viruses, or virus fragments, into the body.

The Covid-19 pandemic was the dawn of a new era of vaccines. Adenovirus vector vaccines (like the one from Johnson and Johnson) and mRNA vaccines (like the ones from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech) deliver genetic instructions to human cells, so they can produce a fragment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The immune system uses these components for target practice. If the real pathogen arrives, the immune system has an action plan.

The challenge, even with these new vaccine platforms, is that the target practice is very specific, and it doesn’t always translate from one variant to another. If a virus mutates, vaccines can become less effective at stopping disease. Hence the need for a vaccine that can cover a spectrum of threats.

The first task in developing a universal vaccine is deciding how universal to make it. Will it be a vaccine aimed at all the variants of SARS-CoV-2? A vaccine for the broader category of sarbecoviruses that include the pathogens that cause SARS and MERS? Or a vaccine for the entire betacoronavirus genus?

“When we say universal vaccines, the word ‘universal,’ we have to put it in air quotes,” said Morens, who is a senior adviser to Fauci and a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “If we were to make a universal vaccine now, the first thing we’d want to do is have it be universal enough to cover all the strains that are circulating in people.”

But the wider the scope of the vaccine, the bigger the challenge.

Most Covid-19 vaccines train the immune system to identify the spike protein of the virus. This is the part of the virus that physically sticks out and starts the infection process by docking with a receptor on human cells. In a vaccine, the spike serves as an antigen — a component that activates the immune system.

Once the virus is identified, the immune system starts making proteins called antibodies. They bind to particular parts of the virus known as epitopes. If the antibodies interfere with the virus enough that they prevent it from causing an infection, they’re called neutralizing antibodies.

The spike protein is easily recognizable for the immune system, so vaccines that target it can generate robust protection. But vaccines also spur the virus to evolve, yielding an advantage to mutated spike proteins that are harder for the immune system to recognize. As a result, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the fastest-mutating parts of the virus, making it a moving target for the immune system.

Scientists are trying two main approaches to get around this problem, according to Deborah Fuller, a professor of microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

Strategy 1: Train the body to recognize a mosaic of spike proteins from many variants

One approach is to combine multiple antigens in a single shot. “You simply take as many spike proteins from as many different coronaviruses that are out there, and you decorate a virus-like nanoparticle protein with all of them,” Fuller said. The idea is that if the immune system tastes a sampler platter of enough distinct spike proteins, it will learn to fill in the blanks and cover most, if not all, potential mutations in SARS-CoV-2.

“There is a limit to the number of mutations it can eventually develop to fully evade the immune system, without compromising its own ability to attach to and infect cells,” Fuller said. “Once you get to a certain number of spike proteins, you get all the possible mutations represented within those.”

Using computational biology, scientists can simulate the spectrum of mutations and select the structures that have the greatest chances of providing broad-based immunity.

This is the approach that the US Army is currently investigating by attaching different SARS-CoV-2 spikes to a protein called ferritin. Its vaccine is currently in early clinical trials. (US Army researchers declined to comment until they finished analyzing their early results.)

Strategy 2: Vaccinate against parts of the coronavirus that don’t mutate

The other strategy is to target parts of the virus that stay the same even when the virus evolves, or the parts in common with its relatives (scientists describe these parts as “conserved”). This is the approach Fuller is studying in her laboratory.

Conserved regions are often parts of the virus that are critical to its function; the virus ceases functioning if they mutate. “If you target the parts that are conserved, then that would have, theoretically, protective efficacy against any of the coronaviruses that are out there,” Fuller said. That could extend to every past and future variant of SARS-CoV-2 and the broader group or family of coronaviruses it belongs to.

These conserved regions might be buried on parts of the virus that are less visible to the immune system, or physically difficult for antibodies to access when the virus is whole. But when a virus invades a cell and begins the infection process, fragments of the pathogen can show up on the outside of the host cell, including parts that were previously obscured. Antibodies can then attach to those fragments and get to work.

Such antibodies are described as non-neutralizing because they don’t prevent infection in the first place. But they recruit other players in the immune system, including B cells that manufacture antibodies and T cells that eliminate infected cells.

A universal vaccine that targets conserved regions might not prevent infection, according to Fuller, but it could turn dangerous coronaviruses into bugs that mostly cause minor illnesses. “It builds a level of immunity in the population such that anytime a coronavirus outbreak should occur, it really doesn’t have the fangs anymore to cause a pandemic,” she said.

Sounds straightforward enough, but there are many complications. First, not every conserved region makes a good antigen. Some will be completely ignored by the immune system and fail to generate a response. Second, scientists have to study the whole spectrum of coronaviruses to find out exactly which portions of the virus stay the same. Third, the immune system’s response to a conserved region might not be effective against an infection.

“If we can figure all that out — I’m confident we can — then we can design a universal coronavirus vaccine” that targets conserved regions, Fuller said.

It’s remarkably difficult to vaccinate against respiratory infections

There’s a big difference between drugs that treat illnesses and vaccines that try to prevent them. A doctor would only prescribe a treatment like chemotherapy, for example, after a patient has been diagnosed with advanced cancer; there are just too many risks and side effects for someone in an earlier stage of the disease to take such harsh medicines.

Vaccines, by contrast, are meant to prevent disease in billions of people. Regulators will only approve them if the risks are extremely low and side effects are extremely rare.

As a result, vaccine research is historically slow and expensive. The development costs are high, the timelines span decades, and the payoff is never guaranteed. That is, until Covid-19 came along and triggered a radical shift in this paradigm.

The urgency of the pandemic condensed the vaccine development timeline by injecting cash, inspiring many teams to join the effort, and by lowering administrative hurdles. The research supported by programs like Operation Warp Speed yielded a new generation of vaccines in record time. Beyond funding research on vaccine candidates, the US government promised to purchase millions of doses of their vaccines, even if some of those shots didn’t work out.

But the big limitation of current Covid-19 vaccines is that they were originally designed for the early versions of SARS-CoV-2. These vaccines may not be enough to contain a virus that’s constantly changing, especially since a large segment of the global population remains unvaccinated.

Respiratory viruses are also unusually challenging beasts. They tend to infect the outer cells of airways, known as the epithelium, rather than penetrating deeper into the body. Scientists theorize that the immune system has a harder time getting a lock on these pathogens and maintaining long-term protection after they pass.

“They’ve got a great trick,” Morens said. “They can infect us and cause disease, and make us cough and sneeze and force us to spread them around to others, and they don’t have to fight the big fight with our immune system.”

Then there’s the problem of vaccine testing. In the US, between the 249 million people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine and 67 million Covid-19 cases, the vast majority of the population has been exposed to some part of the virus. That means it’s going to be much harder to find people with zero immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus who can participate in a control group in a clinical trial. (There are workarounds — scientists manage to study cold pathogens and flu viruses even though countless people have antibodies to them — but they require different experimental protocols.)

All of this makes for a huge scientific challenge. Scientists have already been trying for years without success to develop a universal influenza vaccine. And there are many fundamental mysteries still lurking in this area of immunology.

Even a universal vaccine isn’t a silver bullet

Devoting more resources to universal vaccine research is critical, but such vaccines depend on breakthroughs and discoveries, too, so there’s no guarantee that they will come to fruition. “To make a universal vaccine is an order of magnitude more complicated,” Morens said. “Science has never been able to make a universal vaccine to anything, ever.”

And while vaccines are a critical way to keep an infectious disease in check, even a successful universal shot might not be enough to extinguish a pandemic and prevent the next one. For one thing, it’s not clear how long protection from such a shot would last.

“You could have a universal vaccine that covers every single coronavirus, but if the immunity it elicits wanes, it’s not that good,” Morens said. “I would define a universal vaccine not only to cover all the viruses, [but also] to induce durable immunity.”

Then there’s the question of how to deploy a universal vaccine. Would we need another vaccination campaign to get this shot into everyone’s arms, or would it be limited to people in high-risk groups? That might depend on the performance of the vaccine, as well as the state of the health care system and the level of coronavirus transmission. “Public health policies [would] have to be developed to decide who should be vaccinated,” Morens said.

And as we’ve learned from existing Covid-19 vaccines, it’s still important to limit transmission with social distancing and wearing face masks. Testing and sequencing remain critical for understanding the spread and evolution of the virus.

A universal coronavirus vaccine could eventually become one of public health’s most powerful tools. But it will need to work in tandem with all of the other strategies that have proven useful in the past two years.",voxdotcom,"['immune', 'defeat', 'virus', 'covid19', 'vaccine', 'universal', 'parts', 'spike', 'variant', 'system', 'scientists', 'vaccines']",0
2022-01-18 13:30:09+00:00,12,"In vaccinated and boosted people, breakthrough Covid-19 cases can often be quite mild, akin to an annoying cold; these relatively manageable symptoms can result in infected people dismissing a slightly scratchy throat and perhaps forgoing testing. The “what is a symptom” question is also impacting those who do test positive, with new federal guidelines relying on symptoms as a deciding factor in whether you go back to work or stay home after testing positive for Covid-19 — especially for essential workers and those who don’t have paid time off.

In December 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its recommendations for isolation after a positive test, with the number of days someone must isolate being largely dependent on the presence of symptoms. Now, people who test positive but do not develop symptoms must isolate for just five days; if they remain asymptomatic, they can end isolation after five days (but continue to wear a mask around others at home and in public for another five days).

To help you better understand what “counts” as a symptom, Vox spoke to three experts.

“No symptoms” means you feel your best

Defined by the CDC as “when a person is infected with a virus and will never feel any symptoms at all,” asymptomatic has become a catchall phrase for those who feel fine and aren’t exhibiting any of the common markers of Covid-19 — lack of taste or smell, dry cough, fever — but still test positive and appear to be capable of spreading the virus.

In the age of omicron, when symptoms can be almost imperceptible, asymptomatic means absolutely no sniffles, coughs, or aches of any kind. “Asymptomatic means you feel in your best shape ever,” says Jorge Salinas, an assistant professor of medicine and hospital epidemiologist at Stanford University. “You are doing great. You feel amazing, nothing bothers you.”

Because community transmission is so high right now, it’s best to assume you’ve been exposed to someone who has Covid-19 if you’ve been to a public place recently, Salinas says. Everyone should act as though they’ve come in contact with the virus and are potentially infected, and if anything feels off beyond your normal aches and pains (like your chronic lower back pain or regular migraines), you should consider it a symptom.

Tolerance for pain or illness varies from person to person — what one person considers a mild cold might feel like a more disruptive flu to another — and a little throat tickle may not ping as “sick” to you in ordinary circumstances. But these aren’t ordinary circumstances. No matter the severity, any cough, sneeze, headache, or body ache should be viewed as a symptom.

“What we often find in people who are vaccinated and get Covid is they think they are asymptomatic but when you talk to them, they have had a slight cough they thought was allergies, they had a little bit of a runny nose, they had a little bit of a sore throat,” says John D. Goldman, an infectious disease specialist at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “There are a lot of people who either truly have no symptoms or have such minor symptoms that they don’t think that they’re sick enough to have Covid.”

One part of the problem is that medical professionals struggle to offer more concrete guidelines on how to categorize “asymptomatic.” “Currently, there are no data available to define ‘asymptomatic,’ which can be different in different people, given that many have chronic respiratory symptoms as baseline, from congestive heart failure to allergies,” says Michael David, assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

The key is to determine any differences between how you feel on your best days and right now. However, experts admit, this comparison is no simple task. If you typically have a runny nose after biking to work in the cold, it’s difficult to gauge whether today’s runny nose is normal or an indicator of something more serious. “If you really start thinking about it, we all have a little thing here and there,” Salinas says. “It is exceedingly difficult to really say that somebody’s asymptomatic.”

Make sure you know what Covid-19 symptoms can look like

Knowing the signs of Covid-19 is crucial to monitoring your own symptoms, or lack thereof. According to the CDC, symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, body aches, headaches, sore throat, congestion, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Omicron symptoms tend to stray slightly, with data out of South Africa indicating that people with omicron experience a ​​scratchy or sore throat, nasal congestion, dry cough, and muscle pain, including low back pain. Other experts have said to look out for a runny nose and/or headache.

It’s also wise to take note of the overall number of symptoms you’re experiencing. “The more symptoms you have, the more likely it’s a respiratory infection,” Salinas says. A combination of sore throat, headache, and sniffles is likely not a coincidence.

While monitoring how you feel day-to-day can help you catch symptoms as they emerge, ironically, by thinking too much about how you’re feeling, you could start tricking yourself into manifesting symptoms. The combination of anxiety and overthinking can lead you to magnify every little ache and pain, Salinas says. The only way to know for sure is to get tested; if you’ve already tested positive, the best way to gauge your symptoms is to re-test five days after first testing positive.

If you need meds to manage your symptoms, you have symptoms

Congestion that you’re treating with DayQuil or a headache that necessitates taking pain relievers is a red flag you’re experiencing a symptom, Goldman says. Not only are you feeling less than your best, you’re also hiding that crucial information from your family, co-workers, roommates — and yourself.

“If you’re masking the symptoms, you’re more likely to go to work, you’re more likely to do things that will spread the disease,” he says. “Taking Tylenol, doing something to deal with the symptoms is certainly not going to hurt you. It may just be that you go outside and you aren’t aware you’re sick and spread it to someone else.” He recommends getting tested to confirm (insurance companies must now pay for eight at-home tests a month per family member and Americans will soon be able to order free at-home tests) and doing everything you can to avoid others while you feel sick.

Continue to rely on tried-and-true mitigation methods

For people who think they may be experiencing symptoms but need to leave the house, the safest way to move about society requires wearing a high-quality mask around others, Salinas says, and isolating to the extent that you can. At this stage in the pandemic, Americans desperately need universal paid sick leave and free and easily accessible testing; until that happens, individuals will unfairly remain responsible for interpreting their symptoms as best they can.

Unless you’re able to regularly test, take note of how you’re feeling every day and continue to mask up in public settings. If you feel healthy without pain relievers and cold medicines, considering your own circumstances and history, you can safely assume you’re without symptoms, experts say. Anything less than your best means you should take every sniffle, ache, or cough seriously.",voxdotcom,"['really', 'covid19', 'guide', 'asymptomatic', 'feel', 'throat', 'symptoms', 'salinas', 'positive', 'best', 'youre', 'pain']",0
2022-01-14 12:01:04+00:00,16,"Over the past two years, the United States has seen more than 63 million Covid-19 cases, with some people infected more than once. More than 240 million people in the US have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 60 million have received three.

While Covid-19 infections are never a good thing, these numbers still add up to a glimmer of good news: A large majority of Americans now have some immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. That’s a big step toward defanging the disease.

When the human body is infected by the virus or encounters a fragment of the pathogen in a vaccine, our immune systems change in subtle but important ways. Across a huge swath of the population, these changes could eventually help transform Covid-19 from a world-stopping catastrophe into a mild annoyance.

Antibodies, proteins that attach to the virus, are a critical part of the immune response and are often the center of discussions about protection from Covid-19. But they rise during infection and decline naturally over time. Fortunately, antibodies are not the whole story when it comes to the immune system.

Other, longer-lasting tools against infection are hiding inside our bones. The immune system draws on stem cells living in bone marrow to produce an array of components that we don’t hear as much about. They form many kinds of white blood cells that jump into action right away when they encounter a virus for the first time, and that essentially take notes to start planning for the next infection.

It’s this immune system memory that’s key to long-term protection against Covid-19. What’s reassuring is that as white blood cells get more practice against SARS-CoV-2, they seem to get better at containing the virus — even when it evolves into new variants. That appears to be happening in the omicron wave of Covid-19.

Related What makes the omicron variant so strange and surprising

Omicron is the most transmissible variant of the coronavirus known to date. It also appears to be better at dodging immune protection from Covid-19 vaccines. Cases have reached record levels in many parts of the United States, and hospitals are once again straining under the burden.

But the fraction of cases leading to hospitalizations and deaths appears to be far smaller compared to other variants. While there are more reports of breakthrough infections and reinfections with omicron, many previously exposed people report mild, cold-like symptoms.

One reason is that the virus itself appears to have mutated in a way that leads to fewer dangerous complications. Yet it’s also clear that widespread immunity is absorbing some of the worst effects of the disease, a hopeful trend that is likely to continue in 2022 and beyond.

Meet your B cells and T cells, your enduring pandemic protectors

The world is full of so many things that can make us sick — viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, even mutated versions of our own cells. The threats are varied and unrelenting, but so too is our immune system. It’s an orchestra of cells, proteins, organs, and pathways that all harmonize to keep invaders at bay. In simplified form, here’s how.

When a pathogen like the coronavirus enters the body for the first time, it confronts the innate immune system, which provides generalized protection against all pathogens, but isn’t always enough to prevent illness on its own. After an infection takes root, the immune system launches a more targeted response with what’s known as the adaptive immune system.

Neutralizing antibodies form the pillar of the adaptive immune system. The virus is studded with spike proteins (giving it its namesake corona, meaning crown in Latin), which attach to human cells to begin the infection process. Y-shaped antibodies can attach to the spikes on the virus and prevent it from entering cells, thereby neutralizing the pathogen. The parts of a virus that can trigger an immune response are known as antigens.

“In general, neutralizing antibodies keep you from getting infected in the first place,” said Lewis Lanier, chair of the microbiology and immunology department at the University of California San Francisco.

Neutralizing antibodies are picky about the parts of the virus they recognize, known as epitopes. If those attachment points on the virus change, as they do in many coronavirus variants, antibodies can become less effective. In the months following an infection or immunization, the amount of these neutralizing antibodies declines as well. That’s expected. Making antibodies takes a lot of energy, so the body makes fewer of them after an infection is gone.

That decline may sound worrisome, but the immune system has other powerful tools in its shed. To start, there are non-neutralizing antibodies. These don’t directly interfere with how the virus functions, but they can help the immune system detect infected cells and mark them for destruction. This is a crucial task because viruses can’t make copies of themselves on their own: They need to commandeer a host cell to reproduce. Once a virus enters a cell, it’s not accessible to neutralizing antibodies, but non-neutralizing antibodies that learned to recognize infected cells can still raise the alarm.

The task of eliminating infected cells falls to a group of white blood cells known as cytotoxic T cells, sometimes called killer T cells. They arise from stem cells in bone marrow and cause infected cells to self-destruct, without messing with normal cells.

“T cells, they cannot prevent infection,” said Lanier. “The only way a T cell can recognize you have an infection is after a cell has been infected.”

Helper T cells are another important white blood cell variety. They spur the production of antibodies by a different group of white blood cells called B cells. B cells form in bone marrow and then migrate to lymph nodes or the spleen.

After an infection or a vaccination, some B cells and T cells stick around, becoming memory B cells and T cells. They sit idle, sometimes for decades, waiting to see if a pathogen returns. If it does, they can quickly reactivate.

This is why we a decline in neutralizing antibody counts isn’t always a disaster. Even if concentrations of neutralizing antibodies dip so low that they can no longer prevent an infection, other parts of the immune system can spool up to make sure the virus doesn’t do too much damage.

“There is a window of time after virus gets into the body before it really starts manifesting disease in the person,” said Deborah Fuller, a professor of microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “That window of time enables the immune system that has been vaccinated and has memory immune responses to recall very quickly and shut down the virus before it actually causes disease.”

Our immune systems are adapting — but so is the virus

Some health officials now say that Covid-19 is so rampant that most people are likely to become infected at some point. “It’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is most people are going to get Covid,” Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration told the Senate health committee on Tuesday. “What we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.”

However, waves of infection can crest just as quickly as they form. Countries like the United Kingdom and South Africa experienced awful omicron spikes but subsequently saw precipitous drops in cases thereafter. Omicron cases also appear to be leveling off in some parts of the US, a sign that a decline may be ahead.

Whether these spikes in Covid-19 cases lead to severe health outcomes hinges on the teamwork of B cells, T cells, and antibodies, and how they hold up against any new mutations in the virus. It’s an area of active research for scientists.

“Vaccines and prior infection may not prevent you from being infected by the next waves of variants, but it may well keep you out of the hospital,” Lanier said.

For the past two years, with recurring spikes in Covid-19 cases, neutralizing antibodies have taken center stage. “We’re really more concerned right now in the middle of the pandemic about the durability of that antibody because what we’re trying to do is prevent transmission,” said Fuller. But that could change.

Neutralizing antibodies remain a key benchmark for vaccines: Scientists judge the success and timing of vaccines in part by measuring the number of antibodies they provoke in our blood, and how long the antibodies stick around. When the mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were in development, they demonstrated that they could elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies. Further clinical trials showed that this translated to more than 90 percent efficacy in preventing illness.

The next test is how well antibody production ramps back up if the same virus invades again. It can take up to two weeks to generate antibodies after being exposed to a virus for the first time, but production can ramp up much faster during a second infection.

At the same time, a virus is rarely the same when it comes back. Viruses mutate frequently as they reproduce, and RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are especially prone to change. Versions of the virus with distinct groupings of mutations are categorized as variants, like omicron, delta, and alpha. Our immune systems are getting stronger and faster, but changes to the virus still have the potential to throw them for a loop.

Already, some companies are developing omicron-specific vaccines, but they may not hit the market for months. The reformulated shots may be too little, too late. In the meantime, we have to rely on the immunity we already have, including boosts to our antibody counts that come from booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines.

We will eventually reach a balance with Covid-19

There is still much to learn about how all the elements of the immune system work together over time to hold off Covid-19, and some of the answers will only become evident with time. And the odd behavior of omicron is forcing researchers to rethink what they’ve learned.

The good news is that many aspects of our immune system also appear to handle the latest variant well. “From what I’ve seen, the T cell responses are still working rather well against omicron,” said Brianne Barker, a vaccine researcher at Drew University. “I think that we’ve still got a bit of time” in which immune protections will remain intact.

Immunity will continue building across the population and will blunt the sharp edges of the pandemic, even as the virus changes. Covid-19 is unlikely to go away entirely. As it circulates, it will continue to mutate and may cause sporadic outbreaks. But our immune systems are making progress.

“As you expose the human body, even to the same antigen over and over again, our immune system evolves as well,” Fuller said. “What we’re starting to see in people with third immunizations is an antibody [response] that is broader.”

It’s a good sign that improvements in our immune system are likely to outpace changes in the virus. But the pandemic has also made it clear that there is nothing about its trajectory we can take for granted. While the cells within us may shield against infection, it’s still a good idea to limit transmission of the virus in any other way we can. The fewer people it infects, the fewer unpleasant surprises ahead.",voxdotcom,"['longterm', 'virus', 'covid19', 'neutralizing', 'antibodies', 'system', 'infected', 'cells', 'immunity', 'infection', 'omicron', 'look', 'immune']",0
2022-01-07 20:30:16+00:00,136,"Editor’s note, January 13, 2:40 pm: The Supreme Court on Thursday overturned the Biden administration’s rule requiring most workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be regularly tested for the disease. It allowed another, narrower rule requiring health providers that accept Medicare and Medicaid funds to be vaccinated, to stand.

Benjamin Flowers is Ohio’s solicitor general, and he was supposed to be at the Supreme Court on Friday to ask the justices to nullify a Biden administration rule requiring most workers to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or to be regularly tested for the disease.

But Flowers had to argue his case over the phone. The reason why? He himself has Covid, and therefore could not enter the justices’ workplace and risk endangering them and their staff.

It’s an elegant metaphor for the kind of see-no-evil approach to Covid-19 that Flowers, and several other lawyers arguing against policies from President Joe Biden’s administration, would impose on the nation. Flowers would have the justices block one of Biden’s most significant efforts to halt a potentially deadly disease that, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted multiple times during Friday’s arguments, is infecting about three-quarters of a million Americans every day this week.

And yet, if Friday’s argument in National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor is any sign, there will almost certainly be at least five votes on the Supreme Court to block the workplace Covid rule, which applies to employers with 100 or more employees.

Meanwhile, in separate case Biden v. Missouri, the Court considered a rule requiring health providers that accept Medicare and Medicaid funds to be vaccinated. This oral argument was less of a bloodbath for the government, and it seems possible that this more limited rule for health providers will be upheld.

But the oral argument in the first case, NFIB, suggests that the Court’s 6-3 conservative majority is inclined to hand down a very broad decision — one that won’t simply hobble many of the Biden administration’s efforts to quell a pandemic that has killed nearly 830,000 Americans, but that could also fundamentally rework the balance of power between elected federal officials and an unelected judiciary.

Both the NFIB case and the Missouri case involve very broadly worded laws, enacted by Congress, which give federal agencies sweeping authority to protect the health and safety of workers or Medicare patients. But all six of the Court’s Republican appointees appeared uncomfortable with letting these agencies — and especially the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) — fully exercise the power Congress has given them.

Multiple justices appeared eager to impose new restrictions on Congress’s ability to delegate authority to federal agencies. Indeed, the Court could easily give itself a sweeping new power to veto agency regulations that a majority of the justices disapprove of.

A majority of the Court, in other words, appeared much more bothered by the implications of letting the Biden administration fight the pandemic than they are bothered by the many deaths caused by the pandemic itself.

If the Court does wind up drastically shrinking the federal government’s authority, that won’t exactly be a surprise. The Court’s been signaling that it is eager to transfer power from federal agencies to the judiciary since shortly after then-President Donald Trump replaced the relatively moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy with hardline conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

But, while the Court has foreshadowed the most likely result in the NFIB case for quite a while, that does not mean that a decision striking down OSHA’s vaccinate-or-test rule would be any less profound. NFIB is likely to be a turning point in the right-wing Roberts Court’s relationship with the elected branches — and it could permanently disable the federal government’s ability to address crises like the Covid-19 pandemic in the future.

The Republican-appointed justices don’t want the Biden administration to make important decisions.

As mentioned above, Congress enacted several provisions of law that give certain federal agencies broad authority to protect the public health. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) permits OSHA to issue binding rules that provide “medical criteria which will assure insofar as practicable that no employee will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy as a result of his work experience.”

Typically, OSHA must follow a slow process to do so, but a separate provision allows it to issue an “emergency temporary standard” if the agency determines that “employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful,” and that such a standard is “necessary to protect employees from such danger.”

Meanwhile, a separate statute provides that health providers who accept Medicare or Medicaid funds are bound by rules that the secretary of Health and Human Services “finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.”

These kinds of legislative delegations of policymaking authority to agencies are very common, both in the United States and in other modern democracies. As the Court explained in Mistretta v. United States (1989), “in our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.”

Although the plaintiffs in both cases argued that neither statute’s text authorizes the particular vaccination rules implemented by OSHA and the secretary, the argument in NFIB focused far less on the proper way to parse the OSH Act, and much more on whether Congress is even permitted to give such sweeping authority to a federal agency.

And the Court’s conservative majority seemed to agree it isn’t permitted to. Several justices, for example, brought up the “Major Questions Doctrine,” a judicially created doctrine that appears in no statute and that is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution, but which the Court sometimes uses to justify striking down particularly ambitious regulations promulgated by federal agencies.

Under it, the Court has told Congress to “speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance,’” in a principle laid out in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014). As Justice Elena Kagan noted, this doctrine has historically been used to help the Court understand statutes that it deems to be ambiguous or vague.

But it now appears likely that the Court will expand this Major Questions Doctrine considerably, holding that it limits Congress’s power to delegate broad swaths of authority to a federal agency — even if Congress does so unambiguously.

Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, implied that a federal agency’s power to respond to Covid-19 might be quite limited indeed unless Congress specifically authorized that agency to deal with a pandemic. Though Roberts seemed to concede that the OSH Act’s text gives a great deal of authority to the agency, he noted that that law is more than 50 years old, before quipping that when Congress enacted the OSH Act, “I don’t think it had Covid in mind.”

Justice Brett Kavanaugh made a similar argument, pointing to a speech President George W. Bush gave in 2005, which predicted the emergence of a deadly global pandemic. And yet, Kavanaugh noted, Congress did not pass a new law addressing Bush’s concerns. The implication of Kavanaugh’s remarks was that pre-2005 laws, such as the OSH Act, are insufficient to justify OSHA’s actions.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, suggested that she might support a vaccination rule that targets workplaces where there is an especially high risk that workers will be infected by Covid, such as a meatpacking plant or a dental office, but she also suggested that OSHA’s rule is too broad. The “problem here is its scope,” she said of OSHA’s rule. And she suggested that OSHA would have to perform a “more targeted industry by industry analysis” if it wishes to encourage vaccination in individual workplaces.

Although Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett are all extraordinarily conservative justices, they represent the middle of the current Court, with its six Republican appointees. So if none of these three justices are inclined to uphold the OSHA rule, it’s almost impossible to imagine that the rule will survive.

Several justices, it’s worth noting, also suggested that OSHA’s vaccination rule is suspect because it is unprecedented — pointing out that OSHA has not historically imposed vaccination requirements.

But there are two very good responses to this concern, both of which were made by the Justice Department lawyers tasked with defending the two vaccination rules. The first is that the United States typically promotes vaccination by requiring vaccines for schoolchildren and for immigrants. That means that by the time an adult enters the US workforce, they have typically already been vaccinated against an array of diseases.

But Covid-19 emerged in 2019, and the vaccines only became widely available in 2021. So most workers did not enter the workforce with the same protection against Covid-19 that they have against, say, diphtheria.

The second problem with the argument that OSHA’s rule is invalid because it is unprecedented is that it also is a response to an unprecedented crisis. According to the Biden administration, Covid-19 is the deadliest disease in American history. It is certainly the worst public health crisis since the great influenza pandemic of 1918.

But, regardless of whether the OSHA rule may be wise, the Court appears likely to strike it down anyway.

The vaccination mandate for health workers could survive

That said, it appears after the argument in the Missouri case that the rule targeting health providers could survive. Barrett’s question about vaccine mandates which target specific industries, for example, suggests that her vote is in play in the Missouri case.

Similarly, Chief Justice Roberts noted that the rule for health providers is different from the OSHA rule in that it only applies to hospitals and other institutions that accept federal funding. It’s one thing, he seemed to suggest, for the government to command broad swaths of employers to do something, and another thing entirely for the government to effectively pay those employers to encourage vaccination.

Kavanaugh also had some difficult questions for Jesus Osete, the lawyer for the state of Missouri who argued against the health provider’s rule. Among other things, Kavanaugh noted that major health employers and health-related professional organizations generally support vaccination requirements. He also asked why a vaccination requirement is different in any legally significant way from other requirements Medicare and Medicaid impose on health providers, such as rules requiring them to wear gloves and wash their hands, in order to arrest the spread of communicable disease.

So the Court could potentially hand down split decisions in NFIB and Missouri, striking down the OSHA rule and upholding the health providers’ rule. A majority of the justices appeared more comfortable with the limited power the Biden administration exercised in the Missouri case than they were with the broader power it exercised in NFIB.

That may be a comfort to anyone who doesn’t want to catch Covid from their doctor, but it should not comfort anyone who believes that unelected judges should not have an unrestricted veto power over federal policy. The bottom line remains that Congress wrote expansive language when it passed the OSH Act, and OSHA relied on its expertise when it handed down a broad vaccination-or-test rule.

But neither the will of Congress nor the considered judgment of an expert agency appear to matter when five justices oppose a rule.",voxdotcom,"['federal', 'biden', 'supreme', 'covid19', 'rule', 'health', 'power', 'vaccination', 'afraid', 'justices', 'congress', 'court', 'providers', 'osha']",0
