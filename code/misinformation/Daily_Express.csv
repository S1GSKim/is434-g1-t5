2021-02-26 20:00:01+00:00,2,"Brexit: Boris Johnson praises work of negotiator David Frost

Jayne Ayde, Director of cross-party grassroots Eurosceptic campaign Get Britain Out, has suggested Boris Johnson will only turn his Global Britain vision into a reality if the UK “embraces Brexit in its entirety” - and told Brussels in no uncertain terms it would not dance to their tune. Ms Ayde, writing on the Brexit Watch website, was commenting in the wake of Mr Johnson announcing his Roadmap to Recovery which sets out the process whereby Britain will emerge from the current lockdown and end all restrictions by June 21.

She said: “While the speed of this release from lockdown is still up for debate, the reality is no matter when we come out the other side, our economic recovery will not reach full potential if we do not also unlock ourselves from the shackles of the EU.” As things stood, unemployment was at 5.1 percent, with the economy only narrowly avoiding a double-dip recession, she pointed out. She added: “If we are to really ‘Build Back Better’ – as the Prime Minister envisions – then cutting away EU ‘red tape’ is the first place to start.

“We cannot hit the ground running if businesses are still dealing with uncertainty over the regulations they need to follow, or if there are new borders within the United Kingdom, as is currently the case between Great Britain and Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland Protocol.” She cited as one example the financial services industry, which she described as “the UK’s biggest export around the world”. She warned: “As it stands, however, it is currently in limbo, with no certainty over the access such businesses will have to EU markets.

“Nor do they know if or how the UK will separate from EU regulations. “These decisions could open additional doors for innovation and opportunities for new business. “It’s the financial services industry which will provide some of the biggest contributions to getting our economy back on track and improving at a faster rate than our European rivals.

“So why is the government so reluctant to set out a clear roadmap for our independent economic future?” One prime example of the EU’s red tape problems had been uncovered this week following a recent study by the Association of British Insurers, Mrs Ayde pointed out. This indicated there was is potential for the removal of EU regulation forcing insurance companies to keep vast amounts of money locked in ultra-low risk assets.

She said: “Apparently, by removing the regulation, it would pave the way for £95 billion in investment throughout the UK, while having no detrimental impact to policyholders.” Mrs Ayde added: “The only way we can advance a truly global agenda and succeed in proving the correct course of action for the UK, is to embrace Brexit in its entirety. “This means making it clear to the EU, we will not accept permanent regulatory alignment for our industries and we must dismantle many of the barriers to global business which have been established through our EU membership. “London has continued to prosper since we originally signed up to the European Union – or the European Economic Community as it was then – but this has been in spite of the European Union, not because of it.

Despite the NHS struggling to give staff adequate provisions, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) sent thousands of pounds worth of equipment to the eastern European state. At the height of the pandemic, the MoD sent a £24,816 shipment of PPE to Ukraine. Express.co.uk commentator, Frederick Forsyth, shed light on the matter in an explosive attack on the wasted money and equipment by the department.

In his comment piece, he said: “The Ministry of Defence, as our Army is cut to the bone and into the marrow, spent £24,816 sending Covid-protective PPE clothing to the Ukrainian army. “And there were we thinking British nurses were working without any.” In a Freedom of Information request from the Taxpayers Alliance, the donation was made to Ukraine to aid their response. In the shipment, the MoD sent 41,050 surgical face masks, respirators and infrared thermometers to Ukraine.

While the NHS was having to scramble to provide equipment for staff, the former deputy head of mission at the British embassy in Kiev Helen Fazey, said it showed the unity between the two nations. She said: “Responding to COVID-19 is a challenge all countries share. “This donation is one way in which we show solidarity between the UK and Ukraine.” An MoD spokesman said in a statement: “Following an emergency request for assistance, purchases were made in-country and had no impact on UK supply chains.” JUST IN: Brexit LIVE: EU plots 'major reset' with UK - Frost prepares for talks

While the amounts of PPE was sent abroad, the UK was found to have failed to stockpile adequate supplies at the peak of the pandemic. Such was the dire state of affairs, staff claimed they were at risk due to the short supplies. According to a report from the BBC, there were 33 million pieces of PPE in the stockpile as of 2009. As of April 2020, the report found that level had fallen to 12 million. DON'T MISS

To combat the virus, the NHS needs vast amounts of PPE equipment per month and it is advised not to reuse the items. Indeed, although the UK has now passed the first wave of the virus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has come under fire for claiming there had been no shortage of equipment. He defended the work his team had done and instead claimed no shortage had occurred because of his staff. Despite the severe issues suffered due to coronavirus last year and this January, the UK has begun to turn the curve in its battle with the pandemic.

BBC Question Time guests were asked whether they agreed with proposed plans to introduce vaccine passports to reopen and protect businesses. However, when audience members were invited to speak one man pointed out the coronavirus documents already exist and it would be right for businesses to deny entry to anyone who does not have one. Members of the show were taken back as some had not thought of the man’s point of view before.

Speaking on BBC Question Time about the documents, the audience member called Steve said: “It already exists in a way, I'm lucky enough to have had my first vaccination. “And what do you get back from the vaccination you get a little card that gives the details of the date, time of vaccination. “Now assuming that my situation is not unique, then it probably means that majority of people have already had such a document. “Now, business owners can decide at their own whim whether or not to serve people.

Steve explained the documents already exist

Guests on the show did not consider about the cards handed out at vaccination hubs

“If they choose to say, if you can't show proof that you've had a vaccination, then the person is legally entitled to do that. “So, the point is really a vaccination passport almost exists already.” Earlier in the show, another audience member blasted the use of the vaccine passports by branding them “unethical”. She disagreed with the idea of a “two-tier society” which prevented people from living their lives based on whether they have has their injections.

Meanwhile the French government has warned the COVID-19 situation in 10 regional departments, including the one which contains Paris, is “worrying”. According to the Our World In Data website, just 6.25 dose of coronavirus vaccine per 100 people have been administered in the EU, compared with 27.34 in the UK.

In France, the figure is 5.88 - even lower than the bloc-wide average. The situation has been exacerbated by the news that AstraZeneca will not be able to deliver all the doses promised in the second quarter of the year, while Janssen's vaccine is expected to arrive in May, not April. Mr Macron himself had previously stoked controversy when he claimed AstraZeneca’s jab, developed in conjunction with Oxford University, as “quasi-effective” for over-65s.

Mr Beaune, who is Secretary of State in charge of European affairs, told French current affairs programme 4 Vérités: “Regarding AstraZeneca, when there were delivery delays announced a few weeks ago, that's what we are talking about. “Between February and March, there are some delivery delays. “What was announced in the first quarter for France and for Europe will be respected.

""Seven million doses will have arrived in France by the end of February. “We will more than double this number by the end of March and we will reach 35 million doses in April."" In order to turn the tide it was crucial to make up for delays as much as possible, Mr Beaune stressed. He added: “This was the case with Pfizer: we made up for these delays, we increased delivery capacities in the coming weeks. For Moderna, it was the same.”

Mr Bueane was speaking at a time of rising concern about the COVID-19 situation within his own country. Speaking after today’s Cabinet meeting, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said the government was ready to take extra measures to limit infections. He explained: ""The situation is deteriorating and it is a source of worry in about 10 regional departments and some regions require rapid and strong measures. ""We have shown in regions such as Moselle and Alpes-Maritimes that, when the situation requires it, we can act quickly.""

Sir Patrick said the UK could see a big ""resurgence"" in Covid cases after new documents predicted tens of thousands more deaths if restrictions ease too quickly. He told a media briefing: ""The sooner you open up everything, the higher the risk of a bigger resurgence,"" he said. ""The slower you do it, the better. ""And importantly, if you want to understand what you're doing because we don't know for sure what the effects of the different measures are, do steps with enough time between them that you can measure data.

""And that means probably allowing something like four or five weeks between each step - four weeks to be able to measure the effects of the step you've just taken, and then a week for people to actually get ready in terms of what needs to happen."" Sir Patrick said that though there was encouraging evidence from Britain's vaccine rollout, it could not be ""off to the races"", as the Prime Minister outlines his blueprint to ease restrictions in England that have been in place for the past two months. He said: ""We are in a not very good position, which is getting better. ""The message that comes out of all of the modelling is get (infection) numbers down before you start releasing, go slowly, (and) go in blocks that you can measure the effect of after four or five weeks.""

Boris Johnson has been warned to take a cautious approach to exiting lockdown

The latest warning comes as documents published by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) show how modelling predicts a significant rise in Covid infections and deaths if lockdown restrictions are eased too quickly. Sir Patrick warned that even achieving good national coverage with highly effective Covid vaccines, a large part of the country's population would remain unprotected, which is central to the cautious approach to easing lockdown measures. Summarising what the documents show, he said: ""Vaccines are predicted - as you'd expect and hope - to make a big difference. ""But even with high vaccine levels, and indeed quite high vaccine coverage, it's important to remember that a large number of people in the population remain unprotected.""

""So if were to let a big epidemic happen among younger people, then some of those vulnerable older people, or people who are vulnerable for another reason, will get infected and will become very ill."" In a document from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) dated February 17, modelling by the University of Warwick and Imperial College London is set out, which warns even under the most optimistic assumptions, at least an additional 30,000 deaths from Covid could occur.

Whiley pulled out of her Radio 2 presenting duties to help her family and speaking to Andrew Marr, explained it has been the “worst week of their lives” as Frances struggled with being given oxygen to help fight the virus.

Asked how Frances was doing, Whiley began: “I don’t know this morning so I’m slightly anxious, I’ve been trying to call my mum and I haven’t heard anything so waking up to having no news is a scary thing. “It’s been the worst week of our lives without a shadow of a doubt. 24 hours ago we were talking palliative care and yesterday she rallied round and we are seeing her oxygen levels rise. “At the moment, we’ve got hope. 24 hours ago we didn’t have any hope at all.

He told leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission: “Even as we fight to get out of the teeth of this pandemic, the resurgence of Ebola in Africa is a stark reminder we must simultaneously work to finally finance healths security.

“Strengthen global health systems and create early warning systems to prevent, detect and respond to future biological threats. Because they will keep coming.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) yesterday announced it was stepping up its efforts to curb Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Health authorities in Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak on February 14 after three cases were detected in Gouécké, a rural community in N’Zerekore prefecture tested positive for the virus.

“While the world is reeling from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Ebola has again emerged, simultaneously, in both Central and West Africa. “The world cannot afford to turn the other way. We must do everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively, and with commensurate resources to stop these outbreaks before they become large-scale epidemics.” Mr Biden had been briefed on the situation in both central and west Africa, the statement explained.

It added: “The Biden Administration will do everything in its power to provide US leadership to stop these outbreaks, working with the affected governments, the World Health Organization, the African Union and the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and neighbouring states.” Ebola Virus Disease is a severe, frequently fatal illness that affects humans and other primates, and which was first identified in 1976. The virus is transmitted to people via wild animals including fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates, and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected individuals. The average fatality rate is about 50 percent, although case fatality rates have ranged from 25 percent all the way up to 90 percent in past outbreaks.

Covid vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks before they are administered by medical professionals to the general public. All vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict safety standards and it is hoped their rollout will help to prevent further hospitalisations and deaths from coronavirus. However, despite overwhelming assurances from medical experts that vaccines are in fact safe and effective, some attempt to discredit them. Anti-vax videos and messages have been common during the pandemic, as demonstrated by the Ask the Experts video which circulated on WhatsApp.

BBC Panorama has investigated the rise of anti-vaccine content on social media platforms, with the research due to air on Monday night. The programme investigated a video a woman called Rosemary, 83, was sent via Whatsapp called ‘Ask the Experts’. The video features several people based around the world with medical titles, claiming that Covid vaccines are not safe for use.

Are Covid vaccines safe? Vaccines have now been in use for several years and have been credited with eradicating several deadly diseases in the past, such as smallpox. Some people’s concern about vaccine safety may have been prompted by the relatively quick speed the Covid vaccines have been developed and approved compared to other vaccines in the past. However, all of the vaccines approved in the UK have met the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) strict standards of safety. Approved Covid vaccines have all been tested in clinical trials involving thousands of people. In the UK alone, more than 15 million people have received at least one dose of an approved Covid vaccine. Reports of serious side effects, like allergic reactions, have been very rare according to the NHS. No long-term complications have been reported for any of the vaccines currently in use in the UK either. DON'T MISS:

Many social media posts have centred on the idea that Covid vaccines can alter your DNA, but this just isn’t the case. Many Covid vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, are forms of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. Although some traditional vaccines may use modified or inactive forms of a virus to help people build up immunity, mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. The mRNA vaccines use codes for a specific antigen which, when produced within the body, is recognised by the immune system. After cells have made copies of the harmless virus protein unique to the virus, the body destroys the genetic material from the vaccine. The immune system is then equipped with antibodies prepared to fight a real case of the virus in the future. A person’s DNA is not altered by the process.

The study, which was reported on by TechCrunch, enlisted the help of ""several hundred"" healthcare workers with data collected over a period of several months - from April to September.

Those who participated had to use an Apple Watch and an iPhone app to monitor and collect health data.

Those involved also had to fill out daily surveys so there was feedback about potential Covid-19 symptoms and other factors such as stress.

The main metric that researchers looked at was heart rate variability (HRV), which acts as a key indicator of strain on the nervous system.

Researchers from Singapore's Duke-NUS Medical School and Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University took samples from bats in a wildlife sanctuary in Eastern Thailand and found the new virus called RacCS203 shared 91.5 percent of its genetic code with SARS-CoV-2 - the coronavirus which sparked the global pandemic.

The introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway Peter Ben Embarek

But despite its genetically similarities the newly-discovered virus has key differences from SARS-CoV-2 which scientists believe makes it unlikely to infect people as it can not bind to the ACE2 receptor on human cells - Covid-19's gateway into the body. Similar viruses have previously only been found in China and Japan, but the presence of this strain in Thailand suggests there are far more than thought and are spread over a 3,000 mile range across Southeast Asia. Lead scientist Dr Supaporn Wacharapluesadee said: ""This is an important discovery in the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2, which was made possible by rapid application of cutting-edge technology through transparent international collaboration.""

Scientists have found a new virus in bats in Thailand

The findings come as World Health Organisation investigators probing the origins of the pandemic said bats remain a likely source and that transmission of the virus via frozen food is a possibility. Peter Ben Embarek, who led the team of independent experts in its nearly month-long visit to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it is believed the outbreak may have first emerged at a seafood market in late 2019, said the team's work had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture. He said: ""Our initial findings suggest that the introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one that will require more studies and more specific targeted research. ""The possible path from whatever original animal species all the way through to the Huanan market could have taken a very long and convoluted path involving also movements across borders.""

The Covid-19 pandemic is thought to have started in Wuhan market

Dr Embarek said work to identify the coronavirus's origins points to a natural reservoir in bats but it is unlikely that they were in Wuhan. He said: ""In trying to understand the picture of December 2019 we embarked on a very detailed and profound search for other cases that may have been missed, cases earlier on in 2019. ""And the conclusion was we did not find evidence of large outbreaks that could be related to cases of Covid-19 prior to December 2019 in Wuhan or elsewhere."" Dr Embarek said the possibility the virus leaked from a lab - which has been the subject of conspiracy theories - was extremely unlikely and did not require further study.

A study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health shows that the median time for symptoms to show up is about five days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have warned of the three main symptoms of the virus to be vigilant of which include a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.

However, public health officials have now listed another nine symptoms which should be added to the list warning of a possible infection.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock issued a thank you to everyone who has already had the coronavirus jab and those administering it during the Monday night coronavirus briefing. Despite the success in the vaccine rollout, he reiterated the importance of maintaining good defence against the virus through preventative measures. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam also addressed the concerns about the South-African variant.

He insisted that there was no need to be concerned that the South African coronavirus variant would overtake or replace the strain the UK is currently dealing with. Professor Van-Tam said: ""The South African variant has been detected in the UK but in very small numbers. ""It is not our dominant virus, our dominant virus at the moment is a variant that was first identified in Kent which you will be aware of. ""You will know, with what we saw before Christmas with the Kent variant, that if it has a distinct transmissibility advantage over the predecessor then it can establish itself very quickly indeed.

Jonathan VanTam: reassured the public that the South African coronavirus strain was not something to be concerned about at this stage in the UK's fight against the disease.

""But early data on the modelling of the South Africa strain does not suggest this is so. ""It does not suggest that the South African variant has a distinct transmissibility advantage over our current virus."" Profess Van-Tam continued to treasure that the South African strain was not the greatest concern currently. He said: ""Because of that, there is no reason to think the South African variant will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months.

Pampered Whitehall mandarins bill taxpayers for thousands of overnight stays at the sumptuous Sunningdale Park hotel complex near Ascot, Berkshire. Despite the economic austerity, they are checking into the resort for lessons at the National School of Government which costs £28million a year to run. They learn how to manage job losses, write speeches for ministers and listen to £2,000-a-head lectures on diversity. When not toiling in the classroom, they enjoy luxuries their lower-paid colleagues can only dream of. Although signs warn visitors of a “heightened” state of vigilance around the Government property, two Sunday Express reporters strolled around the grounds of the neo-Georgian mansion unchecked. There is a croquet lawn, tennis and squash courts and outdoor swimming pool.

This school is a vital tool Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell

Principal Rod Clark was paid £145,000 last year, including a £12,500 bonus. The college’s latest accounts reveal that 73 fellow managers at the school pocketed another £213,000 in bonuses between them. Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell describes the school as a “vital tool” in confronting the “serious challenges” faced by the civil service. However, former students privately admit that securing a stay there is a highlight of their year. One said courses were considered a “doddle” and little more than a “nice away break”. According to the college brochure, its flagship course begins next month. The 18-day “Prime Minister’s Top Management Programme” is for senior civil service managers aspiring to the upper echelons of Whitehall and costs taxpayers £15,950 a head.

When the Sunday Express questioned its value for money last week, the Cabinet Office said that the course’s future was “under review”. A two-day course on “managing reorganisation and redundancy” is listed at £850 a head. The college accounts reveal that last year the cost of hiring external lecturers totalled £6.3million. Last night Bernard Jenkin, Tory chairman of the Commons Public Administration Select Committee, said: “Despite the money being spent by the school over the years, management and implementing skills are clearly still in short supply within the civil service. “This is certainly something that my committee could call in for an inquiry as part of our overall study of the civil service.”",Daily_Express,"['learn', 'tool', 'whitehall', 'sumptuous', 'servants', 'cabinet', 'service', 'sunningdale', 'luxury', 'taxpayers', 'vital', 'savage', 'cuts', 'hotel', 'civil', 'school']",0

The coronavirus pandemic has been a vital threat to humanity for more than a year. Saturday, January 30, officially marked the one year anniversary of the World Health Organization’s official designation of the crisis, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This designation is made when “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action”.

Globally, there have been 104 million cases of coronavirus, of which 2.2m people have died. The UK has the fifth-highest number of cases of any country in the world with a reported 3.8 million cases since the pandemic began. Britain also has the fifth-highest number of Covid-related deaths in the world, with 106,564 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The world is currently in the midst of issuing vaccines to its citizens as new threats such as the new Covid variants emerge. But what happens now?

Coronavirus timeline: The vaccine has now been given to all older residents in England

READ MORE French officials blast Marine Le Pen over coronavirus border row Variations Virologist Professor Martin Michaelis said the new variants are a point of concern. He told Express.co.uk: “The roll-out of vaccines is good news, and more effective drug therapies will become available at some point. “However, the current Covid-19 levels remain very high in many parts of the world. This is of concern because increasing levels of immunity due to vaccination and previous infection start to exert a selection pressure that favours the formation of novel variants that can escape immune recognition. “The recent detection of novel variants in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa illustrates this.” He added: “Since the formation of new variants is a stochastic process driven by random mutations during virus replication, a high number of infected people is associated with a high risk of novel variants that are not covered by vaccines or pre-existing immunity from previous infections. “Hence, current vaccines may need to be adapted prior to the end of this first vaccination campaign. This is possible but will take time. “Therefore, our exit out of this pandemic will not be as smooth as many may have hoped, and restrictions may have to be in place for longer than anticipated.” Lifespan of Covid-19 Christian Stephenson, chief development officer at Medusa 19, the producer of a 15-minute saliva-based lateral flow Covid test, said the crisis is still only in the early stages. Mr Stephenson told Express.co.uk: “We are still early in the vaccination process – the vaccines will still take time to roll out globally, and we are also unsure about the success rate of many of those produced. “Until we have this clarity, a robust testing procedure will be crucial to controlling the virus and keeping the economy moving.”

Coronavirus timeline: There have been 103 million cases around the globe

When asked if the threat of coronavirus will remain with humanity for a long period, Mr Stephenson said it was highly likely to be a consistent problem. He explained: “It is likely that Covid-19 will be with us, in some form or another, for life. “As a comparison, the flu virus continually mutates and therefore requires a yearly vaccine, which is regularly modified. “As we have seen the Covid-19 virus mutate at speed, it is also likely that the vaccine will need repeatedly updating. “This means that we will also need jabs each year, until the point where we are able to develop long-lasting immunity, but this could take years.” Professor Michaelis said there is a “good chance” the developed world will have a handle on the pandemic by the end of the year. He told Express.co.uk: “If we can get the Covid-19 numbers down, we reduce the chance that novel variants emerge. With increased testing, we can identify and contain outbreaks early before sweeping restrictions are needed. “However, we will also learn that Covid-19 is a global problem and that we are not safe as long as the disease is spreading in many areas of the world. Even once we have Covid-19 under control in the UK, we will live with the threat of its reintroduction from other places.” DON'T MISS

Virus 'unlikely' to go Lockdown Mr Stephenson predicts a future involving many more lockdown periods as countries attempt to grapple with the outbreak. He told Express.co.uk: “It is also very likely that we will still experience periods of lockdown in the coming years until we have a better understanding of how the virus mutates and the effect of the vaccine on those mutations. “That said, with a robust system of testing, and the introduction of digital freedom passports, we may be able to find a way to return to some sort of normal life in the short term. “There are certainly indications that 2021 will be very similar to last year. “The key now will be to think wider than this year and next – the virus is likely to stay and we will have to develop a new normal, with testing and continual vaccinations.” Herd immunity Dr Ashley Love a former state epidemiologist of Delaware and public health expert, however, said lockdowns may not be necessary if enough people are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. She told Express.co.uk: “Herd immunity is achieved when we have enough people who have gotten the disease or receive the vaccination. “Of course, the million-dollar question is what percentage of the people have to be vaccinated; it is uncertain due to the mutations. “All viruses can mutate to increase their survival rate to the maximum. “This will be the new normal - wearing masks, hand washing, and physical distancing.”

Vaccination rollout Professor Michaelis warned Britain’s vaccination programme may have to be started from the beginning again if it is not handled correctly. He told Express.co.uk: “This will depend very much on our actions. “If we take one big effort to bring the numbers down to very low levels, something around one case per million residents per day, we will be able to control individual cases of Covid-19 transmission by isolating infected individuals and their contacts without sweeping measures. “If we do not take such a decisive step, progress will be slower and we will have more of a bumpy ride with new variants and smaller and larger flare-ups. “If the numbers remain very high and particularly dangerous new variants emerge, we may have to start our vaccination programmes from scratch.” READ MORE: How effective will national lockdowns prove as new variants appear?

The analysis, undertaken by Houriiyah Tegally, Tulio de Oliveira and colleagues at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, looked at 1,300 near-whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in the country during the first six months of the pandemic. These findings, contained in a paper published in Nature Medicine, shed further light on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout South Africa between March 6 and August 26.

The COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa is the largest in Africa, with more than 785,000 people infected, accounting for roughly 50 percent of all known African infections, and more than 20,000 deaths by the end of November 2020. In their report, the authors write: “Most of these lineages have unique mutations that have not been identified elsewhere. The newly identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, had 16 nucleotide mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence, the report explains, and was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa by the end of August 2020.

In addition, an early South African-specific lineage, B.1.106, identified in April 2020, became extinct after outbreaks were controlled in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The authors added: “Our findings show that genomic surveillance can be implemented on a large scale in Africa to identify new lineages and inform measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. “Such genomic surveillance presented in this study has been shown to be crucial in the identification of the 501Y.V2 variant in South Africa in December 2020.” READ MORE: Brexit victory as EU's mask slips with vaccine row

The coronavirus pandemic has been a vital threat to humanity for more than a year. Saturday, January 30, officially marked the one year anniversary of the World Health Organization’s official designation of the crisis, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This designation is made when “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action”.

Globally, there have been 104 million cases of coronavirus, of which 2.2m people have died. The UK has the fifth-highest number of cases of any country in the world with a reported 3.8 million cases since the pandemic began. Britain also has the fifth-highest number of Covid-related deaths in the world, with 106,564 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

He told Express.co.uk: “The roll-out of vaccines is good news, and more effective drug therapies will become available at some point. “However, the current Covid-19 levels remain very high in many parts of the world. This is of concern because increasing levels of immunity due to vaccination and previous infection start to exert a selection pressure that favours the formation of novel variants that can escape immune recognition. “The recent detection of novel variants in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa illustrates this.” He added: “Since the formation of new variants is a stochastic process driven by random mutations during virus replication, a high number of infected people is associated with a high risk of novel variants that are not covered by vaccines or pre-existing immunity from previous infections. “Hence, current vaccines may need to be adapted prior to the end of this first vaccination campaign.

He told Express.co.uk: “If we can get the Covid-19 numbers down, we reduce the chance that novel variants emerge. With increased testing, we can identify and contain outbreaks early before sweeping restrictions are needed. “However, we will also learn that Covid-19 is a global problem and that we are not safe as long as the disease is spreading in many areas of the world.

Like so many across the country, Michael had his heart stolen by the World War Two veteran following his charity fundraising efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Now the war hero has been diagnosed with COVID-19, Michael shared a touching message of support to the 100-year-old on the first The One Show of the week.

Michael’s words came just a few minutes into Monday’s edition of the BBC magazine show. The singer began: “First, let’s talk about Sir Captain Tom Moore who’s currently in hospital with coronavirus. “Tom and the family, if you’re watching you know we’re all thinking of you,” he continued as he took a deep breath to compose himself. The One Show host continued: “You are such an amazing man who has touched so many lives, including mine, in such a profound way.” READ MORE: Dick Strawbridge opens up on Escape to the Chateau ‘disappointment’

Sir Tom said he set about raising the money, with an original target of £1,000, “for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job”.

He went on to break two Guinness world records – becoming the oldest person to get a No 1 single in the UK charts and raising the most money ever for doing an individual charity walk.

Singer Michael Ball, who recorded the charity single with Sir Tom which reached number one, said the 100-year-old had left the public richer through his inspiring acts.

He told BBC Breakfast: ""Everything that he did, every challenge that he set himself, every accolade, every goal, everything that he achieved, he relished every moment of it.

However, an issue with supply shortages of the jab for the EU has seen the Bloc demand AstraZeneca doses be sent from British plants to make up for a shortfall.

AstraZeneca has said initial deliveries to the EU will fall short because of a production glitch - said to be at a hub in Belgium - and it will not be able to meet its supply targets for the first three months of this year.

With the speed of the UK's vaccine rollout outstripping other European countries, the EU has suggested doses produced in Europe have been directed elsewhere.

The country will soon learn the full impact of the third lockdown, implemented at the end of 2020, but Mr Sunak is already planning ways to pay for the pandemic.

Reports from last November suggest the middle classes will bear the brunt of the bill, with Mr Sunak now set to break a second manifesto pledge from the 2019 general election. He had already announced plans to cut international aid spending from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.5 percent, and the Chancellor could break the promise of no tax hikes. The claims were reported by iNews, who outlined that one measure being considered by the Chancellor was changing VAT zero rates by reducing the number of items that do not incur the tax. James Smith, research director of the left-leaning Resolution Foundation, added: “While the Chancellor was at pains to avoid talk of tax rises, there is widespread consensus that they are coming once the recovery from Covid has been secured – both to repair the public finances and grapple with big non-Covid challenges, such as an ageing population and transitioning to a low carbon economy.”

Rishi Sunak news: Sunak had considered wealth taxes

Tax Research UK's Richard Murphy told Express.co.uk last year that raising taxes to try and recover from the pandemic could spark a ""depression rather than a recession"". He said: ""At first, Rishi Sunak completely underestimated what was going to happen, it was a complete disaster, because he hadn't realised how disastrous coronavirus was going to be. ""But he was back a week later with the furlough scheme, it was smart, quick, some people lost out when they shouldn't have done. ""Now Sunak's obsession with debt is kicking in again. ""If he opts for austerity and tax hikes, then frankly we are heading for depression rather than a recession."" READ MORE: Inheritance tax increase 'on horizon' as expert warns: 'I'm fearful'

Rishi Sunak news: The country is enduring a third lockdown

Reports have previously hinted that Mr Sunak could use wealth taxes to try and recover funds. But Rishi Sunak has rejected the idea, because it would be ""un-Conservative"" and go against Tory values, he said. A report published by the Office of Tax Simplification in November, commissioned by Mr Sunak, suggested rises in capital gains tax which could impact inheritance duties. The Wealth Tax Commission also proposed the five percent levy on housing, pension, business, equity and savings wealth in December, and forecasted that it would raise £260billion. DON'T MISS

Throughout the pandemic, the COVID Symptom Study app has tracked the movements of the virus and collected and analysed data on the symptoms of COVID-19 from millions of users.

The scheme, which has cost almost £50billion so far, was supposed to end last October but was extended until April. But the CBI said the Chancellor must ""act now"" to avoid a “cliff-edge"" of job losses and extend it further.

The plea comes as new figures showed Britain's unemployment rate has soared to its highest level for more than four years with more than 200,000 workers losing their jobs in the three months to November. Official data revealed the unemployment rate reached 5 percent for the first time since early 2016, with the second lockdown ripping through the UK jobs market. As the number of unemployed rose to a five-year high of 1.72 million, redundancies also surged to a new record and the growth in vacancies halved as the second wave of the pandemic struck. Experts said the Government's move to extend the furlough scheme to April has helped cushion the blow, with tax data showing employees on company payrolls rose by 52,000 – or 0.2 percent – between November and December.

Rishi Sunak is being urged to protect jobs

Employment also fell at its slowest pace since March, down 88,000 at 32½ million. But 828,000 workers have now been dropped from UK payrolls since February, before the pandemic hit. Economists warned that there would be further pain to come after the latest lockdown hammers the economy. ""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped – and every job lost is a tragedy,"" Mr Sunak said. ""While the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine, we're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families.""

There were 2.4 million jobs on furlough as of the end of October, down from a peak of 8.9 million in May, but experts said many firms had already let staff go before the scheme was first extended. Business leaders reiterated calls on Mr Sunak to extend support measures with the hospitality industry and the high street facing a desperate plight. On Monday alone, more than 20,000 retail jobs were put at risk after Boohoo announced a deal to buy the Debenhams brand, and rival Asos said it was poised to buy Topshop. Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""It is now crucial that the Job Retention Scheme and other COVID-19 economic support is extended beyond the spring to support employment as restrictions continue.""

A hive-type rash known as urticaria could indicate a COVID-19 infection.

According to experts, noticing a sudden appearance of raised bumps on the skin which come and go quite quickly over hours and are usually very itchy, could indicate an infection.

The rash can involve any part of the body, and often starts with intense itching of the palms or soles and can cause swelling of the lips and eyelids.

These rashes can present quite early on in the infection but can also last a long time afterwards.

Martin Daubney pointed out the irony of the situation given the regular warnings which emerged from the Remainer camp about drug shortages after Britain quit the bloc - pointing out things would be vastly worse if Britain was still a member. Mr Daubney, the former editor of Loaded magazine, took to Twitter after it was revealed Brussels was threatening to block exports of the Oxford/Astrazenca jab, accusing the company of failing to provide an adequate explanation for a huge shortfall of promised doses to member states.

He posted: “For years, Brexiteers called the EU a self-serving protectionist racket. For this, we were called ""little Englanders"" “Now the EU threatens to block COVID vaccine exports - including to Britain. So, Remainers: tell us we were wrong?” In a subsequent conversation with Express.co.uk Mr Daubney said: ""If we were still in the EU, we’d be scrapping it out with all the others to get our fair share, with Germany and France calling the shots.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum: ""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first COVID-19 vaccines. To create a truly global common good. ""And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations."" In theory, EU member states could take AstraZeneca to court for breach of supply contracts if it did not honour its delivery schedule, Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Edgars Rinkevics has confirmed.

Throughout the pandemic, the COVID Symptom Study app has tracked the movements of the virus and collected and analysed data on the symptoms of COVID-19 from millions of users.

Research is ongoing to understand the severity of symptoms and those which are most likely to require hospital treatment.

An analysis of the COVID Symptom Study app data by Claire Steves and Professor Tim Spector at King’s College London in October highlighted two ""strong predictors"" of hospitalisation.

The study focused on data from 4,182 COVID Symptom Study app users who had been consistently logging their health and tested positive for COVID-19 through swab PCR testing.

Fatigue has been reported by roughly 63 percent of research subjects who received the vaccine, while headache and muscle pain have affected about 55 and 38 percent of participants, respectively.

Smaller numbers of participants reported chills, joint pain, or fever following vaccination.

Participants were more likely to report such symptoms following the second dose of the vaccine.

Dr Matthew Heinz said: “[The reaction to the second dose] tends to be a little more of an intense response, which does make sense, considering your immune system has been exposed already.

“It gets hit with another dose of [the vaccine], and it has a sort of quicker and more robust response. That makes a lot of sense immunologically,” he added.

“Of course, we have to continue to monitor going forward.”

The European Commission's spokesman continued to maintain the face-to-face meetings were essential ahead of Portugal's presidency of the European Council, insisting it was Portugal who had sent the invitation and that most Brussels business was being conducted online. He said: “As to whether it was a good idea in hindsight to go on the mission or not: what I can say is that of course these decisions are not taken lightly. “The president reflected on this, but it is considered an essential mission because it is a launch of an extremely important presidency.” READ MORE: Brexit LIVE: Boris tells EU to ratify trade deal by February 28

Researchers at The Ohio State University (OSU) Wexner Medical Centre and College of Medicine have spotted two variants of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, in the state. One has been dubbed the “Columbus strain” after it was found in the city last year, and carries three mutations unique to the variant.

Trending

The “Columbus strain” has become the dominant variant of COVID-19 in the state after it emerged in the city in the weeks between December and January.

Dr Dan Jones, vice chair of the division of molecular pathology at OSU who led the study, issued a statement on the variant stating it is unclear how it emerged. He said: “This new Columbus strain has the same genetic backbone as earlier cases we've studied, but these three mutations represent a significant evolution. “We know this shift didn't come from the UK or South African branches of the virus.""

In each case, the arrangement sidesteps the EU, prompting significant consternation within the bloc.

Speaking yesterday, Krzysztof Szczerski, chief of staff to President Duda of Poland, offered a clear hint that countries may adopt a similar approach to Germany while criticising what he called the “disloyalty of individual states”. He said: “Poland should consider individual discussions with suppliers if the European vaccine purchasing system completely fails.”

It is selfish behaviour to buy medicine by yourself, disrespecting common decisions Witold Waszczykowski

However, Germany has ordered 50 million doses from two suppliers - Pfizer and CureVac, as well as buying up another 26 million doses which have been turned down by other countries. In each case, the arrangement sidesteps the EU, prompting significant consternation within the bloc. Witold Waszczykowski, Poland’s former foreign minister, who is now an MEP for the ruling Law and Justice party, said: “It is selfish behaviour to buy medicine by yourself, disrespecting common decisions.

“It is another example of the German policy of respecting their own interests above the interests of other EU countries.” Frederique Ries, a Belgian MEP on the European parliament’s public health committee, had no problem with Germany buying the unused allowances of other countries - but called its deal with Pfizer “worrisome”, saying it showed “a total lack of solidarity”. Mr Forman told Express.co.uk: “The EU adjusted its state rules in March of this year to allow the EU to fund pharmaceutical companies in the development of the vaccine.

""Germany was within its rights to do it but it is interesting that they change the rules as they see fit, when they see fit to allow whatever they were not previously allowing. But that is quite typical of the EU. ""There is clearly a problem in that Germany obviously feels the EU isn’t working fast enough and they want to go out and do their own thing. ""The interesting thing will be how keen the EU will be to accept the British one, the Oxford vaccine.”

Frederique Ries, a Belgian MEP, also criticised Germany

Mr Forman said Germany’s actions underlined the point that when push came to shove, each member state looked after its own interests first, just as had happened at the start of the pandemic when countries opted to close their borders in contravention of the EU’s free movement rules. Speaking yesterday, Krzysztof Szczerski, chief of staff to President Duda of Poland, offered a clear hint that countries may adopt a similar approach to Germany while criticising what he called the “disloyalty of individual states”. He said: “Poland should consider individual discussions with suppliers if the European vaccine purchasing system completely fails.”

Coronavirus vaccines in development

Germany will not take delivery of the extra vaccine doses until all the others have been delivered across the EU. A German health ministry spokesman said: “It’s not correct to say that Germany secured vaccines at the expense of other countries.” The European Commission hopes to wrap up preliminary talks with French company Valneva over the advance purchase of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, EU top negotiator Sandra Gallina said today.

Vaccine rollout has started in the UK, and some 2.6 million doses of the vaccine have now been given to 2.3 million people, according to Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Mr Hancock said last week 200,000 people are receiving their Covid vaccinations every day in the UK.

Mr Hancock also said the Government is on track to hit its target of vaccinating 13 million people against coronavirus by mid-February.

The approval of the Oxford vaccine last year was significant to the UK vaccine rollout programme, as the UK has ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine.

Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored in -70C conditions to reach maximum efficacy, the Oxford vaccine can be kept at temperatures of 2C to 8C.

The Oxford vaccine is easier to roll out to patients in care homes, as it can be kept in similar conventional fridge settings for up to six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.

Sources at Buckingham Palace announced the jabs were administered by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. It makes the couple among 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of the jab so far.

Trending

The Queen's decision to go public with the vaccine update, will no doubt please the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who - in a bid to ease public concern over the jab - said he would take a dose of drug last year. It is highly unusual for the Queen - or other members of Buckingham Palace - to discuss their health. This was particularly clear with Prince Philip, where updates on his health have been limited over the last years. Today's announcement to sway public opinion echoed a similar time when the Queen herself confirmed two of her children would be given the vaccine for the highly controversial polio jab during the Fifties.

In that decade, concern surrounding the polio vaccine gripped Britain. It emerged after some children who had been given the drug actually contracted the disease. Others sadly perished in the US. When the drug was rolled out in the UK, the Queen showed her confidence in the vaccine by confirming her two children had received the jab. At the time, it was reported in the Daily Mail that Prince Charles and Princess Anne - then aged eight and six - had been given two injections by Harley Street specialist Dr Wilfrid Percy Henry Sheldon.

Speaking on Sky News, the channel's royal expert Rhiannon Mills explained the Queen's decision today was ""fascinating and significant"". She said: ""It's incredibly unusual. Usually when it comes to medical matters the Palace, normally, say to us [the media] no comment, and certainly ever since we knew the vaccine was here in the UK, the Palace has said this was a private matter when the couple receive the vaccination.""

""At the time, that was to try and allay any public concerns about the potential side effects of that vaccine. ""So I think today is a very powerful message, of the Queen saying, 'Yes I've had the vaccine... yes, my 99-year-old husband has had the vaccine.'""

Tony Blair was caught in a similar situation

The Queen's decision was also revisited after worries began surrounding the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. While Tony Blair was Prime Minister, growing calls for him to confirm he had given his son Leo the vaccine grew in 2001, and although insiders suggested the youngster had received it no official announcement was made. The major concern over that jab was its possible links to autism and bowel disease, and during the early part of the decade less and less children were receiving the vaccine. Mr Blair, and his wife Cherie, reportedly confirmed they ""entirely supported"" the jab, but stopped short of confirming if their then-19-month-old baby had been given it.

He said: “The evidence that has been collated strongly suggests that the current second wave we are experiencing is being driven by this new variant.”

The news follows President Donald Trump signing a £1.7trillion ($2.3trillion) Covid-19 emergency relief bill last week.

The bill was primarily aimed at providing financial support to those affected by the coronavirus pandemic but a number of unrelated laws have made their way into the 5,600-page document.

Among them is a law calling on the US's intelligence services to present the US Senate intelligence committee with a report on UFOs in 180 days.

According to the bill, the report must include a ""detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomenon data and intelligence reporting collected or held"" by the country's intelligence agencies.

The report must also identify ""any incidents or patterns that indicate a potential adversary may have achieved breakthrough aerospace capabilities that could put United States strategic or conventional forces at risk.""

Tougher measures are the only way to save lives says STEPHEN POLLARD

The Covid cock-ups, over issues which frankly would have been obvious to a child, have been legion. Some are so mind-meltingly stupid, and lethal of course, they bear repeating:

Like Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance telling us last May testing people coming into the country was pointless – so we didn't. Listen to social media for any length of time and you'll quickly find claims the latest super-strain of Covid entered Britain via an illegal migrant. Outrageous? Proabably. But frankly, who knows? Certainly not the so-called experts. We now test everyone arriving in the UK of course.

Like those masks, with Government experts initially telling us not to bother because they didn't work - before making them mandatory of course.

Like Mr Vallance's early notion we might allow the virus to live a little in the interests of herd immunity, as aired on Radio 4's Today programme on March 13. A now seemingly discredited idea – not least by himself.

And like of course Boris telling our kids “you're all going back to school tomorrow!” on Sunday morning. By Monday tea-time he had ever so slightly modified that basically saying “when I said tomorrow, I meant you won't be seeing your classmates until March. At the earliest.”

Whatever faith the British rank and file ever had in the system, or indeed in Government, has visibly dissolved because of this catalogue of cock-ups.

Boris knows this and that is why he inserted the dark line about police enforcement of this unprecedented clampdown on British freedom.

So where do we go from here? Bewilderingly eight out of 10 Brits still support the tougher lockdown – a true triumph of hope over experience.

Boris, and perhaps all of us, are pinning our hopes on the vaccines which the Prime Minister has, to be fair, got ahead of the game on.

As the world edges closer to a year anniversary of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists are still learning about the mysterious disease. The latest study shows that Covid-19 is not directly responsible for brain damage. However, experts who studied the brains of dead patients who had a positive Covid-19 diagnosis saw that the disease can affect the brain.

The coronavirus is predominantly a respiratory disease, yet sufferers often report headaches, delirium, cognitive dysfunction, dizziness, fatigue, and loss of the sense of smell - all signs of neurological problems. The disease could also increase the likelihood of having a stroke. Experts from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted an in-depth examination of 19 people who had died from the coronavirus between March and July 2020 to analyse how the disease can impact the brain. The researchers found that while Covid-19 does not directly impact the brain, the toll it takes on the immune system can lead to damage in the brain.

Covid-19 latest: Coronavirus not directly responsible for brain damage, study shows

COVID-19 is not directly responsible for brain damage

It had been suspected that the damage to the brain was caused by a lack of oxygen, as would be typical of a respiratory disease, however this was not the case. In all of the brain samples which were analysed, the scientists discovered hallmarks of damage caused by thinning and leaky brain blood vessels. The researchers used a high-powered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is up to 10 times more sensitive than a normal MRI scanner to examine the olfactory bulbs and brainstems from each patient. Olfactory bulbs are responsible for our sense of smell, while the brainstem controls our heart rate and breathing. READ MORE: Chris Whitty issues warning despite Covid vaccine rollout

Countries best prepared for an epidemic

The scans revealed that both parts of the brain were dotted with bright spots, called hyperintensities - which are a sign of inflammation, and dark spots - and hypointensities, that represent bleeding. Analysis then revealed that the bright spots contained blood vessels that were thinner than normal and sometimes leaking blood proteins. The scans also showed no signs of the disease in the brain, according to the research published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr Avindra Nath, clinical director at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study, said: ""We found that the brains of patients who contract infection from SARS-CoV-2 may be susceptible to microvascular blood vessel damage. ""Our results suggest that this may be caused by the body's inflammatory response to the virus. DON'T MISS

She said it was ""undoubtedly"" driving the severity of the situation. Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said Scotland will effectively be placed in lockdown for January with a legal requirement to stay at home.

She added: ""As a result of this new variant, (the virus) has just learned to run much faster, and has most definitely picked up pace in the past couple of weeks. ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.""

From Tuesday, Scots would be legally required to stay at home in a move that mirrors the lockdown put in place in March, Ms Sturgeon said.

However, while the companies have committed to supplying the US with 200 million doses by the end of July of this year, the EU's first 200 million are only expected by September, with no guarantee that the order will arrive in full until the end of 2021. Christian Social Union (CSU) leader Mr Soder, seen by many as the man most likely to replace Angela Merkel when she steps down this year, told Bild am Sonntag: ""Obviously, the European purchasing procedure was inadequate.

The Government must end its bitty, piecemeal approach and act decisively Jon Richards

But while the London move has been welcomed as the ""right decision"", the Government was also accused of making another U-turn just days after it told some schools to reopen for the new term. And unions are now calling for all schools in England to remain closed amid the rapid spread of the new covid-19 variant. Unison head of education Jon Richards said: ""The Government must end its bitty, piecemeal approach and act decisively by delaying the start of term for all schools by two weeks because of spiralling infection rates. ""Unison has been calling for this 'circuit-break' since well before Christmas. ""Ministers should also ensure any moves to extend the vaccine priority list must cover all school staff and not just teachers.""

Should schools re-open next week?

Tom Prestwich, a head teacher of a primary school in south London, said he learned about the change in policy on Twitter yesterday afternoon. He said: ""We'd actually just sent a letter out to parents saying that we were still opening next week, and then after that the story broke pretty much straight away. ""I was half expecting some kind of change of policy but by the time it gets to 5pm on a Bank Holiday Friday, you kind of think they might have stuck with a decision, although I am glad that they've changed this one.""

He said the timing was ""really frustrating"" and added: ""We appreciate it's a fast-moving situation, the Government must be getting different health advice all of the time, but schools do need to plan. ""We will be opening for quite a few pupils next week, we'll need two rotas of staff, one to deliver to vulnerable pupils, pupils without decent internet access, pupils with special educational needs, and another to deliver high-quality online learning. ""All of that takes time and this decision could have been made two weeks ago.""

There are growing calls for all schools to delay the start of the new term

The Government has also been criticised over its plans to run mass asymptomatic testing in secondary schools. Test supplies are due to be delivered to schools on Monday, with education union leaders estimating a secondary school with 1,000 pupils will need approximately 21 trained volunteers to carry it out. Dave Lee-Allan, the head teacher of Stowmarket High School in Suffolk, said the rollout has been ""frustrating"", and that it would take at least a week for his school to be operational. He outlined problems with space in the school building, as well as training and vetting the volunteers that have come forward to help.

He said: ""Senior leaders in the school have now got a huge extra weight and challenge given to them as to how we operate this and this, I have to say, has been utterly chaotic, that's the headline being used today, this whole process.""

Earlier this month, rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 jab began in the UK, with over 600,000 doses administered so far. Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old UK grandmother, became the first person in the world to receive the jab under mass vaccination.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the first jabs marked “the start of a fightback against our common enemy: the coronavirus”. However, experts have stressed it is not known whether the jab will prevent virus transmission, with one warning the vaccine on its own may not be enough to fully restore normality. There is also uncertainty surrounding how long any immunity granted by the vaccine will last, according to Dr Martin Michaelis, Professor of Molecular Medicine at the University of Kent’s Industrial Biotechnology Centre.

The UK's vaccine rollout began earlier this month

He told Express.co.uk: “Depending on the level of long-term protection and the virus behaviour, it is well possible that we will need yearly COVID-19 vaccination programmes in the future. “It is not clear how long vaccine-induced immunity will last and if new virus strains that will escape the vaccine-induced immune response will emerge. “Vaccines are important, but on their own they may not be enough to get us to some sort of normal. However, they will enable us to bring the case numbers down.” READ: Coronavirus crisis: Hospitals in south of England OVER CAPACITY – patients to Yorkshire

He added it is “difficult” to say exactly when Covid-19 will be under the same degree of control in the UK as it is in countries like Taiwan.

Meanwhile advisory group Independent SAGE has outlined four key steps the Government must take immediately to get control of the situation. Matt Hancock confirmed the new strain, thought to have emerged in South Africa - of which two cases have been identified so far in the UK - at a press briefing yesterday during which he described the news as ""highly concerning"".

The development further complicates an already difficult situation in the UK, with cases spiking as a result of another new strain which had been discovered previously, which is believed to have originated in Kent, and which is likewise significantly more infectious than the original virus. Professor Gabriel Scally, a Northern Irish public health physician and a former regional director of public health (RDPH) for the south-west of England, told Express.co.uk the Government had been left with little choice but to roll out tougher restrictions. He told Express.co.uk: ""They needed to do something anyway and concerns about a new variant and its infectivity probably runs alongside that rather than causing the changes, because we were not doing well. ""The Government has been warned about the numbers going wrong for weeks and weeks.

Dr Gabriel Scally suggested the Tier 4 updates were inevitable

""The fact is that Tier 3 was not really working in most of the Tier 3 areas, so it was almost inevitable. ""One of the reasons that these variants, or any variant, is gaining a toehold in the UK is that we have got so much of the virus. ""When you have got 39,000 cases a day, it is just incredible. ""There is plenty of opportunity for any virus to spread, clearly."" JUST IN: Farage praises Boris and hopes Brexit is ‘beginning of end for EU’

Addressing the ""rapidly worsening"" situation in the UK, especially in England and Wales, an Independent SAGE spokesman said: ""Evidence is now strong that the new variant of COVID-19 (B117) is significantly more infectious than previous strains. This is making a bad situation worse. ""Cases in all tiers are rising, even where the variant is still rare. As Matt Hancock announced on 23 December, Tiers 1-3 are not able to contain the spread of the new variant. ""Dr Jenny Harries confirmed that the new variant is also present across the UK and its dominance is spreading outwards rapidly from the South East across England."" Modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated that the first new variant would account for 90 percent of new cases by mid-January, the spokesman explained. DON'T MISS

He added: ""Christmas Day mixing of households indoors for prolonged periods of time, as allowed in tiers 1 to 3 in England and across the devolved nations, sets the scene for thousands of super-spreading events. ""In the context of the new strain, this is incredibly dangerous. ""The new variant requires a complete rethink of all mitigation strategies.""

Chris Whitty says new COVID-19 strain can spread ‘more quickly’

Independent SAGE is calling on the Government to: Rescind a relaxation of the rules and ban household mixing on Christmas Day (apart from exemptions and pre-existing bubbles) Place all regions of England in Tier 4 to suppress spread of the virus as far as possible while scientists continue to learn more about it. The devolved nations should bring forward their own national lockdowns from Boxing Day to 24th December. Tier 4 should include enhanced travel restrictions. Put in place an emergency plan to enable safe education in January and February. Focus all efforts on mass roll-out of vaccination.

Hospitals where the coronavirus vaccine will be administered

Speaking separately, Professor Amesh Adalja, Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Express.co.uk: ""It’s important to remember that all viruses mutate and we are going to find new variance of the novel coronavirus when we look systematically the way they are doing in certain countries. ""It is important to remember though, that most mutations are not going to have any significance. It appears a South African variant has some mutations that are associated with the possibility of easier spread and it is becoming more prevalent there. ""This - and all variants - spread from person to person in the same way (primary respiratory droplets) so the common sense precautions of wearing a face covering, washing your hands, doing things outdoors, and avoiding crowded places will be effective.

The Government is taking action after the emergence of a new, more contagious coronavirus strain, which most likely originated in Kent - and to complicate matters still further, Mr Hancock also announced details of a third variant which had been identified in South Africa . He told a press briefing: ""We have discovered a new more contagious variant which is spreading at a dangerous rate. I know the vast majority of people understand what we need to do to get through this.

He added: ""From 00.01 on Boxing Day Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, those parts of Essex not yet in Tier 4, Waverley in Surrey and Hampshire including Portsmouth and Southampton but with the exception of the New Forest will all be escalated to Tier 4.

""Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset including the North Somerset council area, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northamptonshire as well as Chesire and Warrington will all be escalated to Tier 3.

""And I'm afraid that Cornwall and Herefordshire have seen sharply rising rates and need to be escalated to Tier 2.""

Mr Hancock also revealed the discovery of a third strain, explaining: ""We are incredibly grateful to the South African government for the rigour of their science and the openness and the transparency with which they have rightly acted as we did when we discovered a new variant here.""

He added: ""This new variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK.""

Warning of a difficult start to 2021, Mr Hancock added: ""I know these decisions are tough but I believe everybody will do what is needed to keep themselves and others safe especially this Christmas.""

2020-12-21 10:32:40+00:00,4,"Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Dr Chris Smith warned those who have already been infected with coronavirus can catch the new mutated strain circulating in the UK in a matter of days from recovering. The virologist explained immunity to the deadly disease could be very short-lived as he urged people to continue to comply with strict social distancing measures. He said: ""As far as we know, you should regard yourself whether you've had coronavirus in the past or not, as potentially susceptible to coronavirus.

""Because although with most viruses when you've encountered them and your bodies has made an immune response and you can regard yourself as immune, for some viruses - coronaviruses included - the immunity you get from that infection can be very short-lived.

""And indeed there are a number of case reports out there now of people who definitely caught coronavirus and a short time later - indeed one case report I've seen within 48 days of recovering from coronavirus, a person caught it again.

""So the immunity can be short-lived, and the immunity not just for one strain but the immunity potentially for all the different variants of the coronavirus that exist can be short-lived.

""So, until you've had the vaccine, which is the best prospect of being protected for a really long time - we think - you should regard yourself as potentially susceptible to any strain, whether or not you've had it.

Some of these are known up front, for example the application to the courts for the grant for probate - £215 for estates over £5,000 after debts have been paid, or copies of a death certificate, worth £11 each time.

“But some costs only become clear once the process starts, for example, the cost of searching for financial assets via an asset search firm, which can be £200 to £300.

2020-12-19 22:17:12+00:00,3,"Boris Johnson announces Tier 4 restrictions for parts of UK

Boris Johnson yesterday said he was “bitterly disappointed” to axe festivities and create a tough new Tier 4 area for most of the south east of England. No one in those areas can visit other households to celebrate, essentially wrecking Christmas for more than 16 million people. The rest of Britain will see their relaxed indoor mixing rules cut from a proposed five days down to just Christmas Day. The Prime Minister said he had to act after the new strain of the virus, which first emerged in Kent in September, took hold and was proving to be up to 70 per cent more infectious. Just last week, Mr Johnson had refused to alter plans for five days of household mixing, saying: “I don’t want to ban or cancel Christmas. I think, frankly, that would be inhuman.” But yesterday these plans were scrapped. Wales and Scotland also introduced tough new measures. The Prime Minister had appeared at a gloomy press conference with chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.

Mr Johnson said: “We cannot continue with Christmas as planned. Christmas will be different but we must be realistic. “As sure as night follows day we will beat back this virus and reclaim our lives. “We are sacrificing the chance of seeing our loved ones this Christmas so we have a better chance to see them for future Christmases. “When the virus changes its method of attack, we have to change our method of defence.” The crackdown came as figures ­published yesterday confirmed a further 534 deaths, up on Friday’s 489, and 27,052 new cases, down from 28,507. According to scientists, the new variant has increased infections by 70 per cent and was responsible for the rate continuing to rise in Kent during the second lockdown. Professor Whitty said that it was in two other countries but most prevalent in Britain and that he had reported it officially to the World Health Organisation. He admitted that “this is a bad moment” but “it is not the worst moment”. And he said that the “light at the end of the tunnel” – with the vaccine being rolled out along with better treatments – means “this is not the worst moment in this pandemic”. The new rules will mean that, as of today, a stay-at-home order will be imposed in London, Kent, most of Essex and Surrey and large parts of Hampshire, with only essential shops being allowed to open. This crackdown will affect 16.4 million people. There are 19.7 million in Tier 3, 16.1 million in Tier 2, and 856,000 in Tier 1. Nobody in Tier 4 areas can get together with other households to celebrate Christmas, while those in tiers 1 to 3 will only be able to do it on Christmas Day instead of the five days originally promised. The PM’s announcement was quickly followed by one from Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said he would put the whole of Wales in Tier 4. However, he has allowed people to meet up in two household ­bubbles on Christmas Day. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will put the country into level four restrictions from Boxing Day. Planned relaxation of the measures has been cut to Christmas Day alone.

Boris Johnson made the announcement this afternoon

Ms Sturgeon insisted that the decision had made her “want to cry” but said this was the most dangerous moment. The decision by Mr Johnson and his team of experts has been met with dismay by many Tory MPs. They privately believe that a decision to cancel Christmas was delayed until after MPs were no longer sitting in the Commons, so they would be unable to scrutinise the decision. A review of the new tiers will take place on December 30 but government sources have hinted that they are expected to continue. It is believed that the Prime Minister is still determined that pupils in Tier 4 areas return to schools next month. Mr Johnson knows that he is facing an increasing chance of a rebellion on his backbenches. He was saved in the vote on the tier system earlier this month because Labour chose to abstain and ministers had promised to take many constituencies in Tier 3 and put them in Tier 2 at the first review. Despite this, the Government still had more than 50 Conservative MPs rebel.

Boris Johnson said the restrictions will be reviewed on December 30

The chairman of the Covid Research Group, MP Mark Harper, voiced the opinions of many colleagues when he warned lockdowns and tiers “have failed”. Reacting to yesterday’s ann­­ouncement, he said: “This is a very sad day. Lockdowns and increasingly severe tiered restrictions have failed in their goal of slowing the transmission of Covid. “And now the Government is expecting people to sacrifice the chance to share Christmas with family, friends and loved ones –just a few days after promising the opposite. “If the Government wants the support of the public and Parliament, it must publish a clear exit strategy from this night­marish cycle of damaging lockdowns and restrictions.

His development is one of many vaccines in the works to stop the spread of coronavirus. Currently, more than 137,000 people in the UK have received the first dose of the first approved Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.

Kate then voiced people’s concerns about how speedy the vaccines had been developed. She asked: “How can we feel confident that not just at the time where we’re immunised, but in months, years and decades down the road, there won’t be some sort of comeback from having the vaccine with it being brought to the table so quickly?” Professor Shatttock said he understood people’s safety concerns because of the speed of development, but highlighted there had been tens of thousands of participants who had trialled the vaccine.

Professor Robin Shattock said the vaccines had been a 'great success story so far'

“That’s the same number of people you’d study on over a period of five years,” he emphasised. “There hasn’t been less scrutiny of the vaccines, it’s just been done in a faster period.” He added: “And people need to understand that most side effects, serious side effects, occur between the weeks or months of getting the vaccination, so 20/30 thousand people have been studied for each individual vaccine, we know that there has been no serious consequences of the vaccine in that period of time.” Shattock went on to say it was, however, impossible to rule out somebody having serious side effects as the number of those receiving the vaccine increases.

But, he explained this was more likely to happen to somebody who had an underlying health issue. “It’s about a risk benefit ratio,” he added on the Royal Society of Medicine’s YouTube channel. “No medicine is without any risk at all but the risk of contracting Covid-19 and having a serious consequence of that, is so much higher than any potential risk from a vaccine. “In ways, it’s a fairly easy judgement in my mind.” Kate put forward questions to the expert in the midst of her husband’s health battle.",Daily_Express,"['kate', 'shattock', 'covid', 'vaccine', 'garraway', 'voices', 'coronavirus', 'peoples', 'concerns', 'covid19', 'professor', 'battle', 'husbands', 'serious', 'vaccines', 'development', 'health', 'robin', 'risk']",0

Experts believe the increased prevalence in the two regions - which has seen the capital, and large parts of Essex put into Tier 3 in recent days - may be linked to key mutations detected in the strain. Professor Nick Loman, from the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, a member of the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium (COG-UK) said: ""There is actually 17 changes that would affect the protein structure in some way that distinguish this variant from its kind of common ancestor of other variants that are circulating, which is a lot.

""It’s striking. There’s a really long branch going back to the common ancestor, and it’s a matter of great interest as to why that is the case. ""Intriguingly, there no indication the strain had evolved in another country and arrived in the UK, Prof Loman said, admitting: ""It’s sort of come out of nowhere. ""We have a long gap between the first cases we saw with this variant in late September.

""It’s more likely to have evolved in the UK but we don’t know that. ""There are very few examples of this variant in other countries at the moment – it’s really a kind of UK phenomenon."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock mentioned the new strain in the House of Commons this week.

In a statement issued yesterday, COG-UK said: ""Efforts are under way to confirm whether or not any of these mutations are contributing to increased transmission. ""There is currently no evidence that this variant (or any other studied to date) has any impact on disease severity, or that it will render vaccines less effective, although both questions require further studies performed at pace. ""We will provide further updates as our investigations proceed.""

The statement added: ""COG-UK has developed a Summary Mutation Report, which will be released online each week as a companion to the Coverage Report. ""The first prototype will be released by 18th December, with improvements made over time. ""This will focus on mutations that are common, and/or are of existing or emerging interest.

2020-12-14 17:20:00+00:00,2,"A total eclipse of the Sun is a rare event enjoyed by select parts of the world every 18 months or so. Today (December 14) the Moon has crossed paths with the Sun over parts of the Pacific and South America for the first total eclipse since July 2019. And although most will not get to see the eclipse in person, Express.co.uk explains how you can see the event unfold from the comfort of your home.

The Moon might be about 400 times smaller than the Sun but when viewed from Earth, the two appear to be roughly the same size.

As a result, the Moon can blot out the Sun from sight during a total or partial eclipse.

Today, the Moon has covered the Sun for minutes at a time over parts of the Southern Hemisphere, casting a shadow directly onto the planet's surface.

Unfortunately, the shadow is relatively small and the eclipse is only visible across a very narrow stretch of Chile and Argentina in South America.

Locations to the north and south of this stretch will also get to see a partial eclipse of the Sun.

Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the jab developed by Pfizer and BioNTech while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has yet to do so for the EU.

I'm not convinced if they'd been part of that European buying programme they'd have had the flexibility Hugo Fry

And Mr Fry said Britain's MHRA had set a precedent by assessing the vaccine on an emergency basis and completing several months' work in just a few weeks. He said: ""It's a good example of what they can do when they put their mind to it. ""There is no doubt whatsoever that the UK has one of the most respected and best regulatory agencies for medicines in the world. ""This shows that if you sit down with the MHRA and discuss the pathway and a potential rapid agreement going forward, it can potentially bring really good innovative medicines very quickly to UK patients.""

Britain has approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine

Mr Fry, who opposed Brexit, also praised the UK Vaccines Taskforce which has secured access to 357 million doses of vaccines from seven different manufacturers. He told the Telegraph: ""They've been fast and they got a really nice selection and they got good volumes. ""I'm not convinced that if they'd been part of that European buying programme they'd have had quite the speed and the flexibility to do it.

But Britain's success story has not be so warmly welcomed elsewhere in Europe with the EMA accusing the UK of sacrificing rigour in the interests of speed and Health Secretary Matt Hancock facing a backlash after claiming Brexit helped Britain achieve the vaccine breakthrough. Mr Hancock said the Europeans were ""moving a little bit more slowly"" but insisted the vaccine had gone through the necessary safety checks to allow the UK to approve it. MHRA chief June Raine said the approval was made using provisions under European law, which still binds the UK until the end of the year. But German MEP Pieter Liese, a member of the European Parliament's public health committee, said individual EU member states could have authorised the vaccine but had chosen to wait for the EMA to examine more information rather than follow the ""hasty"" UK example.

Dr Liese - a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party - said: ""I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU member states do not repeat the process in the same way. ""A few weeks of thorough examination by the EMA is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine."" He suggested that the move could have been influenced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's domestic difficulties. He said: ""Britain now has nearly 60,000 corona deaths. Add to this the fact that Britain is an island and has never been a Schengen member, which means open borders in Europe.

The Government suggested these could be used to allow each care home resident to receive two visits a week, though protective clothing will still need to be worn. Tests were sent out to care homes across England at the end of last week and over the weekend. However this was done by the national Government, allegedly bypassing local authorities, sparking concerns about whether the expertise to conduct the tests properly is in place. Speaking to Manchester Evening News Bolton Conservative councillor Andy Morgan, who also runs care homes as a business, urged caution until more details are provided.

""We're telling them to carry on doing what they were doing""

He said: “Only when we are confident that the appropriate guidance and safety measures are in place will we announce when it is appropriate to allow close contact visiting. “I won’t sanction or ask any care home to do anything that I don’t think is safe in my own care home. “We’re telling them to carry on doing what they were doing.” Councillor Morgan estimated it would take one and a half hours of work from a care home employee for each visitor, covering administering the test and supervising the visit.

On Wednesday the UK authorised the use of the new Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, becoming the first major western country to do so. Vaccinations are expected to begin next week, though only a small proportion of people are forecast to receive the vaccine before next spring. Bolton Council wrote to care homes advising them to wait for additional clarification before using the tests. They said: “We understand that the correct administration of the tests by trained individuals increases the effectiveness and reduces risk of false negatives.

""There is some concern about the way this is being handled""

The UK has recorded more coronavirus cases than any other European countries

“To ensure that we have the safest and most effective testing, we will seek clarity to your queries before we ask you to start the roll out of testing using the lateral flow kits in your homes.” Many care home residents haven’t received an external visitor since the coronavirus pandemic began in March. Covid-19 is particularly dangerous to the elderly and caused many deaths when it spread through UK care homes. The Government hopes the new tests will allow visiting to once again resume safely.

Speaking to Manchester Evening News mayor Andy Burnham also raised his concerns. He commented: “There is some concern about the way this is being handled. “Tests have been sent to every home in Greater Manchester - indeed in the country I think - in recent days by the government and there is some considerable confusion out there and concern about how care homes will actually get the trained staff in place and how they will actually fund the delivery of these tests. “I think there’s a front page headline, national newspaper headline, today promising the public that this is all about to start and all about to happen.

2022-02-26 09:56:07+00:00,2,"When an individual thinks of the long-term impact of COVID-19, what do they think of? They may think of the economic devastation, the large death toll, or the growing number of people with long-Covid. While all of these are in their own ways impressive, devastating, and tragic, they sadly do not provide the full picture of what is coming over the horizon. Express.co.uk recently talked to Dr Ziyad-Aly, one of the lead authors behind an explosive report that shows the long-term impact of COVID-19 could be much larger than originally thought.

The report, published in the journal Nature Medicine, shows that those who have had even a mild form of Covid are much more likely to develop heart related conditions.

Dr Aly said: “What we found is that people with COVID-19 across the board had a much higher risk of cardiovascular problems and that included strokes and TIAs including abnormal heart rhythms.”

What makes the results of the report so important is that the risk of heart conditions and heart failure was evident across all groups regardless of age, sex, gender, ethnicity, and regardless of whether not they had any cardiovascular risk factors.

Dr Aly added that the impact of this was significant: “[B]ecause of the enormity of it and the large number of people affected with Covid and subsequently large number of people affected with cardiovascular disease, that’s going to pose a serious challenge on already strained health systems like the NHS and health systems in the US.”

As a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the 71-year-old Royal is “disappointed” she won't be able to attend or sit in on committee meetings in the lead-up, the Palace announced. In a statement, Buckingham Palace revealed: “The Princess Royal is disappointed she will not be able to attend the IOC meetings in Beijing ahead of the winter Olympics this year, nor the Games themselves.

“This is due to the flight and COVID travel restriction difficulties in getting to and from the Games without losing too much of her busy work schedule at home. “Her Royal Highness sends her best wishes for the Games to the British athletes and supporting officials.” However, the Telegraph notes that the Princess Royal's inability to attend the games in the Chinese capital happens to fall in line with calls by Prime Minister Boris Johnson of a “diplomatic boycott” of the event. In December, Mr Johnson said the UK would not hesitate in boycotting the upcoming event, to make a stand against China's recent human rights violations.

But he denied the health service lacked the manpower to cope with the crisis.

In his most outspoken attack yet against Covid deniers, the Prime Minister said: ""I want to say to the anti-vax campaigners, the people who are putting this mumbo jumbo on social media: they are completely wrong. ""You haven't heard me say that before, because it's important we have a voluntary approach in this country and we're going to keep a voluntary approach."" He contrasted that approach to immunisation with the ""coercion"" in other European countries such as Austria and Italy which are introducing compulsory jabs. He added: ""What a tragedy that we've got all this pressure on the NHS, all the difficulties that our doctors and nurses are experiencing and we've got people out there spouting complete nonsense about vaccination. Ambulance queues and, ""They are totally wrong, and I think it's time that I, the Government, call them out on what they're doing. It's absolutely wrong, it's totally counterproductive, and the stuff they're putting out on social media is complete mumbo jumbo."" During a visit to a vaccination centre in Moulton Park, Northampton, the PM acknowledged the NHS was under pressure with growing numbers of patients being admitted to hospitals after catching the Omicron variant.

But he denied claims the service did not have enough staff to handle the crisis. He said: ""I appreciate that the NHS is under huge pressure and it's been continuous over the last 18 months - we've had wave after wave of Covid and our NHS has responded magnificently and kept going. ""And of course I understand how frustrating it is to see another wave coming in, and I thank doctors, nurses, all health staff, everybody, for what they're doing to keep going."" Staff numbers had increased and were being boosted by retired staff returning to help out along with thousands of volunteers, Mr Johnson said. And he insisted Omicron was milder than previous variants. He said: ""The pressures on hospitals are clear. What we've got to do is give the NHS all the help we can through the next period, with all the simplifications of systems, moving staff from one hospital to another. ""These are all the ways we can back staff up, but also make sure that the people who are likely to get ill get vaccinated first.

Yet fewer than half of all adults in some above, Faye's tweet of the biggest cities in England are among those to get a top-up jab. Downing Street officials yesterday defended the Government's moves to consider revising the official definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include only those who have had a two initial vaccine doses and a booster jab - three in total.

The PM's spokesman said: ""We've always said that, given what we know about waning immunity, it's right to look at what constitutes being fully vaccinated.

""We also want to make sure that those who had Covid and are more than willing to get their booster but just haven't been able to because of contracting Covid get an opportunity to do that."" Asked when the definition of fully vaccinated would change, he added: ""Again, we haven't set a specific time, it's something we want to keep under review given what we know about waning immunity, but beyond that we haven't set a date."" And the Environment Secretary George Eustice yesterday predicted the country would get past the Omicron peak of infections ""relatively soon"". Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""This is a difficult situation. It will be quite short lived because obviously we will get past this peak of infections relatively soon, ""But in the meantime we've taken that step to reduce the isolation period and we're doing all we can to make sure we can redeploy resources."" Asked when hospitals are likely to return to normal, he added: ""We've seen growing numbers of infections over the last couple of weeks but people will start to return. So even as some start to go off work, there will be others returning. It won't be too long where you'll have more people returning to work than isolating.

Around 65 percent of all UK adults have had a third dose

Researchers used blood samples to measure levels of oxidative stress, oxidant damage and glutathione in the patients, which were thereafter compared to those from healthy individuals.

Glutathione is crucial for the building and repair of tissues, helping produce chemicals and proteins needed in the body and immune system.

A deficiency in glutathione is an extremely rare disorder that can be classified into different types - mild, moderate and severe.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is aware of a mutation of COVID-19, but say it is not yet a Variant of Concern (VOC). Dubbed the IHU variant by those who found it, its official name is B.1.640.2. Express.co.uk can confirm at least two cases have been recorded in the UK.

The Government agency told Express.co.uk: ""We are aware of a small number of cases of B.1.640 in the UK and have been monitoring this particular variant specifically since late October. ""As it is in the nature of viruses to mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. ""At the present time, it has not been designated a Variant Under Investigation or a Variant of Concern. ""UKHSA is monitoring the domestic and international situation closely through our world-leading genomic surveillance.""

The variant is being monitored

It comes after experts in France were alarmed by ""the emergence of a new variant"" in the south of the country in December. They noted in a paper dated December 29 that they spotted a ""cluster"" of 12 patients in the same region whose tests showed ""an atypical combination"". The index case had returned from travelling to Cameroon, suggesting to experts that it may have originated in the African country. Professor Ewan Birney, Deputy Director of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, told Express.co.uk: ""The B.1.640.2 lineage which this paper describes from French samples with recent travel to Cameroon. ""This was designated in early December 2021 with virus sequences dating back to November, and this splits the B.1.640 lineage into two – B.1.640.1 and B.1.640.2.

""This does share many mutations with Omicron, but it has not expanded explosively across the world. ""As with all viruses with many mutations scientists keep a careful watch, but because this virus has not expanded it is not of high concern, and thus does not have a Greek letter assigned by WHO. ""The UK has seen a couple of these sequences, but nowhere near the scale of Omicron.” There are scores of new variants discovered all the time, but it does not necessarily mean they will be more dangerous than Delta or Alpha. Epidemiologist Dr Eric Feigl-Ding explained on Twitter: ""What makes a variant more well-known and dangerous is its ability to multiply because of the number of mutations it has in relation to the original virus.

""This is when it becomes a 'Variant of Concern' - like Omicron, which is more contagious and more past immunity evasive. ""It remains to be seen in which category this new variant will fall."" Prof Birney reiterated that the variant is not anywhere near as concerning as Omicron yet. He said: “Like all viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has replication errors, called mutations, with occur constantly. ""By sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome we can identify the family tree of the virus.
