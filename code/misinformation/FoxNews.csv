2021-02-26 22:09:09+00:00,56,"A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday voted to endorse Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, clearing the way for FDA leaders to grant emergency use authorization amid the ongoing fight against COVID-19.

The vote was 22-0, with all committee members voting in favor of endorsing the jab for emergency use approval.

The committee was charged with voting on the following question: ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risk for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?""

Although significant, the committee’s vote in favor of emergency use authorization (EUA) is not final. The vote will now go before FDA officials who will decide whether to grant EUA based on the committee’s findings. Such approval would come after the regulatory agency granted EUA to both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs late last year.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAYS IT CAN PRODUCE 20M DOSES OF COVID-19 VACCINE BY LATE MARCH

The FDA panel’s vote to approve the company’s EUA was expected, as the vaccine was found to have a ""favorable safety profile with no specific concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA,"" the FDA said in documents posted ahead of Friday's meeting of the panel of independent experts.

The vaccine candidate — derived from an adenovirus vector formula, unlike the vaccines created by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which were created using mRNA technology — showed to be 66.9% effective against moderate-to-severe disease in a global trial two weeks post-vaccination, per the documents.

HOW DO WE KNOW COVID-19 VACCINES ARE SAFE?

The committee noted no COVID-19-related deaths in vaccinated individuals as of Feb. 5, though seven COVID-19-related deaths occurred in the placebo group. All seven deaths involved individuals at study sites in South Africa with at least one underlying health condition.

""These results suggest that the vaccine is efficacious against mortality associated with COVID-19,"" the documents read.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MRNA VACCINES AND CONVENTIONAL ONES?

However, the committee noted that vaccine efficacy results had ""limited interpretability"" for those aged over 75 and ""certain racial groups."" There was not enough data to assess vaccine efficacy in those previously infected.

The most common reactions associated with the vaccine included pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue and myalgia, which were mostly ""mild and moderate,"" resolving within two days post-vaccination. Participants ages 18-59 experienced reactions occurring soon after vaccination more often than those aged over 60, per the documents.

It’s worth noting that if the FDA clears the J&J shot for U.S. use, it will not boost vaccine supplies significantly right away. Only a few million doses are expected to be ready for shipping in the first week. But J&J told Congress this week that it expects to provide 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million by summer.

Still, ""once approved for emergency use, the J&J vaccine will become the third sharp arrow in our quiver to defeat this awful virus. More production means more people will be vaccinated sooner – to mitigate transmission, quell the pandemic, and reduce future deaths,"" Dr. Robert Amler, dean of the School of Health Sciences and Practice at New York Medical College and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief medical officer, recently told Fox News.

2021-02-25 14:18:50+00:00,21,"Vice President Kamala Harris is urging Americans to get vaccinated for coronavirus while acknowledging the mistrust some have for medical research and development.

In an excerpt of an interview Harris did with Al Sharpton for MSNBC, Harris said that the Biden administration is distributing 2 million vaccines to local pharmacies, and that people should go out and get them.

MODERNA'S NEW COVID-19 VACCINE FOR SOUTH AFRICAN VARIANT READY FOR HUMAN TESTING, COMPANY SAYS

""I got vaccinated. I can tell you, first of all, that these vaccines are safe, it will save your life,"" Harris said.

Harris appeared to be addressing concerns among Black Americans, which Sharpton has addressed in the past. She noted that it was a Black doctor who was instrumental in the development of one of the vaccines.

""There's a Black woman, Dr. Kizzy Corbett who was part of the team of scientists who created this vaccine, and it will save your life,"" Harris said, in reference to Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, who was a leader on the team at the National Institutes of Health that worked with Moderna on their vaccine.

""Yes, we must speak truth about the history of medical testing in this country. We must be honest about the fact that people have a righteous skepticism about how it has been used, how it has been tested, and on whom it will be used,"" Harris continued, making an apparent allusion to the Tuskegee Study of syphilis in Black men, where participants were not informed of the nature of the study and were not properly treated, even after penicillin was being used to treat the illness.

""There is a righteous skepticism if you know history,"" Harris continued. ""But I promise you and I'm telling you this vaccine is safe, and it will save your life and the lives of your family and your community, and we have it within our power to actually do that.""

Sharpton said that he himself had been skeptical about the coronavirus vaccine, but said that Harris ""turned me around."" Harris herself had been skeptical of the vaccines while they were being developed during the Trump administration, saying she would not trust that they were safe based solely on Trump's word.

In her interview with Sharpton, Harris pointed out that when it comes to COVID-19, ""Black people are disproportionately likely to contract the virus and die from it.""

2021-02-24 21:53:54+00:00,41,"Moderna on Wednesday announced that the COVID-19 vaccine it recently developed to address a concerning new coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa is ready to be tested in humans in clinical trials.

Moderna in a news release said that it has shipped the first batch of doses of the new jab to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial ""that will be led and funded by the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).""

The new vaccine candidate, dubbed mRNA-1273.351, was created to better address the South African variant after the company’s existing vaccine — the second COVID-19 vaccine to see emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) late last year — was found to have reduced efficacy against the mutation.

In a study published last week, the biotech giant said its existing COVID-19 jab was found to have a six-fold reduction in vaccine-induced antibodies against the B.1.351 variant. (Despite this reduction, however, ""neutralizing titer levels with B.1.351 remain above levels that are expected to be protective,"" the company said.)

MILLIONS OF FAKE N95 MASKS SHIPPED TO MULTIPLE STATES, FEDS SAY

Moderna said Wednesday it plans to study three variations of a booster. First, it will study the variant-specific jab, which will be given at a lower dose than its original vaccine, and, also like its original vaccine, will require an evaluation and emergency use approval from the FDA before it can be distributed to the public, should the results of the trial prove promising.

Secondly, Moderna said it plans to study a combination of the original vaccine and the variant-specific one in a single jab at 50 micrograms or lower. Lastly, it will study the effects of a third dose of its original vaccine, but at a lower dosage.

""Moderna is committed to making as many updates to our vaccine as necessary until the pandemic is under control,"" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement. ""We hope to demonstrate that booster doses, if necessary, can be done at lower dose levels, which will allow us to provide many more doses to the global community in late 2021 and 2022 if necessary.""

The news of the booster comes just a month after Moderna said it was working on one. Like its first COVID-19 jab, the new vaccine candidate was also created using groundbreaking mRNA technology.

2021-02-24 13:21:53+00:00,66,"For many, the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is essentially one of the last major in-person events without masks or coronavirus pandemic restrictions before the shutdown began.

Now, one year later, both the world and CPAC 2021 are very different.

The annual conservative confab has moved from Maryland to Orlando, Florida, due to coronavirus restrictions.

""It was a very intentional decision to go to Florida,"" American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp told Fox News.

TRUMP SHOULD FOCUS ON 2022 ELECTIONS, NOT 2024, IN CPAC ADDRESS: NEWT GINGRICH

""We considered other states, Tennessee, Georgia Florida, Texas ... Florida just seems like the obvious place,"" he said. ""You know, the city of Orlando obviously has got the infrastructure to take a big conference. I mean, Las Vegas would have too, but ... the governor there just makes it impossible, is basically making it impossible for any business to be open, whereas the governor of Florida is doing just the opposite.""

Masks are required in all public spaces of CPAC, due to regulations in Orange County, Florida, and the Hyatt hotel where the conference is being held. Some of the peripheral activities around CPAC like book signings have been pared back to limit face-to-face contact.

But other things are the same.

CPAC is still bringing a high-profile slate of Republican speakers, including top lawmakers like Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be there. So will high-profile state officials like Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. Schlapp still expects a crowded hall for the conference's top speeches and a large number of politically engaged high school and college students.

And what's staying the same more than anything else is that former President Donald Trump will be at the center of the conference more than any other individual.

JOIN CPAC 2021 FROM HOME: HOW TO WATCH STREAMING COVERAGE ON FOX NATION

""I think all the ones that are seriously considering running -- and obviously Donald Trump is the big [one], is looming over all those decisions the most,"" Schlapp said. ""And look, you're not going to get the Republican nomination being a never-Trumper. You're not going to get the Republican nomination if you're not a strong conservative. So all of that kind of courting, it's appropriate that it starts at CPAC.""

Trump was confirmed over the weekend to be closing CPAC as the headliner on Sunday afternoon, the final day of the conference. And his son, Donald Trump Jr., will be headlining the first full day of CPAC on Friday.

Notably absent at CPAC are any Republicans who have been vocally critical of Trump. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., won't be present. Neither will Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who was the highest-ranking House Republican to vote to impeach Trump earlier this year.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who in the aftermath of Cheney's impeachment vote flew to Wyoming just to hold a political rally against Cheney, will be attending the conference.

""We are in a battle for the soul of the Republican party and I intend to win it,"" Gaetz said at the Wyoming rally. ""You can help me. You can help me break a corrupt system. You can send a representative who actually represents you and you can send Liz Cheney home -- back home to Washington, D.C.""

Gaetz at that rally took a call from Trump Jr., who also pushed for Cheney's ouster in a 2022 primary.

PENCE DECLINED CPAC INVITATION: SOURCE

Some of the other high-profile Trump loyalists who will be present at CPAC are Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who led the push earlier this year to overturn the Electoral College results in some states; Paxton, who led a lawsuit to overturn four states' election results; Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Devin Nunes, R-Calif., two of Trump's staunchest allies in the House; and former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.

Perhaps also hinting at the pro-Trump nature of the conference, CPAC 2021 includes seven separate panels on ""protecting elections,"" which alternatively examine similar claims of widespread voter fraud made by Trump after the presidential election or how to strengthen elections for the future.

""We're going to go through the real stuff. Not the imagined charges, not the fantastical charges. Just the real stuff,"" Schlapp said. ""All of the globalists tell us that we should be going along with the globe. Well, the globe tells us this is the wrong way to vote. You vote in person. That's what you do in these other democracies. You vote once and there's a lot of security around it. So much security that the American government often helps pay for that security.""

Conservatives and many election experts ahead of the presidential election widely agreed that some changes moving toward increased mail balloting in the U.S. made elections less secure. But despite intense scrutiny and a litany of court cases, no evidence has emerged to support the idea that there was widespread voter fraud nearly large enough to affect the result of the presidential election.

CPAC will also be a forum for those on the right to sharpen their arguments against President Biden, whose administration began with a flurry of executive orders that have rankled Republicans. Schlapp specifically slammed the Biden order that revoked approval for the Keystone XL Pipeline, which led to a significant number of jobs being lost.

""A lot of fair-minded people are like, 'well, let's see if we get the AOC Joe Biden and the Bernie Sanders Joe Biden, or do we get the Joe Manchin Joe Biden?'"" Schlapp said of the early days of the Biden administration. ""I think a lot of people believe that the Joe Biden who emerges will be whatever is given on the cue cards, right? Like, he's being driven by the people around him.""

""I think now people are beginning to see these executive orders they're going to get,"" Schlapp said. ""In some ways, he has my begrudging respect. He does all these things he says he would do. That means we're going to get a very aggressive socialist agenda. That will mean that Republicans better find their voice fast and they better start fighting fast.""",FoxNews,"['joe', 'florida', 'covid19', 'conference', 'trump', 'biden', 'gathering', 'vote', 'ready', 'going', 'readies', 'conservatives', 'bonanza', 'schlapp', 'republican', 'cpac', 'amid']",0
2021-02-23 15:52:10+00:00,198,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci's often inconsistent comments and mixed messages on the coronavirus pandemic are prompting renewed scrutiny as debate rages over reopening schools and businesses nearly a year after the lockdowns started.

""Dr. Fauci is a very good public-health official. His job is to advise policy makers and inform the public,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said on Tuesday. ""But his job is NOT to decide what we can do, where we can go or which places can open or close And his job is NOT to mislead or scare us into doing the 'right things.'""

""Why should we trust Fauci with a national plan? Back in March, Fauci famously told Americans, 'There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,'"" wrote David Harsanyi in the National Review. ""(Fauci now says we should wear two masks. No thanks, Dad.)""

Masks

Fauci in an interview on ""60 Minutes"" in early March of last year warned of ""unintended consequences"" of masks, saying ""people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.""

DR. FAUCI: IT'S 'POSSIBLE' AMERICANS MAY STILL BE WEARING FACE MASKS IN 2022

On masks, Fauci and former Surgeon General Jerome Adams – who also warned against buying and wearing masks in spring 2020 – said officials recommended against wearing masks early in the pandemic because at the time there was a massive shortage of PPE for medical workers who needed it most. Further, more evidence of asymptomatic spread of the virus later came out.

Fauci later enthusiatically embraced wearing masks.

""What has changed in our recommendation?"" Adams said in a White House briefing in July. ""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms.""

Now, Fauci more recently has backed recommendations that Americans wear two masks instead of one if possible in order to keep the masks tighter on people's faces.

""If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective,"" Fauci told NBC News last month. The CDC officially put out double-masking guidelines this month.

FAUCI BACKS 'DOUBLE-MASKING' IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT, SAYS 'LIKELY MORE EFFECTIVE'

Vaccinations

Another issue on which Fauci has adjusted his stances is on exactly what level of vaccination is necessary for the U.S. to reach herd immunity to the virus. Fauci previously said the percentage of Americans who need to be vaccinated to reach that goal was 70% before revising that number up to higher than 80%.

This inspired a story in the New York Times that accused Fauci of ""quietly shifting"" recommendations. Fauci then explained to the paper that he was taking public opinion polls into account in how he shaped his comments.

""When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75%,"" Fauci said, according to the paper. ""Then, when newer surveys said 60% or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.""

He continued: ""We have to have some humility here ... We really don’t know what the real number is. I think the real range is somewhere between 70 to 90%. But, I’m not going to say 90%.""

And on returning to normal after Americans get their vaccines, Fauci has made several different comments that are not necessarily consistent.

DR. FAUCI: US WILL HAVE 600M CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DOSES BY JULY 2021

""It's gonna depend very much on what the percent or level of efficacy of the vaccine is,"" Fauci said in an interview of what post-vaccine life would look like with Bloomberg in August. ""I would be very happy with 70-75% and I would be accepting of 50 to 60%.""

Fauci said continued public health measures would be necessary if the vaccine was on the low-end of effectiveness. But vaccines have been shown to be significantly more effective than anticipated – upwards of 90% – and Fauci now says Americans may need to wear masks until 2022.

""Obviously, with a 90-plus-percent effective vaccine, you could feel much more confident,"" Fauci said on CNN in November. ""But I would recommend to people to not abandon all public health measures just because you have been vaccinated, because even though, for the general population, it might be 90 to 95% effective, you don't necessarily know, for you, how effective it is.""

He added Sunday, also on CNN, that whether Americans wear masks into 2022 ""depends on the level of dynamics of the virus that's in the community... If you see the level coming down really, really very low, I want it to keep going down to a baseline that's so low, that there's virtually no threat – or not no. It'll never be zero, but a minimal, minimal threat that you will be exposed to someone who is infected.""

FAUCI CAUTIONS AGAINST DINING OUT, EVEN WHEN VACCINATED

More than 500,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, which is an airborne disease that is not severe in most healthy people but can be deadly to older people and those with compromised immune systems. Fauci and his defenders have said their recommendations on the virus, which did not exist before 2019, have evolved as Americans' understanding of the virus has evolved. They also say the strict recommendations reflect the vast number of deaths the virus is capable of causing and has caused.

But those who are more critical of Fauci say he made pronouncements of ""science"" with far too much finality when the science was not in fact settled; has not leveled with Americans in some cases, including on the length of the lockdowns; and is not taking into account the mental and emotional toll of the virus lockdowns.

Also this month, Fauci said on NBC's ""Today"" that ""by the time we get to April, that would be what I would call ... open season"" on vaccines and nearly full vaccination by ""the middle and end of the summer."" The epidemiologist was then contradicted by President Biden, who said in a CNN town hall that vaccine would be available to all Americans by the end of July, and it would take longer than that to get doses in everybody's arms.

Fox News reached out to the NIAID for comment on Fauci's messaging on masks, herd immunity, vaccines and when life may return to normal and did not receive a response.

Lockdowns

Many Americans continue to wonder when the nation's top infectious disease expert will tell them that they can resume life as normal.

One issue on which Fauci has remained more consistent is the reopening schools, which he has reiterated is possible before teachers get vaccines. In fact, he said this month on CBS that vaccinating every teacher before opening schools is ""non-workable.""

Fauci on Sunday declined to say on CNN that grandparents who are fully vaccinated could see their grandchildren, saying ""I don't want to be making a recommendation now on public TV. I would want to sit down with the team, take a look at that.""

That prompted a rant from Meghan McCain on ""The View.""

""I was very frustrated when I saw this clip,"" she said. ""The fact that Dr. Fauci is going on CNN and he can’t tell me if I get the vaccine, I’ll be able to have dinner with my family... It’s terribly inconsistent messaging and it continues to be inconsistent messaging.""

Fauci answered some of that criticism on CNN Tuesday.

""If I'm fully vaccinated and my daughter comes in the house and she's fully vaccinated ... common sense tells you that in fact you don't have to be as stringent,"" Fauci said. But, he added, ""we want to get firm recommendations from the CDC"" on what people can and cannot do when they are vaccinated.

2021-02-22 15:00:01+00:00,88,"John Daukas, who served as acting U.S. attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, explained on Monday why he believes New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo should be worried about a federal probe into the alleged undercounting of nursing home deaths amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

""On March 25th the governor issued his order that required nursing homes to accept people who could be infected, still infected with COVID, and something that's often overlooked, the order prohibited the nursing homes from testing those people to determine if they had COVID so those people were put back in with a very vulnerable population,"" Daukas told ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday.

""New York by the summer had by far the highest death rate in the country, over 32,000 deaths, twice the deaths of any other state,"" he continued.

""But the governor was going around saying the nursing home deaths were very low and that didn't seem right to us at the Department of Justice so we asked for information on state-run nursing homes, which my group, the civil rights division, has jurisdiction over and New York provided data to us that showed that they had understated the deaths in those nursing homes by one-third,"" Daukas added.

Cuomo has found himself at the center of a federal investigation into whether his administration sought to hide the true toll of the pandemic.

The New York Post reported earlier this month that Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo’s top aide, told lawmakers the administration had withheld the numbers for fear of them being ""used against us.""

In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Daukas, wrote that DeRosa’s reported admissions weren't ""merely negligent, but intentional and perhaps criminal.""

Daukas said numerous federal statutes could apply, noting that Cuomo’s administration is accusing of both making false statements to the federal government and trying to thwart an investigation.

""Even if it cannot be proved that the Cuomo administration knowingly provided false information to Justice and the (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), New York’s willful failure to provide information may itself constitute a criminal offense—particularly if the intent was to thwart a federal investigation—which, after all, is exactly what Ms. DeRosa reportedly said the administration did,"" Daukas wrote.

On Monday, Daukas told host Steve Doocy that after the Department of Justice learned that nursing home deaths were understated, ""we went to our sister division, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice that asked for the same information for the over 600 private nursing homes in the state of New York and New York stonewalled and didn't produce anything throughout the rest of the year, perhaps waiting for a change in administration.""

Daukas appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday with Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean, who lost her elderly in-laws to COVID-19. Dean had said she believes Cuomo or his administration were behind the decision to allow infected patients back into nursing homes.

She told Fox News in August her husband’s father, who was in a nursing home and rehabilitation center, died the same day she and her husband found out he was sick.

CUOMO SCANDAL WILL BE HOT TOPIC AS HEARINGS FOR BIDEN AG NOMINEE MERRICK GARLAND KICK OFF NEXT WEEK

Dean noted that her husband’s mother ""contracted coronavirus in her assisted living facility and was transported to the hospital and died in the hospital."" Her mother-in-law died on April 14, about two weeks after her father-in-law passed away from the novel coronavirus.

On Monday an emotional Dean told Doocy, that she is ""grateful"" to Daukas and former Attorney General William Barr ""for opening up this investigation."" She referred to Barr and Daukas as ""brave people,"" saying if it weren’t for their actions, she doesn’t ""believe there would be an investigation into Cuomo.""

""John Daukas is a hero and the reporting today in the Wall Street journal is incredible,"" Dean said. ""It's incredible for all of us, all of the families that want justice.""

Doocy asked Dean, ""What will justice look like to your family?""

""I want the whole truth and nothing but the truth and I think we are going down that path,"" she responded.

She stressed that because of Daukas and the Department of Justice she believes her family will get answers, adding that she hopes ""Biden's Department of Justice"" will continue the effort.

Doocy asked Daukus if he feels ""confident ultimately we will know the truth and Janice's family will get justice?""

""I do,"" he responded. ""This is something that's hurt so many different people that we really need to get to the bottom of this.""

""It's not a political issue. It's an issue about justice,"" he continued.

During an appearance on ABC’s ""This Week"" Psaki did not directly answer a question from Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl who pointed to Biden’s comments from April 2020.

CUOMO AIDE TELLS NY DEMOCRATS ADMINISTRATION HID NURSING HOME DATA TO KEEP IT FROM TRUMP DOJ: REPORT

At the time, Biden said the ""governor of New York has done one hell of a job"" and that he thinks Cuomo is ""sort of the gold standard.""

Karl pointed to the New York governor’s alleged undercounting of nursing home deaths and the fact that he reportedly misled legislatures in the state.

""So does President Biden still consider Andrew Cuomo ‘the gold standard’ when it comes to leadership on the pandemic?"" Karl asked.

""We work with Gov. Cuomo just like we work with governors across the country,"" Psaki responded. ""He’s also the chair of the NGA [National Governors Association] so he plays an important role in ensuring that we’re coordinating closely and getting assistance out to people of his state and to states across the country and we’ll continue to do that.""

Psaki went on to say that ""there, of course, will be a process,"" which she said will include investigations, adding that ""we’ll leave that to others to determine, the appropriate law enforcement authorities to determine how that path is going to move as we look forward.""

She then said that ""we are going to continue to work with a range of governors, including of course Gov. Cuomo because we think the people of New York, the people of states across the country need assistance, not just to get through the pandemic, but to get through this difficult economic time and that’s where our focus remains.""

RON KIM, NY DEM THREATENED BY CUOMO, SAYS HE WON'T SUPPORT HIM POLITICALLY AMID NURSING HOME SCANDAL

Karl pressed Psaki on the issue, reiterating his question.

""But Jen, my question was does President Biden still believe that Andrew Cuomo … represents the gold standard on leadership during this pandemic?"" he asked, adding that he was looking for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.

""It doesn’t always have to be a yes or no answer,"" Psaki responded. ""I think the president is focused on his goal, his objective as president of the United States.""

""He’s going to continue to work with Gov. Cuomo just like he’ll continue to work with governors across the country,"" she continued. ""And I’m not here to give new labels or names from the president, I’m here to communicate with you about what our focuses are and what his objectives are as president.""

Cuomo has faced calls to resign since the Associated Press reported his administration had significantly underreported the number of recovering COVID-19 patients who were sent back to nursing homes to recover under a controversial order he implemented last March. The Associated Press found that nearly 15,000 long-term care patients died of COVID-19 at nursing homes, up from the roughly 8,500 deaths previously disclosed.

Criticism intensified after Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa admitted during a private call that the administration withheld data requested by New York State legislatures because they worried it could be ""used against us"" by the Justice Department under then-President Donald Trump.

On Monday, Cuomo held a press conference where the embattled Democratic New York governor admitted that he should have moved sooner to release relevant data related to COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes amid mounting criticism of his administration’s handling of the scandal.

The governor sought to clarify his team’s actions at the press conference, telling reporters that the Department of Justice and state legislatures submitted requests for data at the same time last summer. Cuomo said his team opted to prioritize the federal inquiry and informed state lawmakers their request for data would be ""paused"" in the meantime.

But several Democratic lawmakers, including New York State Sens. Jessica Ramos, Alessandra Biaggi, and Gustavo Rivera denied that Cuomo’s office ever informed them of its decision.

2021-02-16 11:14:36+00:00,42,"Members of Congress have signaled a renewed focus on President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan after the conclusion of last weekend's impeachment trial of former President Trump.

Biden is scheduled to visit Milwaukee on Tuesday and is expected to sell his $1.9-trillion coronavirus stimulus plan that seems to be in jeopardy over a minimum wage provision. The Financial Times, citing the White House, reported that Biden intends to make his case about the importance of ""maintaining economic support"" during the country's COVID-19 recovery.

He is expected to talk about the need to make investments ""to strengthen our collective competitiveness and the importance of updating global rules to tackle economic challenged such as those posed by China.""

Last week, Biden reportedly told a group of senators that if the U.S. fails to invest in its infrastructure, China will ""eat our lunch.""

FOX BUSINESS: HERE'S HOW TRUMP ACQUITTAL COULD AFFECT CHECKS

Bloomberg reported that Biden could face serious challenges in his attempt to gain Republican support for his proposal, especially with a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage requirement.

The New York Times reported last week that Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, issued a proposal that passed a voice vote that prohibited such an increase during the pandemic. Bloomberg pointed out that at least two Democrats – Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema – have said they would not back the wage increase, which jeopardizes the Democrat simple majority.

Democrats are moving to fast-track Biden's pandemic relief plan, with the Senate approving a budget resolution earlier this month that allows them to pass the measure without any Republican buy-ins using a procedural tool known as ""reconciliation.""

Yahoo Finance reported, citing the Congressional Budget Office, that raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would impact 17 million workers, and reduce the workforce by 1.4 million. The number of Americans in poverty would also drop by .9 million.

Biden has suggested he may be flexible on the stimulus’ topline figure, but the $1,400 amount — on top of $600 in payments approved in December — appears to be nonnegotiable.

The report pointed to a recent meeting Biden had with moderate Republican senators at the White House to talk about a compromise on the deal. These senators countered with a $618 billion package, one-third of what Biden is offering.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, took to Twitter on Sunday to say raising the minimum wage to $15 is not a ""radical idea.""

""I’m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to the American people,"" he said.

""What's radical is the fact that millions of Americans are forced to work for starvation wages, while 650 billionaires became over $1 trillion richer during a global pandemic. Yes. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage,"" he tweeted.

The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009. Biden has said, ""No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line.""

Sinema told Politico that she believed the focus should be on COVID-19 relief.

""The minimum wage provision is not appropriate for the reconciliation process,"" she said. ""It is not a budget item. And it shouldn’t be there.""

2021-02-14 13:39:00+00:00,77,"After the state of Pennsylvania implemented stringent containment measures in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, firearm violence in the city of Philadephia increased.

A new report from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University showed that measures taken in an effort to stop the spread of the virus compounded inequities and exacerbated problems already prevalent in low-income communities -- some with fatal consequences.

NYPD BEEFS UP BOOTS ON GROUND AFTER SPIKE IN SUBWAY VIOLENCE

In a Feb. 11 news release, researchers stated that the increase in incidents could be linked back to the enactment of a lockdown and other public health policies, as well as nationwide protests ignited by the Minneapolis Police killing of George Floyd in May of last year.

The release noted that firearm-injured patients were presenting at higher rates to surgeons and trauma centers around the city in the wake of these events.

The team used data from the Philadelphia Police Department's registry of shooting victims dating back to Jan. 1, 2016, through Nov. 26 of last year.

""And so, we took those data and aggregated them by week, which means that we just very simply converted them to accounts of shootings per week,"" the report's senior author and an assistant professor of epidemiology Christopher N Morrison, PhD, told Fox News. ""And, we used the data from...the first week of 2016 up until when we did the analysis which was the end of November. And then, we used the statistical methods""

The study, published in the JAMA Network on Feb. 10., followed three specific time points including the Mar. 15, 2020 closure of nonessential businesses, the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd, and the Jun. 26, 2020 partial lifting of coronavirus containment policies.

Using what are called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, the group systematically tested ""local and 52-week seasonally lagged autoregressive, difference, and moving average terms to remove trends and account for temporal dependencies"" and three transfer functions ""assessed associations between the interruption variables and the dependent measure.""

The team selected the best fitting model based on ARIMA terms and transfer functions. The statistical models were estimated using SCA Workbench software.

""All it does is it looks at trends over time. And, you can specify interruptions. So, and it points to inflection: where the trends change,"" Morrison said.

Their work concluded that during the 256 weeks included in the study, 7,159 individuals were shot in the city, breaking down to an average of 25 individuals shot per week.

In the weeks after the city's first containment policy, however, that average almost doubled to 46 individuals shot per week.

""The killing of George Floyd and the partial lifting of containment policies were not independently associated with any changes in shooting incidence,"" they added.

""What we found was that the best description of these data statistically, was that there was an inflection point at that March 16 week. That was...a gradual permanent, which means it was a curved slope upwards. So, it's not an abrupt step. It's not an immediate increase. It's just a gradual increase that tapers,"" Morrison stated. ""And so, testing the other inflection points -- the killing of George Florida and the partial lifting of the containment policies -- didn't seem to affect that trend.""

CHICAGO MAN ACCUSED OF POSING AS POLICE OFFICER HAS DONE SO BEFORE: REPORTS

While violent crime notably rose in other cities across the country, the report said that limitations include that their conclusions may not be generalizable to other contexts.

In addition, the data set from Philadelphia Police did not include self-inflicted shootings, and missing or inaccurate reports could bias the results, they warn.

Lastly, the authors wrote that social and economic distress in the City of Brotherly Love may account for their observed associations and that firearm violence in Philadelphia has been ""empirically tied to poverty and structural place-based economic disinvestment.""

Morrison said his co-authors like first author and Temple University Director of Trauma Research and Assistant Professor of Surgery Jessica H. Beard, MD, MPH had seen the increases firsthand working in trauma centers over the last year.

""In the city of Philadelphia, shootings are often geographically concentrated in lower-income communities,"" Beard said in the release. ""These communities have not only been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease itself, but the pandemic and its associated policies have also exacerbated issues that were already present, including unemployment, poverty, structural racism and place-based economic disinvestment, which are empirically tied to firearm violence in Philadelphia.""

""We know that in Philadelphia gun violence is very heavily socially and spatially structured. It’s concentrating in certain areas and amongst certain populations. And, the COVID-19 has affected those same disadvantaged groups. And so, it seems very plausible that that's what's going on there,"" Morrison said. ""So, try to understand whether that is indeed the case is an important question.""

Morrison said once they fully understood this increase, then people could do something about it -- though they have more work to do and the prior trend tells them nothing about what might happen in the future.

""Every additional shooting is another person, another body that they need to stitch up. It’s a person who's got a family, with a history. And so, the human cost is something that is very important to emphasize,"" he concluded.

According to reporting from The Philadelphia Inquirer, nearly 500 people were killed and more than 2,200 shot in the city last year.

They said that more than 2,240 people had been shot since Jan. 1 -- 40% increase about what police had ever recorded, although they highlighted that the statistics dated back to 2007 when the department first started to keep track of shooting victims separately from the broader category of assaults involving a gun.

Additionally, the number of those killed in 2020 was 40% higher than the year before and more than in all of 2013 and 2014 combined.

""The newly released study by Temple University examining the connection between the increase in gun violence and containment policies and practices enacted to respond to the global COVID-19 pandemic affirm that we in the Administration are looking at this issue of gun violence and systemic oppression with the right lens,"" a spokesperson for Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney told Fox News.

""While it was critical to take all CDC and science-based actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 -- which included enacting the city’s stay-at-home order, as well as businesses and gathering restrictions -- there is no question that the pandemic contributed to job loss, and reduced access to social services and youth activities designed to reduce violence,"" they said. ""The Administration also recognizes how difficult it has been for on-the-ground crisis response teams to personally interact with individuals in need of alternatives to violence, given the social-distancing requirements.""

""The pandemic also resulted in the closing of courts, and inhibited the ability of probation officers to make their personal contacts and check in on individuals assigned to them in the criminal justice system,"" the spokesperson continued. ""These are just some of the many ways COVID-19 caused increases to gun violence, however we remain committed to saving lives, and lifting up our neighborhoods as the great assets they are, with public safety as the highest priority.""",FoxNews,"['data', 'covid19', 'doubles', 'violence', 'city', 'firearm', 'increase', 'policies', 'measures', 'lockdown', 'individuals', 'philadelphia', 'containment', 'shot', 'report']",0

Andrew Cuomo, attempted to walk back an earlier admission that the state withheld COVID-19 nursing home death data on purpose, insisting Friday that the governor's office was ""comprehensive and transparent"" in responding to records requests from the Trump administration's Justice Department.

On a phone call with New York's Democratic lawmakers on Thursday, DeRosa reportedly said that Cuomo's administration feared the data about COVID-19 deaths could ""be used against us"" by the Justice Department in the midst of its federal probe initiated against four states regarding nursing home deaths, including New York.

""We were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, what we start saying, was going to be used against us while we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation,"" DeRosa told the lawmakers, according to the New York Post, which first reported the information.

But on Friday, DeRosa sought to clarify her comments, saying that she was ""explaining that when we received the DOJ inquiry, we needed to temporarily set aside the Legislature’s request to deal with the federal request first.""

""We informed the houses of this at the time,"" DeRosa said in a statement that was posted on Twitter by Rich Azzopardi, a senior Cuomo adviser. ""We were comprehensive and transparent in our responses to the DOJ, and then had to immediately focus our resources on the second wave and vaccine rollout.

""As I said on a call with legislators, we could not fulfill their request as quickly as anyone would have liked. But we are committed to being better partners going forward as we share the same goal of keeping New Yorkers as healthy as possible during the pandemic.""

CUOMO AIDE TELLS NY DEMOCRATS ADMINISTRATION HID NURSING HOME DATA TO KEEP IT FROM TRUMP DOJ: REPORT

Assemblymember John T. McDonald, a Democrat who recently met with Cuomo administration officials to get answers about the way the COVID-19 pandemic was being handled, told Fox News in a statement that the ""hearings raised serious questions and concerns that were also later reflected in the recent NYS Attorney General's report on the issue.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in late January that an investigation by her office revealed Cuomo's administration had undercounted the COVID-19 death toll linked to nursing homes by as much as 50%.

""We expressed our frustration regarding the delay in receiving the answers that the public deserved,"" McDonald told Fox News.

""At the meeting, Dr. Zucker explained in detail the challenges of aggregating the data accurately. Melissa DeRosa then stated that a document request from the Department of Justice added to the delay since the DOJ request had to be fulfilled on a priority basis and therefore the work on the state legislative responses was paused. She explained that since the DOJ matter has been presumably resolved, the state legislative responses will now be prioritized and we will receive the information requested,"" he said.

""My takeaway from the conversation was that NYSDOH is now working in earnest to provide the requested information and that we will continue to have a dialogue that leads to accountability. I am committed to getting answers to the many outstanding questions and discerning the facts we need to make informed decisions on next steps. Anyone who lost a loved one in a nursing home deserves these answers and my colleagues and are I committed to ensuring full transparency on this issue.""

On Wednesday, the state revealed the number of deaths was actually 15,049 residents in elder care facilities (nursing homes and assisted living/adult care facilities) -- nearly 10,000 more than the state Health Department was reporting on Jan. 27, 2021 -- according to a letter from the State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker sent to Senate Democrats.

Biden said the government on Thursday afternoon formalized its contract with Pfizer and German company BioNTech, the maker of the first COVID-19 vaccine, to see emergency use approval in the U.S., for an additional 100 million doses.

The government also formalized its contract with Moderna, the maker of the second vaccine, to see emergency use approval, for an additional 100 million doses as well.

Overall, the additional 200 million doses will increase the country's vaccine supply by about 50% to 600 million total doses.

Ethics experts are raising concerns about President Biden’s surgeon son-in-law Howard Krein, who has ties to a health care company working with the federal government to streamline vaccine distribution.

Asked by Fox News’ Peter Doocy about the red flags that have been raised, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, ""The president has made clear there will be an absolute wall between him and any business connected with his family members.""

Psaki reiterated Biden’s promise that no family member would have any say in policy-making decisions.

Asked how the White House could guarantee no one was using Biden’s office for personal gain, Psaki said, ""We’ve put in place stringent policies.""

BIDEN REPORTEDLY WARNED FAMILY ABOUT BUSINESS DEALINGS BEFORE ELECTION

""There is not a single member of the family who is employed at the White House, who will have an office at White House, or who will benefit financially. Those are strict ethics requirements put in place, and the president has approved.""

Krein, married to Biden’s daughter Ashley, was an early investor in StartUp Health. In December, boutique tech firm Yosi Health reached out to StartUp Health for help due to the company’s special government connection.

Yosi CEO Hari Prasad asked StartUp Health to introduce its platform to government officials. ""Our goal with StartUp Health is to leverage their relationships and work with state and federal agencies,"" he told ABC News.

Shortly after StartUp Health was started, its founders were invited to the White House to meet with then-President Obama to preview its plans.

Krein recounted the meeting in a 2015 interview. ""I happened to be talking to my father-in-law that day and I mentioned Steve and Unity were down there [in D.C.],"" Krein said. ""[Biden] knew about StartUp Health and was a big fan of it. He asked for Steve's number and said, 'I have to get them up here to talk with Barack.' The Secret Service came and got Steve and Unity and brought them to the Oval Office.""

Krein helps oversee the company's investments in hundreds of companies, some looking to get through to federal agencies to assist with the coronavirus response. As StartUp Health has expanded its presence in the health care sphere, its executives have touted the White House meeting with Obama and their special ties to Biden.

The president has also been a supporter of the business Krein started with his brother Stephen Krein, Unity Stoakes. He has spoken at corporate conferences to entice venture capitalists for the company, in addition to having invited the Unity Stoakes’ executives to the Oval Office meeting with Obama.

BIDEN'S BROTHER PROMOTED RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT IN AD FOR FLORIDA LAW FIRM: REPORT

Krein drew criticism earlier this year when the pandemic exploded and he began informally advising the Biden campaign’s pandemic response plan. At the same time, StartUp Health was pushing to invest in firms that were trying to tailor products to help the pandemic response. Concerns arose that Krein could be putting in a good word for the firm to help its companies score government contracts. A campaign spokesperson said in October that Krein did not go beyond sharing his experience treating COVID-19 patients.

Now with Biden in office, some are asking: should Krein advise companies looking to score lucrative government contracts? Should he weigh in on his father-in-law’s policy decisions that could help those companies? Could he be privy to private government information that could drive investment decisions?

""Howard Krein is playing with fire,"" Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog group​, told ABC News​. ""If he gets too close to that flame – if he is trying to either cash in on his relationship with the president, or he is trying to influence policy – the flame is going to get him.

Instead, coronavirus likely spread from an animal to humans, WHO food safety and animal diseases expert Peter Ben Embarek said. The WHO and China have faced strong criticism from around the world over their pandemic response, as China blocked WHO investigators from entering Wuhan for months; they finally arrived in mid-January of this year.

""Our initial findings suggest that the introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one that will require more studies and more specific, targeted research,"" Embarek told reporters.

WHO REFUSES TO CONFIRM CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATED IN CHINA AS BIDEN STRENGTHENS TIES

""However, the findings suggest that the laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population,"" Embarek said. ""Therefore it is not a hypothesis that we advise to suggest future studies ... into the understanding of the origin of the virus.""

Embarek made the assessment at the end of a visit to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where a team of scientists is investigating the possible origins of the coronavirus. The first cases were discovered in the city in December 2019.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology has collected extensive virus samples, leading to allegations that it may have caused the original outbreak by leaking the virus into the surrounding community. China has strongly rejected that possibility and has promoted other theories that the virus may have originated elsewhere. The team is considering several theories for how the disease first ended up in humans.

IS THE COMMUNIST REGIME LYING TO THE WORLD?

The WHO team draws on experts from 10 countries. Its mission is intended to be an initial step delving into the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in bats before being passed to humans through another species of wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat, which is considered an exotic delicacy by some in China.

Transmission through the trade in frozen products was also a likely possibility, Embarek said.

2021-02-04 02:03:07+00:00,36,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo is one for visual learning, and he spared little expense for one such giant prop to help New Yorkers understand the coronavirus curve.

In the early days of the pandemic, he often brought out posters depicting a Covid-19 ""mountain,"" where the peak of the mountain represented the day with the highest coronavirus death count.

But during a coronavirus news conference on July 29, the governor dramatically pulled back a navy curtain to reveal a monstrous green mound his team had constructed out of foam and paint.

Social media had a laugh at the enormous prop, but the governor’s office had poured time and money into the project.

At the time, the governor’s office said the materials to craft the foam mountain cost $185 and the governor’s team was ""happy to support businesses in New York.""

Through a Freedom of Information Law request, the Democrat and Chronicle found the bill was $415.34 for 10 polystyrene foam boards and two gallons of paint and had come from Lowes’, a North Carolina-based hardware chain store.

The entire Lowes receipt was reimbursed from Cuomo’s campaign coffers, Heather Groll, a spokesperson for the state Office of General Services, which originally purchased the materials, told the Chronicle.

According to campaign filings, Cuomo's campaign paid OGS $415.34 as ""Reimb. for Mansion Activities,"" referencing the governor’s mansion where Cuomo lives. It did not specify the mountain sculpture.

Groll also said only a portion of the $400-plus supplies went to use -- $183.72. She didn’t specify how the state came up with that number. On the cost of labor to construct the prop, Groll replied: ""The mountain was built in-house.""

Cuomo shuttled his foam mountain between Manhattan and Albany and used it as the backdrop for a number of briefings.

When it was unveiled, the mountain had a sign with the number 42 at its top to signify the number of days it took from the first coronavirus case in the state on March 1 to what was then the peak number of cases per day, 10,841 on April 3.

2021-02-03 20:02:56+00:00,86,"Teachers don’t need coronavirus vaccinations in order for schools to reopen safely, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Walensky said there is a growing body of evidence to suggest schools can safely reopen without vaccinated teachers.

""Vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools,"" she said during a White House COVID-19 briefing Wednesday. Jeffrey Zients, COVID-19 response coordinator, reiterated President Biden’s strong desire to reopen schools.

BLOOMBERG: BIDEN NEEDS TO 'STAND UP' TO UNIONS ON SCHOOL REOPENINGS, TEACHERS NEED TO 'SUCK IT UP'

""That means that every school has the equipment and resources to open safely, not just private schools or schools in wealthy areas, but all schools,"" Zients said. ""And that’s why we need the American Rescue Plan passed now.""

President Biden’s COVID-19 relief plan costs $1.9 trillion, and includes funding for schools’ virus testing, ventilation, PPE and proper sanitization. As of last week, 38% of K-12 public schools were still offering ""virtual only"" classes. About 38% are attending fully in-person sessions, and the rest are on a hybrid schedule, according to Burbio, which scrapes school websites for data.

Tension is building on school systems nationwide to reopen classrooms, as many teachers have yet to be vaccinated. In Chicago, the rancor is so great that teachers are on the brink of striking. In California, a frustrated Gov. Gavin Newsom implored schools to find a way to reopen. In Cincinnati, some students returned to classrooms Tuesday after a judge threw out a teachers union lawsuit over safety concerns.

While some communities maintain that online classes remain the safest option for everyone, some parents, with backing from politicians and administrators, have complained that their children’s education is suffering from sitting at home in front of their computers and that the isolation is damaging them emotionally.

Federal recommendations for vaccine prioritizations group teachers in Phase 1B with other essential workers and older adults. The guidance previously set forth by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is just a recommendation, however, and states ultimately decide how to prioritize their vaccines.

Recent findings from the CDC, published in JAMA Network, found coronavirus transmission at schools was very low when mask-wearing and social distancing measures were taken.

2021-02-03 01:58:12+00:00,140,"With President Biden relaxing Tuesday some immigration policies bolstered under the Trump administration, U.S. health and immigration officials have been vague about coronavirus testing for people caught crossing the southern border illegally.

Customs and Border Patrol has reported an uptick in migrant apprehensions in the wake of some of Biden’s new policies, especially near the Rio Grande Valley and Tucson, Arizona.

CBP said it began taking COVID-19 precautions back in March 2020, around the beginning of the pandemic.

BIDEN SIGNS NEW IMMIGRATION ORDERS TO ERASE TRUMP PROGRAMS

""By processing in the field and quickly expelling individuals who cross the border illegally, we protect them, our agents, and the American public from potential exposure to COVID-19,"" CBP said in a statement Tuesday. ""These measures will remain in place until the CDC Director determines that the danger of the further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger to the public health.""

The procedures include COVID-19 screenings upon apprehension, according to CBP.

""CBP personnel conduct initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19 and consult with onsite medical personnel, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or local health systems as appropriate,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Onsite medical personnel can provide basic assessment and supportive treatment, but suspected COVID-19 cases are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, and treatment.""

But child migrants are exempt from federal laws that allow the immediate deportation of apprehended adults.

""When immediate expulsion is not possible, the U.S. Government expeditiously returns illegal border crossers to their country of origin,"" CBP said. ""CBP uses a combination of onsite contract medical personnel and referrals to local health systems to provide medical support for persons in custody who require medical attention.""

It’s unclear just how many migrants caught crossing the border have COVID-19, but the illness has killed a number of detainees during the pandemic. ICE reported Monday that of the nearly 15,000 migrants currently in custody, 526 have tested positive for the coronavirus. More than 9,000 detainees have come up positive since testing began in February 2020.

At least nine detainees have died in custody after testing positive, although ICE says the virus is not always their official cause of death. On Saturday, a 57-year-old Mexican national died at a hospital in Georgia due to cardiopulmonary arrest -- with secondary complications from the coronavirus, ICE said Sunday.

The virus prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advise Immigration and Customs Enforcement to reduce its detainee population to 75% of normal capacity. ICE said at the end of last year it had gone further, dropping down to 70%.

Migrants caught near the border were turned back immediately at an increasing rate under Title 42, without being transferred to ICE custody.

""On March 21, 2020, CBP began implementing legal authorities held by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure that COVID-19 is not further introduced into the United States,"" CBP said in a statement Tuesday. ""Under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal border crossers are, to the maximum extent possible, immediately expelled to their country of last transit (Canada or Mexico). These illegal border crossers are not held in congregate areas for processing.""

Title 42 allows the government to turn away nearly everyone found illegally entering the country immediately – with children as the only exceptions.

The Department of Health and Human Services declined to answer whether it was conducting coronavirus testing on those children as they entered the U.S.

And one result is that some parents are sending their children across alone, knowing they won’t be deported, and then trying to sneak in themselves separately with the hope of later reuniting under the Biden administration.

The president announced this week a new task force designed to reunite children who had been separated from their families under a Trump-era zero-tolerance program with their relatives.

Critics worry that will incentivize illegal immigration.

""If you or I were to leave our child with a human trafficker and smuggler, we would lose our parental rights to that child,"" Republican Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs told Fox News Monday. ""But here we’re going to reunite them and give them legal status – that’s what we’re concerned about.""

On Tuesday, Biden signed three more executive orders on immigration. One will create a task force to reunite separated children with their families in the wake of the Trump administration’s controversial zero-tolerance policy. Another order aims to address and slow down migration across the southern border. The third will review some of former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and ""streamline"" the legal immigration process.

""I’m not making new law, I'm eliminating bad policy,"" Biden said from the Oval Office. ""What I'm doing is taking on the issues that, 99 percent of them, that the last President of the United States issued executive orders I thought were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in the area of immigration.""

Biden also said Tuesday that he expects his new Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, to work with Congress on more comprehensive immigration reforms.

2021-02-02 13:12:05+00:00,31,"As coronavirus legislation hangs in limbo, the Democratic senator from the Mountain State is under intense pressure to back the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal pushed by the Democratic-held White House and lauded by his state's Republican governor.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is a moderate with a reputation for working across party lines. And with little margin for error for Senate Democrats in a 50-50 chamber, he's being squeezed to vote with Democrats on an upcoming effort to pass coronavirus relief via budget reconciliation.

Last Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris pitched the White House's ""American Rescue Plan"" directly to West Virginians on WSAZ, a station in the Huntingdon/Charleston, W.Va., market.

""The American people deserve their leaders to step up and stand up for them,"" Harris said in the interview.

HOUSE STARTS WORK ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF TUESDAY AFTER PSAKI WARNS BIDEN WON'T 'SLOW DOWN' FOR REPUBLICANS

But in a subsequent interview with WSAZ, Manchin said he was left out of the conversation.

""I saw [the interview]. I couldn’t believe it. No one called me [about it],"" he said. ""We’re going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward, but we need to work together. That’s not a way of working together.""

Then on Monday, Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who was previously a Democrat, echoed the vice president's call for a larger stimulus package in an interview with CNN.

""Trying to be per se fiscally responsible at this point in time ... if we actually throw away some money right now, so what?"" he said. ""We have really got to move and get people taken care of.""

The governor later doubled down in an interview on MSNBC, calling on Congress to ""go big"" and continued his media tour with an interview with The Washington Post.

Manchin has been reluctant to sign on to President Joe Biden's proposal, saying stimulus payments must be more targeted.

""Sending checks to people that basically already have a check and aren't going to be able to spend that or are not going to spend it, usually are putting it in their savings account right now, that's not who we are,"" he said in an interview with CNN last month. ""We have done an awful lot of that, it's time now to target where the money goes.""

Meanwhile, a group of 10 moderate Senate Republicans is aiming to get Biden to bring down his $1.9 trillion ask and Monday put forward a plan that would cost just over $600 billion. Both the White House and the group of Republicans said a meeting on the proposal went well Monday. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that Biden ""will not slow down work on this urgent crisis response, and will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.""

Despite pressure mounting on the national and local levels – and from both sides of the aisle – on Manchin over how he'll vote if Democrats try to push through Biden's coronavirus relief proposal via budget reconciliation, he's so far not committed to doing so.

Fox News asked Manchin's office Monday whether he would commit to backing Biden's plan if it's moved via reconciliation.

""Sen. Manchin is still committed to a bipartisan path forward,"" a spokesperson responded.

The U.S. military will offer coronavirus vaccines to the 40 detainees at Gitmo, two U.S. defense officials confirmed to Fox News this week.

On Saturday, however, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said it was ""pausing the plan to move forward, as we review force protection protocols.""

PENTAGON TO OFFER COVID-19 VACCINES TO GUANTANAMO BAY PRISONERS

""It is inexcusable and un-American that President Biden is choosing to prioritize vaccinations for convicted terrorists in Gitmo over vulnerable American seniors or veterans,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY, said prior to Kirby's announcement.

Clayton Trivett Jr., a federal prosecutor trying the case against detainees alleged to have conspired in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, told defense lawyers that ""an official in the Pentagon just signed a memo approving the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine to the detainee population in Guantanamo,"" The New York Times reported.

A lack of vaccinations has reportedly made it difficult for federal prosecutors to move forward with war crimes hearings at the base.

OJ SIMPSON GETS VACCINATED AHEAD OF YOU -- AND 9/11 MASTERMIND KSM MAY TOO: REPORTS

The order was signed on Jan. 27 by Terry Adirim, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for health affairs who was sworn in as a Biden appointee on Inauguration Day, a Pentagon spokesman told the New York Post.

""It will be administered on a voluntary basis and in accordance with the department’s priority distribution plan,"" a spokesman told the outlet.

Detainees at the base include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, or KSM, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. It’s unclear how many Guantanamo inmates, if any, have been infected with COVID-19 to date. Vaccinations for medical workers and some troops stationed at the base began on Jan. 8.

But the move -- when millions of Americans remain unvaccinated -- brought immediate criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of prioritizing terrorists over law-abiding Americans.

""Nothing says #unity like letting the 9/11 mastermind & Gitmo detainees skip in front of millions of Americans for the COVID #vaccine,"" said Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C.

2021-01-29 13:52:49+00:00,56,"Johnson & Johnson on Friday said its single-shot coronavirus vaccine was 72% effective in preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 in the U.S, but fell to 66% in a larger trial conducted worldwide. The results stem from a Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial, which involved 43,783 participants.

The shot was found to be 66% effective in preventing moderate-to-severe illness in Latin America, and 57% effective in South Africa at 28 days post-vaccination. When the company only looked at severe cases, protection rose to 85%.

J&J’s vaccine differs from currently approved jabs in the U.S. in that it requires a single shot as opposed to two doses, and was created using an adenovirus rather than mRNA technology.

""Johnson & Johnson embarked on the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic a year ago, and has brought the full force of our capabilities, as well as tremendous public-private partnerships, to enable the development of a single-shot vaccine. Our goal all along has been to create a simple, effective solution for the largest number of people possible, and to have maximum impact to help end the pandemic,"" Alex Gorsky, Chairman, Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson said in a press release Friday. ""We’re proud to have reached this critical milestone and our commitment to address this global health crisis continues with urgency for everyone, everywhere.""

The company suggested the shot was safe and well-tolerated; 9% of trial participants developed a fever and there were no serious allergic reactions.

J&J also boosted hopes its vaccine candidate will be effective against variant strains.

""Protection was generally consistent across race, age groups, including adults over 60 years of age (N= 13,610), and across all variants and regions studied, including South Africa where nearly all cases of COVID-19 (95%) were due to infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant from the B.1.351 lineage,"" reads the release.

The company said it plans to file for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. in early February, with product ready to ship immediately after authorization. The company expects the vaccine to remain stable for two years at minus 20 degrees Celsius, and at least three months at 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius.

Top officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) weighed in on the results Friday. One voiced disappointment in the vaccine's efficacy compared to previously authorized shots developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which are about 95% effective against COVID-19.

COVID-19 is already widespread in the U.S., with more than 25 million cases reported to date, including more than 425,000 deaths. The new measures are designed to try to prevent travelers from bringing in newer forms of the virus that scientists say can spread more easily.

""The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning.

Hours earlier, Trump emphasized in a tweet that ""It is up to the States to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the Federal Government.

BIDEN SAYS TRUMP ADMINSTRATION'S COVID VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLNS FALLING 'FAR BEHIND'

The tweets follow President-elect Joe Biden's warning that the Trump administration's effort to vaccinate Americans against the coronavirus ""is falling behind, far behind.""

Speaking in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday after meeting virtually with advisers, Biden pledged ""a more aggressive effort"" to get the pace of vaccinations ""back on track.""

Biden said that ""as I long feared and warned, the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should. A few weeks ago the Trump administration suggested that 20 million Americans could be vaccinated by the end of December. With only a few days left in December, we've only vaccinated a few million so far.""

Trump officials leading Operation Warp Speed last week acknowledged that the vaccine rollout was ""unlikely"" to meet its goal of 20 million vaccinations by the end of the month.

Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who heads the administration's efforts to speed up vaccine production and distribution, told reporters that the process has been ""slower than we thought it would be.""

Biden said he has directed his team ""to prepare a much more aggressive effort with more federal involvement and leadership to get things back on track. We'll find ways to boost the pace of vaccinations.""

He reiterated his goal of ""ensuring that 100 million shots have been administered by the end of the first 100 days.""

A state lab informed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the presence of the strain in a man in his 20s from Elbert County. He has no travel history and is isolating himself until cleared by public health officials, Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

STEFANIK CALLS CUOMO 'ABSOLUTE DISGRACE' FOR PRIORITIZING DRUG ADDICTS FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE

""The health and safety of Coloradans is our top priority and we will closely monitor this case, as well as all COVID-19 indicators, very closely,"" Polis said. ""We are working to prevent spread and contain the virus at all levels.""

Polis said the man has no close contacts identified thus far but that public health officials were working to find others who were potentially exposed through contact tracing interviews. He said his office will monitor the new case ""very closely.""

The discovery of the new strain, called B.1.1.7, in Britain alarmed officials and led to lockdown measures and international travel restrictions in southeastern England amid the holiday season.

Researchers have identified the new strain in more than a dozen countries, including Japan, Canada and several European nations. Last week, officials in Nigeria said the new variant appears to have emerged in that country.

""There is a lot we don’t know about this new COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious,"" Polis said.

Margaret Keenan, who received her first dose on Dec. 8, returned to Coventry’s University Hospital to receive the second.

The 91-year-old, who was the first in the world to receive the jab after the U.K. leapfrogged the European Union to grant the vaccine temporary approval, had previously urged ""everybody"" to get the vaccine ""when they are asked to do so.""

""We were delighted to welcome Margaret Keenan back to Coventry’s University Hospital today to safely receive the second dose of the vaccination, after she became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 following its clinical approval,"" Professor Andy Hardy, chief executive of the hospital, said in a statement, according to Sky News.

The U.K. has enacted coronavirus-related restrictions including travel bans and stay-at-home orders in a bid to stifle another wave of infections as the positivity rates spike in several areas. The country has also identified two additional strains of the coronavirus, including one believed to be more transmissible than the others.

Pfizer has said that in its current form, the vaccine should be effective against preventing the newly identified strains, but that the ""flexibile"" technology will also allow for tweaks to be made if necessary. The vaccine, which was developed using mRNA technology and is said to be more than 90% effective in clinical trials, requires two doses that must be spaced 21 days apart.

The Los Angeles Times reported one person died from the virus every 10 minutes in the county on Christmas Eve.

Dr. Christina Ghaly, the health services director for LA County, told the paper that the worst is ""almost certainly yet to come"" due to the expected post-Christmas surge on top of the surge.

The paper reported that on Sunday, 94% of the hospitals in the county that receive patients in ambulances were forced to divert some due to spacing issues and some patients didn’t leave ambulances for up to eight hours so they could be treated inside the vehicle.

Sixty-five inmates and employees of California Health Care Facility in Stockton, volunteered to receive the vaccine Tuesday, said Steve Crouch, director of public employees for the International Union of Operating Engineers, which represents maintenance and systems employees.

The employees who received vaccinations are in high-risk positions dealing with potentially infected inmates, Crouch told the Los Angeles Times.

At least 150 of the facility’s 2,400 inmates are positive for COVID-19.

Vaccination of employees and high-risk inmates is also expected to get underway at the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla and the California Medical Facility, Vacaville, according to California Correctional Health Care Services.

""Supply of the vaccine is limited and will be distributed according to state and federal guidelines,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Our first focus will be people at high risk of becoming infected or severely ill from COVID-19.""

2020-12-24 00:24:23+00:00,122,"Socialists are evidently displeased with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ curious silence on much-needed economic relief to Americans during the pandemic.

The issue was raised Thursday on the socialist website Jacobin, with an article titled: ""Where in the World is Kamala Harris?""

The entry comes just days after Congress passed $900 billion in COVID relief. Individuals making up to $75,000 a year will receive a direct cash payment of $600 – half the amount that was provided in the previous coronavirus legislation.

The article chastised Harris for not being more vocal in demanding a higher amount for Americans hard-hit by the pandemic.

Jacobin noted that earlier in the pandemic – months before Biden picked her to be his running mate – Harris introduced coronavirus relief legislation to provide recurring $2,000 monthly payments to most Americans during the pandemic.

Harris, along with the bill’s co-sponsors Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., argued that the one-time payment of $1,200 provided in the previous coronavirus legislation, known as the CARES Act, didn’t go far enough to help families reeling from the health and financial crisis.

BIDEN'S PICK BUTTIGIEG AGREES TO LOOK FOR EMAILS RELATED TO ID CARD PROGRAM FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""The CARES Act gave Americans an important one-time payment, but it’s clear that wasn’t nearly enough to meet the needs of this historic crisis,"" said Harris, a former 2020 Democratic White House contender. ""Bills will continue to come in every single month during the pandemic and so should help from the government.""

Harris' original proposal was considered radical and an attempt to merely validate her progressive credentials. The author of the Jacobin piece surmised that Harris’ silence could indicate that the progressive causes she championed on the campaign trail – like ending private health insurance and banning fracking – could have all just been cheap talk.

The author pleaded with the Vice President-elect to take more aggressive action.

""This is her chance to lead Democrats to a big win over McConnell in support of a policy that will help millions of people,"" the author wrote. ""Let’s hope she seizes the moment and doesn’t decide to just disappear.""

""To so-called conservatives who are quick to identify the socialism of Democrats: If you vote for this spending monstrosity, you are no better,"" Paul said.

The relief package will send a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters.

Why not $2,000? Maybe these new Free-Money Republicans should join the Everybody-Gets-A-Guaranteed-Income Caucus? Why not $20,000 a year for everybody, why not $30,000? If we can print out money with impunity, why not do it?""

The Senate later aligned with the House and passed the COVID-19 relief package and government funding plan. The vote was 91-6, and members needed 60 votes to pass the bill since it skipped several parliamentary steps, Fox News’ Chad Pergram reported.

The other five who voted against the package were Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., Mike Lee, R-Utah, Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

Cruz tweeted earlier that it is ""ABSURD"" to have ""a $2.5 trillion spending bill negotiated in secret and then—hours later—demand an up-or-down vote on a bill nobody has had time to read.""

2020-12-19 00:52:06+00:00,93,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday formally granted emergency approval for Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine candidate, officially paving the way for widespread distribution of the long-awaited vaccine.

It is the second COVID-19 vaccine to receive such approval in the U.S. A week ago, the FDA granted emergency use approval to one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Distribution of that vaccine to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities began this week.

The FDA's move came just one day after an advisory panel to the agency voted to endorse the product.

The vote was 20-0. One committee member abstained.

CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN

The committee was charged with voting on the following question: ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risk for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?""

The highly anticipated meeting included members of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research advisory committee, outside vaccine experts and Moderna representatives.

Although significant, the committee’s vote in favor of emergency use authorization (EUA) was not final — the vote had to go before FDA officials, as it did Friday before widespread distribution could commence.

A similar process ensued after a panel of independent experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently voted that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be the first to receive the long-awaited coronavirus vaccine. That decision required approval from CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.

With formal FDA approval — the first such approval for Moderna — Americans could see an initial 6 million doses distributed next week.

HOW DO THE MODERNA AND PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINES COMPARE?

The FDA panel’s vote to approve the company’s EUA was expected, with documents posted ahead of the agency’s scheduled Dec. 17 meeting showing that the candidate met the FDA’s requirements for emergency use.

An FDA committee’s review of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine emergency use authorization application found ""no specific safety concerns"" in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially paving the way for a second COVID-19 jab to enter the scene.

The panel also found that the vaccine reduced the risk of confirmed COVID-19 – including severe cases – occurring at least 14 days after the second dose.

The committee was careful to note that there wasn’t enough data to evaluate the duration of protection in relation to the vaccine, effectiveness in certain high-risk populations such as immunocompromised individuals, effectiveness in individuals who have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2, or effectiveness in pediatric populations. There also wasn’t enough data for the committee to evaluate future vaccine effectiveness in relation to changes in the virus, effectiveness against asymptomatic infection, and effectiveness against long-term effects of COVID-19, effectiveness against mortality, or effectiveness against transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

DO YOU NEED A COVID-19 VACCINE IF YOU'VE ALREADY HAD THE VIRUS?

Not unlike Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, the Moderna jab did elicit non-serious adverse reactions such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and chills. The reactions were characterized as generally mild to moderate.

The FDA did consider three serious adverse reactions, including nausea and vomiting, and facial swelling. An incident of Bell’s palsy also occurred in a vaccine recipient, ""for which a causal relationship to vaccination cannot be concluded at this time.""

ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO VACCINES ARE RARE, SHORT-LIVED

From an accessibility standpoint, the Moderna vaccine, which proved more than 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials and requires two doses given weeks apart, does not require ultra-cold storage requirements as the Pfizer-BioNTech jab does.

A third candidate, from Johnson & Johnson, which would require just one dose, is working its way through the pipeline. Behind that is a candidate from AstraZeneca and Oxford University.

The FDA's advisory board vote to endorse Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine was 20-0, with one committee member abstaining.

The committee was charged with voting on the following question: ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risk for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?""

TRUMP SAYS CORONAVIRUS VACCINES WILL 'END THE PANDEMIC,' TOUTS PROGRESS ON 'MODERN-DAY MIRACLE'

Although significant, the committee’s vote in favor of emergency use authorization (EUA) is not final. The vote will now go before FDA officials who will decide whether to grant EUA based on the committee’s findings. Such approval would come about a week after the regulatory agency granted EUA to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for individuals aged 16 and older, which states have begun rolling out to health care workers this week.

An FDA committee’s review of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine emergency use authorization application found ""no specific safety concerns"" in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially paving the way for a second COVID-19 jab to enter the scene.

The panel also found that the vaccine reduced the risk of confirmed COVID-19 – including severe cases – occurring at least 14 days after the second dose.

FDA PANEL ENDORSES MODERNA VACCINE

The committee was careful to note that there wasn’t enough data to evaluate the duration of protection in relation to the vaccine, effectiveness in certain high-risk populations such as immunocompromised individuals, effectiveness in individuals who have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2, or effectiveness in pediatric populations. There also wasn’t enough data for the committee to evaluate future vaccine effectiveness in relation to changes in the virus, effectiveness against asymptomatic infection, and effectiveness against long-term effects of COVID-19, effectiveness against mortality, or effectiveness against transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Not unlike Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, the Moderna jab did elicit non-serious adverse reactions such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and chills. The reactions were characterized as generally mild to moderate.

The FDA last week approved Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, which has been distributed throughout the country to health care and front-line workers this week.

From an accessibility standpoint, the Moderna vaccine, which proved more than 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials and requires two doses given weeks apart, does not require ultra-cold storage requirements, and comes in smaller batches, compared to the 975 doses with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Upon formal FDA approval, which would mark the first such approval for Moderna, Americans could see an initial 6 million doses distributed next week.

Such approval would come about a week after the regulatory agency granted EUA to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for individuals aged 16 and older, which states have begun rolling out to health care workers this week.

A similar process ensued after a panel of independent experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently voted that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities will be the first to receive the long-awaited coronavirus vaccine. That decision required approval from CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.

The FDA panel’s vote to approve the company’s EUA was expected, with documents posted ahead of the agency’s scheduled Dec. 17 meeting showing that the candidate met the FDA’s requirements for emergency use.

""Starting next week, we will prioritize the removal of the most harmful misleading information, and during the coming weeks, begin to label Tweets that contain potentially misleading information about the vaccines,"" Twitter said. ""We are focused on mitigating misleading information that presents the biggest potential harm to people's health and wellbeing.""

Twitter added that it has ""an important role to play as a place for good faith public debate and discussion around these critical public health matters.""

Twitter’s announcement comes as health care workers throughout the nation were the first to receive Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine, after full approval by the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend.

Under the platform’s policy, Twitter requires the removal of tweets that include false or misleading information about the nature of the virus —such as how it spreads within communities — the ""efficacy and/or safety of preventative measures, treatments, or other precautions to mitigate or treat the disease, official regulations, restrictions or exemptions pertaining to health advisories, and the prevalence or risk of infection or death.""

But next week, Twitter will expand that policy and may require users to ""remove Tweets which advance harmful, false or misleading narratives about COVID-19 vaccinations.""

Twitter said posts that include ""false claims that suggest immunizations and vaccines are used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations, including statements about vaccines that invoke a deliberate conspiracy; false claims which have been widely debunked about the adverse impacts or effects of receiving vaccinations; or false claims that COVID-19 is not real or not serious, and therefore that vaccinations are unnecessary.""

Twitter told Fox News that they will begin enforcing the updated policy on Dec. 21 ""using a combination of technology and human review,"" and will continue expanding their actions in the weeks to follow.

""We will enforce this policy in close consultation with local, national and global public health authorities around the world, and will strive to be iterative and transparent in our approach,"" Twitter said Wednesday, adding that they remain ""focused on helping people find credible health information, verifying public health experts, and updating our policies in an iterative and transparent approach.""

“We’re here today because of the extraordinary medical achievement our country has delivered this week through President Trump’s ‘Operation Warp Speed,’” HHS Secretary Azar said while speaking at the “National Ceremonial COVID-19 Vaccination Kick Off Event.” “Today health care providers across America are going to work to administer vaccines to those most vulnerable, and their coworkers.”

Azar said Pfizer and BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine has been through the regulatory process and additional stringent review processes before it was granted EUA by the FDA.

CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLANS: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN

“At 95% efficacy this vaccine is extraordinary at protecting you from the virus,” he said. “Getting vaccinated will help keep you, your family and your country safe.”

Five health care workers received the first of the two-dose vaccine during the press conference. The second dose will be given in about three weeks.

All recipients, which included an anesthesiologist, several from labor and delivery units, and an emergency room physicians said the shot didn't feel any different from the ones they had received prior.

“Deliveries have begun today as we speak,"" Perna told reporters during a Monday call. ""Of the 145 shipments the Secretary [Alex Azar] referenced, we know that 55 have been received and we will track the remaining [shipments] as we go through the day... We know the shipments for tomorrow’s deliveries have been packed and checked, we’ll be managing each of those.”

The first shipments of nearly 3 million doses were said to arrive in 145 distribution centers Monday across 50 states, with an additional 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday and the remaining 66 on Wednesday.

While Monday marked the initial push, the coming days will serve as a “drumbeat of continuous execution” of Pfizer’s vaccine, Perna said.

Officials also anticipate emergency authorization of Moderna’s vaccine candidate later this week. One of the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committees, VRBPAC, as well as the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, will meet on Thursday, Dec. 17, to discuss Moderna's emergency use authorization (EUA). Perna said the plan, pending FDA approval, is to ship just short of 6 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine to 3,285 locations nationwide, in a “very similar cadence” to the distribution of Pfizer’s vaccine.

""We're hitting the initial sites Monday, follow on Tuesday and Wednesday and then by the end of the week we're just in a routine cadence of execution,"" he said.

""As the secretary said, there is not one part of this country that’s not being touched today through Wednesday,"" Perna continued. ""Everybody is receiving fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine and it's because of the commercial industry and the role they're playing in the distribution of the vaccine.""

NY GIVES FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE TO HEALTH CARE WORKER

While front line workers were among the first to receive vaccinations on Monday morning, officials expect to see vaccinations in long-term care facilities and nursing homes this week. The states direct shipments of vaccines to desired locations and, Perna said, several states already established that vaccines will go into long-term care facilities this week.

In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with Walgreens, CVS and the states, created a campaign strategy for vaccine execution in long-term health care facilities. This week will involve a scaling start into distribution, and Perna said four states are ready to go in partnership with CVS and Walgreens to start scaling vaccination.

""We know on Monday, a week from today, over 1,100 long-term care facilities and nursing homes will also begin vaccination. So, very incredibly difficult plan as we work to touch over 70,000 long-term health care facilities and nursing homes collaborated and prioritized as the states want.""

Some hurdles before vaccinations can begin in nursing homes include ensuring the right locations, facilities, obtaining patients' signed consent (thereby reaching out to families as well for approval), the correct number of doses, and vaccinating facilities' staff at the time same to ""close the bubble on each facility,"" says Perna.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar added that states are encouraged to begin vaccinations in long-term care facilities sooner if pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS are ready to go faster.

""We expect to see vaccinations in nursing homes this week, and literally then by next week these pharmacy chains will have the ability to execute vaccination programs daily in thousands of long-term care and assisted living facilities.""

The former employee, Rebekah Jones, published footage on her Twitter account which showed officers with their guns drawn entering the house. The former state employee said the officers “pointed a gun in my face” and “pointed guns at my kids” during the encounter. Jones claimed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of ordering the raid, claiming the Republican “sent the gestapo” to silence her.

“This is what happens to scientists who do their job honestly,” Jones wrote on Twitter. “This is what happens to people who speak truth to power.”

Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger confirmed officers carried out a search warrant at Jones’ home. Authorities seized computer equipment during the raid.

The complaint alleged that Jones was suspected of accessing a Department of Health messaging service without permission.

In a subsequent statement, FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen said the agency’s “investigation began last month following a complaint by Florida Department of Health that a person illegally hacked into their emergency alert system.”

“As part of our investigation, FDLE agents served a search warrant this morning at the Centerville Court residence where Ms. Jones lives after determining the home was the location that the unauthorized message was sent from,” Swearingen said. “Agents knocked and called Ms. Jones both announcing the search warrant and encouraging her to cooperate. Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents.”

“After several attempts, Ms. Jones allowed agents inside. Agents entered the home in accordance with normal protocols and seized several devices that will be forensically analyzed. At no time were weapons pointed at anyone in the home. Any evidence will be referred to the State Attorney for prosecution as appropriate,” the statement added.

Representatives for the Florida Dept. of Health and Gov. DeSantis declined further comment.

Since the raid, Jones has raised more than $200,000 through a Go Fund Me page she set up herself.

“Looks like I need a new computer and a hell of a good lawyer,” she wrote on the page. “And if the governor manages to invent something to lock me away, my family will need help. Lawyers, guards to watch over my house since police released my address, moving expenses, help my family while my husband looks for a new job in a new state. Everything leftover will go to a fund to help defend whistle blowers.”

The page included a Twitter link to a clip showing Jones during an appearance on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time.""

“DeSantis needs to worry less about what I’m writing about and more about the people who are sick and dying in his state,” Jones tells CNN host Chris Cuomo.

On Tuesday, a Republican attorney in Florida who was appointed by DeSantis resigned from a state judicial panel in protest over the raid on Jones’ home. In his resignation letter, Ron Filipkowski, who served on a nominating commission for the state’s 12th Circuit, called the raid by several armed officers “unconscionable” and argued that DeSantis was likely aware of the operation.

He said recent events regarding “public access to truthful data on the pandemic,” as well as the treatment of Jones, “has made the issue now a legal one rather than just medical.”

Jones, a data scientist, was fired from her role at the department of health in May. She has claimed that her dismissal was a result of her refusal to alter data related to COVID-19 cases in the state.

DeSantis denied that Jones was a “chief architect” of Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard. The governor’s office said Jones was fired for insubordination.

""Rebekah Jones exhibited a repeated course of insubordination during her time with the department, including her unilateral decisions to modify the department's COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors,” a representative for DeSantis told the Miami Herald at the time of her firing.

Since her firing, Jones utilized a crowdfunding campaign to launch her own version of a Florida COVID-19 case tracker.

2020-12-05 02:31:21+00:00,46,"The Wikipedia page for President-elect Joe Biden’s new COVID-19 czar Jeff Zients has been scrubbed of material that could portray him as not progressive enough, Politico first reported.

Zients, a business and management executive, was tapped Thursday to serve as the White House’s COVID-19 coordinator. Zients will be tasked with overseeing the rollout of the vaccine and mobilizing economic aid, among other priorities.

Under President Obama, Zients served as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Democratic consulting firm Saguaro Strategies scrubbed the page over the summer and fall as Zients’ profile rose after he joined the Biden transition team. The firm made the changes using the name “Saguarostrat,” with the intent to clean up anything that could be politically damaging. A Saguaro Strategies staffer confirmed to Politico that the Wikipedia account was linked to the firm. After Politico reached out, the username was changed to Cactus78910.

BIDEN URGES TAKING CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, WEARING MASKS BUT SAYS THEY SHOULDN'T BE MANDATORY

One chief executive on former President Obama’s jobs council remarked that he thought Zients, then a top Obama aide, was a Republican, his Wiki page used to read. The section has been deleted.

Politico reports that one section -- where Zients spoke highly of the management consulting firm Bain -- was removed but as of this writing it has returned. Zients reportedly ""fell in love with Bain's culture, teamwork … and analytical rigor,” the section reads.

TULSI GABBARD URGES SENATE TO VOTE 'NO' ON THIS CABINET PICK

The firm also added that Zients left Facebook over “over differences with company leadership over governance and its policies around political discourse.” Zients has never said that publicly.

At the top of the section about Zients’ role advocating for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has seen left-wing opposition, the firm added Zients’ argument that it was “the most progressive trade agreement there’s ever been.”

As of this writing, that section has been removed.

Zients’ promotion of the TPP quotes him as saying: ""[t]hink of TPP as tax cuts … it cuts tariffs and sweeps away barriers to trade.”

A sudden scrubbing of someone’s Wikipedia page is not uncommon for individuals angling for a high-profile post. In June, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ Wikipedia page was scrubbed more than any other vice presidential contender and the majority of edits were made by a single person, The Intercept reported.

WestExec Advisors removed mention of its China-related work from its website just before Biden became the nominee. Several of Biden’s cabinet picks have worked for the firm, including its co-founder, Anthony Blinken, who is the nominee for secretary of state, and a former WestExec principal, Avril Haines, who is the nominee for director of national intelligence.

Web archives show that as recently as late July, the firm was touting its success in helping U.S. research universities accept donations from China, expand foreign research collaboration, and welcome foreign students in key STEM programs while remaining a “trusted partner for (Department of Defense) -sponsored research grants.”

In early August, the firm said it had helped a leading American pharmaceutical company and a multibillion-dollar American technology company gain market access to China.

Interpol said it alerted law enforcement across its 194 member countries about the threat. The agency warned the vaccines could be threatened both physically and online, Reuters reported.

""As governments are preparing to roll out vaccines, criminal organizations are planning to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains,"" said Interpol secretary general Juergen Stock. ""Criminal networks will also be targeting unsuspecting members of the public via fake websites and false cures, which could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives.""

PFIZER AND BIONTECH'S COVID-19 VACCINE WINS UK AUTHORIZATION -- FIRST IN THE WES

The warning comes as drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech announced Wednesday that they won permission for emergency use of their COVID-19 vaccine in Britain.

The move allowed Britain to become one of the first countries to begin vaccinating its population.

“The vaccine will be made available across the U.K. from next week,'' the Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement. The National Health Service ""has decades of experience in delivering large scale vaccination programs and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.''

In the U.S., the two-shot vaccine is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where a similar authorization could come later this month. The vaccine could then be rolled out by the end of the year.

Meanwhile, Homeland Security investigators are currently working with Pfizer, Moderna, and dozens of other drug companies racing to complete and distribute the vaccine and treatments for the virus, with the goal of preparing Americans for potential upcoming scams.

CORONAVIRUS VACCINE SHOULD GO TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS, LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES FIRST, CDC PANEL RECOMMENDS

“We're all very excited about the potential vaccine and treatments,” said Steve Francis, assistant director for global trade investigations with Homeland Security Investigations. “But I also caution against these criminal organizations and individuals that will try to exploit the American public.""

The coronavirus has prompted a series of criminal activities this year, including phony personal protective equipment, false cures, and extortion schemes.

As of Wednesday morning, the virus has infected at least 63,938,037 total people across the globe, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,481,750, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

2020-12-02 01:27:17+00:00,174,"Republican lawmakers condemned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after Democratic leadership announced that a bill to federally legalize marijuana will hit the House floor Wednesday.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the chamber will be considering multiple bills, including the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, and voting will take place Wednesday through Friday.

Another bill that will be reviewed, seeks to ban breeding and private ownership of big cats, which were featured in the Netflix docuseries “Tiger King” earlier this year.

BIDEN SAYS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE DURING LAME-DUCK PERIOD LIKELY 'JUST A START'

But Republican’s, many of whom are staunch critics of marijuana legalization despite it being legal in many of their states, took to Twitter to accuse Pelosi, D-Calif., of prioritizing “cannabis and cats” over finding a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill.

“This week, your House Democrat majority is tackling the tough issues by holding a vote on legalizing pot and banning tiger ownership,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote Monday on Twitter. “Nothing for small businesses. Nothing for re-opening schools. Nothing on battling the pandemic. Just cannabis and cats.”

Though while the House will not be voting on COVID-19 relief funding this week, the speaker said she spoke with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about the “bipartisan progress” that has been made in finding a solution, which attempts the marry both the Democrats and Republican’s stubborn demands.

A coronavirus stimulus package has been held up for months largely because Democrats are seeking a roughly $2.2 trillion package, while Republicans do not want to spend more than $500 billion on aid, which is an impasse that has resulted in the rejection of several relief packages from both sides of the aisle.

After speaking with President-elect Joe Biden, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have said it is a priority to get a stimulus package passed during Congress’ lame-duck session.

“Secretary Mnuchin said he would be reviewing the proposal Leader Schumer and I made to Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy last night and the bipartisan Senate proposal unveiled today,” Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday night. “Additional COVID relief is long overdue and must be passed in this lame duck session.""

The decision to vote on the MORE Act is not as unexpected as some Republican lawmakers apparently believe it to be, as it was on the chamber's docket in September.

MCCONNELL PLANS FOR NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SIGN INTO LAW

But some centrist-Democratic lawmakers feared that passing the federal legalization of weed prior to the election, when COVID-19 legislation had failed, may play badly with voters, the Marijuana Movement reported earlier this year.

“The MORE Act remains a critical component of House Democrats’ plan for addressing systemic racism and advancing criminal justice reform, and we are committed to bringing it to the Floor for a vote before the end of the year,” Hoyer said in a statement, according to the publication. “Right now, the House is focused relentlessly on securing agreement to stave off a damaging government shutdown and continuing to do its job addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Though congressional Republicans largely remain opposed to legalizing marijuana, two staunchly conservative states voted to legalize the plant for medical use on Election Day.

Mississippi and South Dakota passed legislation that permits the medicinal use of marijuana, joining 34 other states.

But South Dakota also joined Arizona, New Jersey and Montana in allowing adults to possess marijuana for recreational use – making 15 states that now permit possession, reported USA Today.

Fox News obtained an internal CDC document on Tuesday which outlined the proposed changes. A source told Fox News that the changes have been discussed with and approved by the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

DR. SCOTT ATLAS RESIGNS AS SPECIAL ADVISER TO TRUMP ON CORONAVIRUS

The CDC is expected to release the revised guidance on Wednesday, a source told Fox News.

“Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they have the virus,” the document states. “CDC and other scientists have explored changing the current recommendation to quarantine for 14 days.”

“Reducing the length of quarantine may increase compliance by reducing economic hardship,” the document continues. “In addition, the reduction in time will lessen stress on the public health system, especially when new infections are rapidly rising.”

The document states that “based on local resources, quarantine can end on Day 7 after receiving a negative test result” or on “Day 10 without testing.”

“After stopping quarantine, you should: watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure; if you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider; wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the document states.

The document adds, however, that the CDC “continues to recommend quarantine for 14 days to more completely reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.”

“CDC recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus,” the document states. “These recommendations are based on what we know now.”

The document added that: “CDC will continue to evaluate new information and update recommendations as needed.”

COVID-19 VACCINES WILL BE READY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF FDA APPROVAL, AZAR SAYS

A senior administration official told Fox News that the revised guidance is “long overdue,” and “something that should have happened sooner.”

The official told Fox News that the CDC's revised recommendations were guided by extensive modeling studies by CDC scientists, as well as scientists from outside the agency. The official said that the risk of COVID transmission remains the ""lowest with 14 days of quarantine,"" but that the new options introduce an estimated 1% ""residual risk"" if quarantine is shorted to 10 days, and 5% residual risk of quarantine is reduced to 7 days, if you also add a test.

The official said that the ""small amount of increased risk"" with these new options ""needs to be weighed against the benefits of reduced economic hardship, reduced stress on the public health system, and better compliance with quarantine and contact tracing that could improve overall control of new infections.""

The revised guidance, expected to be announced on Wednesday, comes as the Trump administration said deliveries of a COVID-19 vaccine will begin as early as this week, and would be available first for front-line workers, medical personnel and senior citizens.

Next week, regulators at the Food and Drug Administration are expected to review Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine developed with BioNTech.

The latest trial data for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine, unveiled earlier this month, showed it was 90% effective.

In addition, Moderna said its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19. AstraZeneca also reported preliminary results that showed its vaccine efficacy ranged from 62% to 90%, depending on the dosage amount given to participants.

According to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the vaccines will be “shipped” within 24 hours of FDA approval and then it would be up to “nursing homes, hospitals, and pharmacies to get that dispensed.”

“It really could be within days of FDA approval we’ll start seeing vaccines in people’s arms which is frankly incredible,” Azar said Monday.

""Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals.

""Additionally, the data show that an initial booster dose is critical in helping to protect all adults from the potentially severe outcomes of COVID-19.

Previously, the FDA had cleared fourth doses only for people 12 and older who have severely weakened immune systems.

The Washington Post reported last week that preliminary Customs and Border Protection data indicate that authorities are on track to have encountered more than 200,000 in March, compared to 173,277 in March 2021.

Musk previously tested positive for the virus in November 2020 before a vaccine was available. At the time, he said he tested himself four times on the same day, with two tests showing positive results.

Musk has voiced opposition to vaccine mandates and has downplayed the pandemic in the past, at one point feuding with local officials in California over stay-at-home orders.

He defied an order to keep his Tesla factory closed and eventually moved the company headquarters from Silicon Valley to a location just outside Austin, Texas.

The electric automaker has suspended production in its Shanghai factory for four days after the city announced a two-stage lockdown amid a surge in COVID-19 cases.

In a December 2021 Time interview after he was selected as the magazine's ""Person of the Year,"" Musk said that he and his eligible children are all vaccinated because the science is ""unequivocal"" but said he is opposed to mandates.

2022-03-28 17:35:00+00:00,24,"The masks come off. The office opens up. The COVID coffers dwindle.



But the latter may be a problem.



Yes, Congress spent nearly $5 trillion on COVID since the beginning of the pandemic. But Congress ripped $15 billion in coronavirus health funds out of a big, omnibus spending bill to fund the government earlier this month.



Meantime, cases surge in the United Kingdom and China. There’s been an extraordinary bounce in cases among lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol. Twenty members of Congress have tested positive this month alone. There’s worry about another wave of cases in the United States as the omicron BA.2 variant spreads. Top White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci doubts there will be a serious surge. But it’s all unclear.



The Biden administration is imploring lawmakers to approve the new COVID money. The White House says the government lacks the money to fund distribution of a potential fourth booster if it’s mandated. No new money means no free tests. No free therapeutics. No free vaccines.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS COVID-19 MONEY ON 'EMPTY' AS IT TIES APPROVAL TO UKRAINE AID

People will have to pony up the cash out of their own pocketbook to pay for vaccines and medicine. And what happens if you’re supposed to send your kid to a summer camp that requires tests? Or attend a friend’s birthday party at a public venue that requires a test? Or attend a sporting event or concert that requires a test?

Americans will have to pay on their own – right as inflation climbs and gas prices remain high. So paying for a test becomes a de facto tax.



""Whether it’s a wedding or a business conference or whatever people enjoy doing, a test on the front end can help someone potentially prevent a spread,"" said Dr. Shawn Naqvi, of Personic Health Care in Virginia. ""I can’t emphasize enough the need for more federal funding so we can offer this on a free basis to everyone who is in need.""

Naqvi’s not the only one calling on Congress to act.



After Congress stripped the funding, Fauci told a Washington Post forum it was ""really extraordinary, particularly given what we’ve been through.""



White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients publicly fretted about what the lack of funding meant if the pandemic took a turn for the worse and vaccines are needed.



""Because it takes months to ramp back up to rebuild capacity, failure to invest now will leave us with insufficient testing, capacity and supply,"" said Zients. ""We urgently need additional funding from Congress to continue our fight against COVID.""

Congressional leaders from both parties were stunned when a coalition of lawmakers objected to its inclusion of the coronavirus money in the omnibus spending package. The lawmakers balked at the fact that Congress would pay for the COVID money by slashing previously approved coronavirus cash, tagged for their states and districts.

""It is heartbreaking,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., when forced to remove the COVID money from the bill in order to avoid a government shutdown.



Pelosi then in a private meeting verbally upbraided Democrats who forced leaders to yank the COVID health aid.



""What is your message to those colleagues who nitpick over that?"" asked Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News.



""I’ve communicated my message to them,"" replied a steely Pelosi, drawing a laugh from the Capitol Hill press corps.



The speaker added that Congress must offset whatever COVID money was needed.



But passing a bill with more COVID aid is a tough sell. There’s pandemic fatigue. Some Democrats are leery of the optics of the pandemic continuing as the midterm elections creep closer. Parliamentarily, it was easiest to load up the COVID money onto the omnibus spending bill. The COVID money would ride along everything else in that massive, $1.5 trillion bill to fund the entire government. But now, Congress must likely tackle it as a standalone. Such a prospect may not be a problem in the House. But the Senate is another issue. Any bill there is subject to a filibuster. And, it takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.



House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., indicates the House will tackle a prospective COVID bill in the next few weeks. But Hoyer intimated the legislation must wade its way through the Senate first.

HOYER TELLS DEMOCRATS TO PREPARE FOR NEW COVID RELIEF BILL

Then there’s another problem: politics.

Republicans have long railed against Democrats approving their own, $1.9 trillion bill a year ago on a partisan basis. The GOP contends the measure included a lot of extraneous provisions that amounted to a left-wing wish list which had little to do with COVID. Republicans argue that bill is partly to blame for fueling inflation, flushing the economy with too much cash.



So, heading into the midterms, Republicans have a plan to extract a pound of flesh from Democrats to get COVID help this time. And, they want to lord last March’s partisan coronavirus bill over the heads of Democrats.



""Be totally transparent with where that $1.9 trillion went,"" said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. ""Let’s see what’s left and see if we couldn’t find some money to pay for whatever the administration would like to do next.""



Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., quickly pointed to what he characterized as ""unspent money"" as the source to plus-up COVID accounts to deal with health issues.



""The money is there and should be reprogrammed and that’s the way forward,"" said McConnell.



""Reprogramming"" money to cover current pandemic health needs likely needs congressional approval. And Republicans are focused on trying to make Democrats take it on the chin – extracting money from Democratic priorities passed in the $1.9 trillion bill – just to address COVID preparedness now.



Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the White House had not yet ""laid out a specific plan"" for the new COVID needs.



""I think the administration has to be more forthcoming with the information and justifications and offsets,"" said Collins. ""One area where I do think there is going to be a need is in testing.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wasn’t ready to agree to McConnell’s proposal of taking money from other COVID pots. Schumer just said he was working with Republicans to find a way to prevent the COVID fiscal cliff.



""This is really crucial. Anyone who tries to block this, God forbid we have a second variant and we don’t have enough of the therapeutics, enough of the testing, enough of the vaccines. (They’re) going to regret it,"" said Schumer. ""We hope to get it done.""

The Senate devolved into wild, verbal brawling two years ago this month in an effort to pass the staggering $2.2 trillion ""CARES"" Act to address coronavirus at the outset of the pandemic. The measure proved to be the most sweeping piece of legislation in American history.



Congress finally approved the package after days of consternation.



Two years later, the pandemic isn’t over. Yet the White House and even Republican lawmakers are still fighting over money.

2022-03-26 22:04:19+00:00,44,"Children continue to be impacted by learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures, a new report shows.

Students fared worse academically during the second year of the pandemic compared to the first year, when students earned lower scores than they did prior to the pandemic.

The trend suggests the impact of COVID-19 closures on student success continues to be felt, according to a study released Wednesday by education software company Renaissance Learning.

""All signs suggest that this is going to be a multiyear recovery,"" Gene Kerns, vice president and chief academic officer at Renaissance, said in a statement.

""We can reset instruction back to where it was pre-pandemic, but that isn’t going to instantly move students up to where they would have been had the pandemic not occurred,"" Kerns said. ""For example, if you worked out every day and then stopped for two years, you aren’t going to be in the same shape as before the break when you return to the gym. We know what to do — and educators are rising to meet this great challenge — but it’s going to take time.""

Renaissance's results are based on an analysis of standardized test scores for early literacy, reading or math during both the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 academic years. The company's analysis included 4.4 million early literacy or reading assessments at 19,046 schools and 2.9 million math assessments at 12,754 schools, covering K-12 students in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

JOHNS HOPKINS STUDY REIGNITES COVID LOCKDOWN DEBATE

For students in first grade or below, reading results were ""concerning,"" according to Renaissance, which noted that school closures may have disrupted foundational reading skills for students around the ages of five and six. Early literacy scores for pre-readers at this grade level were 19 points lower on average this fall and 17 points lower in the winter, the study shows.

Scores for independent readers at the first-grade level — or first-grade students who can read on their own — were 24 points lower in the fall and eight points lower in the winter, suggesting that pre-readers may have fallen further behind their peers who can read.

PARENTS, ACTIVISTS HOPE STUDENTS CAN OVERCOME COVID DISRUPTIONS: ‘THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO ARE BEHIND’

While there were slight improvements in fourth- and fifth-grade students this winter compared to last winter, math skills in middle and high school students have fallen significantly compared to pre-pandemic years.

Overall, however, students in all grades K-12 registered lower scores in math and reading during the 2021-2022 school year compared to the same period last year and prior to COVID-19.

Meanwhile, student growth percentiles (SGPs), which measure how well students perform compared to their peers, are higher so far in 2021-2022 compared to 2020-2021.

Median SGP points increased three points to 48 and 50 in math and reading, respectively, but for ""widespread recovery to be underway, we would need to see SGPs consistently well above 50, the threshold for typical pre-pandemic growth,"" the study notes. Few grades have surpassed 50 points over the last year.

Students in first grade, however, were still struggling with low-growth percentages in the 2021-2022 school year, which researchers attributed to three factors: starting kindergarten in 2020 when many schools were closed, data coming exclusively from in-school tests rather than a mix of in-school and remote records and an increased number of student test scores submitted this year.

At the same time, states across the country have been experiencing teacher shortages across all grade levels and especially in special education since the pandemic began.

FAUCI SAYS HE DOES NOT ANTICIPATE MAJOR COVID-19 SURGE IN US

However, the publication noted that ""major uncertainties have complicated the decision,"" including how long the protection from the second booster would last, as well as how to present the White House's overall goal to the public.

Politico reported Wednesday that the booster could be recommended for adults 65 and older and that health officials have reviewed recent data showing vaccine effectiveness waning.

Additionally, there's the question of timing and whether to wait until a potential new variant-fueled wave threatens the U.S. – especially as pandemic relief funds dwindle.

In an interview last Monday on ""In the Bubble with Andy Slavitt,"" White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said there is currently no funding for fourth doses.

""Right now, we don’t have enough money for fourth doses, if they’re called for – booster shots, additional booster shots for all Americans. We don't have the funding, if we were to need a variant-specific vaccine in the future. Immediately, we don't have money to order more of the very effective monoclonal treatments,"" he said.

CDC SAYS OMICRON SUB-VARIANT BA.2 ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 35% OF COVID-19 VARIANTS IN US

""Already, we've had to cut back allocations to our state partners by 30%, so we preserve the inventory that we do have,"" Zients added, calling on Congress to take action.

That said, The Times reported that people familiar with the deliberations said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could authorize a second COVID-19 booster as soon as early next week.

Although studies have found that COVID-19 vaccines are less effective against the omicron variant of concern, they still provide strong protection against severe disease and early research indicates they appear just as effective against the BA.2 sub-variant spreading across the globe.

And, while Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech have requested emergency authorization of second booster shots – Moderna's for all adults – The Times wrote that no meetings of FDA or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory committees are scheduled ahead of the purported decision.

Visitors to Washington, D.C. haven’t been welcomed into the national landmark since the capitol closed its doors to the public two years ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a memo sent to lawmakers on Wednesday, House Sergeant-at-Arms William J. Walker and Capitol attending physician Brian P. Monahan described a phased reopening plan that requires visitors to register in advance for limited guided tours.

TEXAS MAN BIKES AROUND PERIMETER OF LONE STAR STATE IN 58 DAYS

For the first phase, the U.S. Capitol will allow member-led and staff-led tours with a maximum of 15 guests per tour guide. School group tours for students enrolled in K-12 will also be allowed to visit on a limited basis as well.

Tour reservations are required for select time slots before entry can be granted. Reservations must be submitted through the Capitol’s online Congressional Tour Scheduler.

The tours will take place Monday to Friday and tour guides will only take visitors down approved tour routes.

So far, the Capitol Visitor Center’s gift shop will be open during phase one, but the House Gallery will remain closed.

THESE FOLKS LIVE IN VANS — HERE'S THEIR LIST FOR ULTIMATE ROAD TRIP ESSENTIALS

Dome tours are expected to resume on April 25 with a maximum tour limit of eight guests per member tour guide.

Phase two of the Capitol’s reopening is tentatively set for May 30, which aims to make the Capitol Visitor Center accessible to a limited number of guests along with ""other areas"" like the Capitol Visitor Center Restaurant.

The Capitol’s phased reopening to the public is a collaborative effort between Congressional leadership, the U.S. Capitol Police Board, the attending physician, Capitol Visitor Services and the U.S. Capitol Police, according to the ""Resumption of Limited Capitol Tours"" memo.

""We appreciate your continued patience and cooperation as we work together to resume public tours of the Capitol for the American people in a way that protects the health and safety of visitors and institutional staff alike,"" the joint memo states.

Tours will be monitored by Visitor Services in case modifications are needed.

The White House said it will end the reimbursement program, which was set up in March 2020 under then-President Trump, because it has exhausted its funding. Money from the program went toward paying hospitals and other health care providers for the treatment, testing and vaccination of those without insurance, regardless of immigration status.

THESE STATES ROLLED BACK THEIR GASOLINE TAXES. OTHERS COULD FOLLOW

""Providers will no longer be able to submit claims for providing these services to uninsured individuals, forcing providers to either absorb the cost or turn away people who are uninsured, increasing the disparity in access to critically needed health care and putting additional burdens on safety net providers,"" the White House said in a statement last week.

Over the course of two years, the program paid out more than $18 billion to providers for testing, treating or vaccinating uninsured people, with $11.4 billion going toward covering testing, $5.8 billion to treatment and $1.6 billion to vaccinations.

Americans without insurance will have until April 5 to receive the vaccination for free, at which point the Health Resources and Service Administration stops accepting reimbursement claims. The program stopped accepting claims for the treatment and testing of uninsured people on Tuesday.

The White House and hospitals have urged lawmakers to approve more funding for the program.

Earlier this month, Biden team officials urged Congress to allocate another $22.8 billion in emergency funding for COVID-19 response measures, including funding the reimbursement program and replenishing supplies of vaccines and antibody drugs, warning of ""severe consequences"" if lawmakers failed to do so.

""Inaction will set us back in this fight, leave us less prepared, and cost us more lives,"" the White House said.

Congress failed to do so, however, when Republicans and Democrats hit an impasse over how to pay for the proposal: GOP lawmakers wanted to repurpose COVID-19 relief money that states had not yet spent, while Democrats balked at the idea.

There are roughly 28 millions who do not have health insurance, according to the Census Bureau.

Without the reimbursement program, the medical bills for uninsured COVID-19 patients hinges on the hospital prices – which often vary dramatically – and federal aid qualifications.

""We support the administration’s request for additional funding to ensure that the health care system has the resources it needs to continue to care for patients, especially as we continue to manage COVID-19 in communities across the nation,"" said Molly Smith, vice president of policy for the American Hospital Association.

Speaking on an episode of ""In the Bubble with Andy Slavitt,"" recorded Monday, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients explained that emergency funding is urgently needed for America's continued pandemic response.

MODERNA EXPANDS COVID-19 VACCINES TO TREAT RELATED ILLNESSES

""Right now, we don’t have enough money for fourth doses, if they’re called for – booster shots, additional booster shots for all Americans. We don't have the funding, if we were to need a variant-specific vaccine in the future. Immediately, we don't have money to order more of the very effective monoclonal treatments,"" he said.

""Already, we've had to cut back allocations to our state partners by 30%, so we preserve the inventory that we do have,"" Zients added.

The administration has been leaning on Congress to take action and pass billions of dollars of coronavirus aid.

Both Republicans and Democrats have refused to bite, ejecting COVID-19 funding from the $1.5 trillion spending bill signed earlier this month.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has called on the Biden administration to double an initial request for $22.5 billion.

""It's really Congress' job now to provide those funds, to pass the $22.5 billion in emergency funds so that we can continue to keep Americans protected, prepare for whatever the virus could bring in the future and continue our efforts to vaccinate the world,"" Zients said.

""And, without funding, we will be unprepared for that possibility of increased cases in severity and hospitalizations,"" he told Slavitt.

As cases and deaths have fallen and states and cities – as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – have moved to ease or remove restrictions, the pandemic continues.

An increased spread of the BA.2 omicron sub-variant, which is in all 50 U.S. states, has led to spikes in Europe and Asia.

Scientists have warned about the possibility of surges and new variants threatening what many hoped could be a return to ""normal,"" but Zients said that the virus ""knows no borders.""

BA.2, he said, serves as a ""reminder"" that coronavirus is unpredictable and that we risk having good testing capacity if Congress fails to act.

""It's really important that we invest now, have the tools and be prepared for any possibility,"" he urged, noting that either the bill needs to be passed on an emergency basis or offsets need to be found soon.

Zients – who is stepping down from his position in April – said 93% of money allocated for direct COVID-19 response has been spent.

""Right now, we’re going to take some complaints,"" Adams said during a Tuesday morning press conference. ""But when this is all said and done, people are going to realize this is a thoughtful administration and we got it right. So baseball, basketball, businesses, all of those things, they have to wait until that layer comes.""

Adams’ comments came as he announced that masks will be optional for daycare students between the ages of 2 and 4 starting on April 4.

The Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks, New York Yankees, and New York Mets are all waiting on a rollback of the private employer vaccine mandate, which does not allow employees to work — or play for their teams — if they are not vaccinated against COVID-19.

OutKick reported last week that the same mandate keeping unvaccinated Nets star Kyrie Irving off the court will keep unvaccinated Yankees and Mets players off the field.

""We’re going to do it in the right way,"" Adams said. ""We’re going to follow the science … we’re going to make the right decision. And in New York, no matter what you do, this is 8.8 million people and 30 million opinions, so you’re never going to satisfy New Yorkers, so you must go with the logic, your heart and the science.""

Just days ago, OutKick’s Nick Geddes reported that Adams said he will not be influenced by professional sports schedules in altering the private sector mandate that prohibits unvaccinated athletes from playing in home games.

""We’re going to slowly peel back, as I stated over and over again, we’re going to do it layer by layer and each layer we peel back we’re going to do an analysis: Are we ok?"" Adams said. ""And if we have to pivot and shift and come back here in a week and say we’re going to do something different, we’re going to do that. I’m not going to hesitate to say this is where the numbers are taking us, this is where the science is and this is what we’re going to do. Because I’m not going to only view this from where we are in the crisis, I see myself out of crisis.

""And people are going to look back later like they did with the schools, remember what they did to us when we were talking about keeping the schools open — I said don’t worry about the noise, team, we’re going to do the right thing for our children and people are going to look back later and say, ‘You know what? We don’t want to admit it, but this administration got it right, and they’re going to do that again.'""

Adams said he’s gotten feedback from local businesses is that they are thankful the mandate has remained in place.

2022-03-23 00:00:01+00:00,19,"Alcohol-related deaths increased during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to researchers.

In a study published earlier this month, authors from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that the number and rate of deaths increased approximately 25% between 2019 and 2020 – from 78,927 to 99,017.

ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CAN DIRECTLY CAUSE CANCER, STUDY SAYS

In addition, alcohol-related deaths accounted for 2.8% of all deaths in 2019 and 3% in 2020.

Although the alcohol deaths rose for everybody, people ages 25 to 44 experienced the greatest increases in alcohol-related deaths in 2020.

The rates of deaths increased before the pandemic, but less rapidly.

The rate increase for alcohol-related deaths in 2020 outpaced the increase in all-cause mortality, which was 16.6%.

The institute – a division of the National Institutes of Health – used U.S. mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics to compare the numbers and rates of alcohol-related and all-cause deaths among all individuals 16 years or older in 2019 and 2020.

Provisional data for the first half of 2021 were also obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research.

RISING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROJECTED TO CAUSE MORE LIVER DISEASE, DEATHS

Deaths were identified as alcohol-related if an alcohol-induced cause was listed as an underlying or contributing cause.

In 2020, 2,042 death certificates listed alcohol and COVID-19 as causes.

Opioid overdose deaths involving alcohol as a contributing cause increased by more than 40% and there was a 59.2% increase in which alcohol contributed to overdoses specifically on synthetic opioids other than methadone.

The authors said that possible reasons these deaths increased include pandemic-related stressors, shifting alcohol policies and disrupted treatment access.

Limitations to the study include inaccurate death certificates and unclear causal relationships among listed causes of deaths.

""Whether alcohol-related deaths will decline as the pandemic wanes, and whether policy changes could help reduce such deaths, warrants consideration,"" the authors wrote.

Dr. Aaron White, the study's first author and a scientific adviser at the institute, said that available data for 2021 indicates that alcohol-related deaths remained elevated.

2022-03-22 20:00:00+00:00,15,"New York City mayor Eric Adams said the city’s professional sports teams are going to have to wait their turn when it comes to vaccination-mandate rollbacks.

""Right now, we’re going to take some complaints,"" Adams said during a Tuesday morning press conference. ""But when this is all said and done, people are going to realize this is a thoughtful administration and we got it right. So baseball, basketball, businesses, all of those things, they have to wait until that layer comes.""

Adams’ comments came as he announced that masks will be optional for daycare students between the ages of 2 and 4 starting on April 4.

The Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks, New York Yankees, and New York Mets are all waiting on a rollback of the private employer vaccine mandate, which does not allow employees to work — or play for their teams — if they are not vaccinated against COVID-19.

OutKick reported last week that the same mandate keeping unvaccinated Nets star Kyrie Irving off the court will keep unvaccinated Yankees and Mets players off the field.

""We’re going to do it in the right way,"" Adams said. ""We’re going to follow the science … we’re going to make the right decision. And in New York, no matter what you do, this is 8.8 million people and 30 million opinions, so you’re never going to satisfy New Yorkers, so you must go with the logic, your heart and the science.""

Just days ago, OutKick’s Nick Geddes reported that Adams said he will not be influenced by professional sports schedules in altering the private sector mandate that prohibits unvaccinated athletes from playing in home games.

""We’re going to slowly peel back, as I stated over and over again, we’re going to do it layer by layer and each layer we peel back we’re going to do an analysis: Are we ok?"" Adams said. ""And if we have to pivot and shift and come back here in a week and say we’re going to do something different, we’re going to do that. I’m not going to hesitate to say this is where the numbers are taking us, this is where the science is and this is what we’re going to do. Because I’m not going to only view this from where we are in the crisis, I see myself out of crisis.

""And people are going to look back later like they did with the schools, remember what they did to us when we were talking about keeping the schools open — I said don’t worry about the noise, team, we’re going to do the right thing for our children and people are going to look back later and say, ‘You know what? We don’t want to admit it, but this administration got it right, and they’re going to do that again.'""

Adams said he’s gotten feedback from local businesses is that they are thankful the mandate has remained in place.

""Believe it or not, a lot of our businesses, they love the mandates,"" Adams said. ""When I speak to a lot of my businesses, getting people back in the office, that mandate is allowing them to feel safe in the office for those who feel that they would rather the vaccine mandate to be in place. But again, we’re going to do it in layers, and when we feel it’s the right time to look at that, if we do so at all, because the work environment is an important environment, we’re going to make that determination.

2022-03-22 18:00:01+00:00,14,"Alcohol-related deaths increased during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to researchers.

In a study published earlier this month, authors from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that the number and rate of deaths increased approximately 25% between 2019 and 2020 – from 78,927 to 99,017.

ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CAN DIRECTLY CAUSE CANCER, STUDY SAYS

In addition, alcohol-related deaths accounted for 2.8% of all deaths in 2019 and 3% in 2020.

Although the alcohol deaths rose for everybody, people ages 25 to 44 experienced the greatest increases in alcohol-related deaths in 2020.

The rates of deaths increased before the pandemic, but less rapidly.

The rate increase for alcohol-related deaths in 2020 outpaced the increase in all-cause mortality, which was 16.6%.

The institute – a division of the National Institutes of Health – used U.S. mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics to compare the numbers and rates of alcohol-related and all-cause deaths among all individuals 16 years or older in 2019 and 2020.

Provisional data for the first half of 2021 were also obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research.

RISING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROJECTED TO CAUSE MORE LIVER DISEASE, DEATHS

Deaths were identified as alcohol-related if an alcohol-induced cause was listed as an underlying or contributing cause.

In 2020, 2,042 death certificates listed alcohol and COVID-19 as causes.

Opioid overdose deaths involving alcohol as a contributing cause increased by more than 40% and there was a 59.2% increase in which alcohol contributed to overdoses specifically on synthetic opioids other than methadone.

The authors said that possible reasons these deaths increased include pandemic-related stressors, shifting alcohol policies and disrupted treatment access.

Limitations to the study include inaccurate death certificates and unclear causal relationships among listed causes of deaths.

""Whether alcohol-related deaths will decline as the pandemic wanes, and whether policy changes could help reduce such deaths, warrants consideration,"" the authors wrote.

Dr. Aaron White, the study's first author and a scientific adviser at the institute, said that available data for 2021 indicates that alcohol-related deaths remained elevated.

""Maybe they’ll go back down,"" he told The New York Times on Tuesday, ""but this could be the new norm.""",FoxNews,"['data', 'covid19', 'study', 'deaths', 'cause', 'increased', 'pandemic', 'listed', 'jumped', 'alcohol', 'national', 'alcoholrelated']",0

The head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden commented on a possible future surge in the United States due to Omicron variant, BA.2, that is causing COVID-19 cases to rise in Europe.

During an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" Stephanopoulos asked Fauci if there were ""any reason to reverse"" the current ""relaxation of restrictions"" across the country.

Fauci was reluctant to rule out returning to COVID-19 restrictions, despite acknowledging this latest strain was mild and responds to vaccines and prior infections.

FAUCI WARNS AMERICANS COULD FACE MORE LOCKDOWNS AMID SPREAD OF NEW COVID-19 VARIANT

""I don't think so, George, not right now. I don't see us going back into any more really very strict kinds of restrictions. But you always have to have the flexibility,"" he said.



Fauci suggested places which had relaxed restrictions could see them put back if their cases surged due to this new variant.



""Remember when the CDC came out with the modification of their metrics which would lead to the guidelines of what regions or counties in the country should have a masking indoor, they made it very clear that as you pull back on restrictions, if we do see a significant surge, particularly one that might result in increased hospitalizations, we have to be prepared to pivot and perhaps reinstitute some of those restrictions. But right now at this point George, I don't see that,"" he said.

A Johns Hopkins University meta-analysis used several studies which found lockdowns had little to no impact in reducing fatalities from COVID-19 during the Spring of 2020. The study's authors concluded that lockdowns were ""ill-founded"" and instead resulted in ""enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted.""

Near the end of the interview, Stephanopoulos asked Fauci whether he was ready to ""rest"" as we approach the end of the pandemic ""phase.""

However, Fauci said he wouldn't be leaving the public eye as we still ""have a way to go"" to getting out of the pandemic.

Chuckling, he told the Stephanopoulos, ""I'm not so sure, George. I want to make sure we're really out of this before I really seriously consider doing anything different. We're still in this, we have a way to go, I think we're clearly going in the right direction. I hope we stay that way. ""

Critics of Fauci noted how the most recognizable public health official has been noticeably absent from media interviews this past month. Former CIA analyst and radio host Buck Sexton argued this was because Fauci's ""usefulness"" to Democrats as a political ""weapon"" was running out, as even Democrat states and cities lifted mask mandates.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has publicly feuded with Fauci on multiple occasions, proposed an amendment that would eliminate the NIAID director position and divide his role into three new roles.

During the segment, Fauci seemingly dismissed concern over the crippling economic burdens associated with lockdown measures or other precautions.

A Johns Hopkins University meta-analysis of several studies in February found that lockdowns during the first COVID-19 wave in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by .2% in the U.S. and Europe .

""In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.""

In an interview with The Associated Press, the former California attorney general said that America has reached a ""pivotal point"" in the third year of the pandemic.

BIDEN NAMES NEW COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR WITH JEFF ZIENTS STEPPING DOWN

""How well we pivot is on us,"" he cautioned, noting that without the money for life-saving vaccines, tests and treatments America will be ""stuck on the ground.""

In his State of the Union address, President Biden presented a COVID-19 initiative for a new and ""more normal"" phase of the pandemic.

The administration's National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan – released earlier this month – focuses on four key goals, including protecting against and treating the disease, preparing for new variants, preventing economic and educational shutdowns and continuing to lead the effort to vaccinate the world.

The plan includes ""Test to Treat,"" which allows Americans to get tested for coronavirus at a pharmacy and receive antiviral pills ""on the spot at no cost"" if they are positive.

The president noted that vaccine-maker Pfizer Inc. is currently ""working overtime"" to get Americans a million pills in March and more than double that number in April.

Becerra said that a funding impasse with lawmakers could hamper ""Test to Treat,"" adding that HHS is trying also to prepare in order for millions not to lose health insurance if their eligibility for Medicaid lapses when the government ends the nationwide COVID-19 public health emergency.

The White House and Capitol Hill are currently deadlocked over requests for aid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., scrapped pandemic aid from the massive $1.5 trillion spending bill signed by the president on Tuesday.

PFIZER-BIONTECH SEEK AUTHORIZATION FOR SECOND COVID-19 BOOSTER

Biden had originally asked for $22.5 billion which later became a $15.6 billion package, but objections from both Democrats and Republicans have kept a deal from going through.

On Thursday, Pelosi called on the White House to request $45 billion in COVID-19 relief.

""I think they should be double what they asked for, because even when they were asking for like 20-some [billion dollars] it was only going to get us to June,"" Pelosi told reporters, according to The Hill.

The White House says that the money for some efforts will run out by the end of the month, with free COVID-19 care for the uninsured also at risk.

Becerra said that a return to ""normal living"" will only work ""if everyone does their part.""

If not, he said that Americans should prepare, highlighting that the scientists have ""communicated pretty clearly with the American people what to do"" even as others ""[decide] to slant or skew the message, or completely distort in ways that are untrue.""

2022-03-18 17:25:00+00:00,8,"Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra warned Thursday about the United States' future without COVID-19 funding.

In an interview with The Associated Press, the former California attorney general said that America has reached a ""pivotal point"" in the third year of the pandemic.

BIDEN NAMES NEW COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR WITH JEFF ZIENTS STEPPING DOWN

""How well we pivot is on us,"" he cautioned, noting that without the money for life-saving vaccines, tests and treatments America will be ""stuck on the ground.""

In his State of the Union address, President Biden presented a COVID-19 initiative for a new and ""more normal"" phase of the pandemic.

The administration's National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan – released earlier this month – focuses on four key goals, including protecting against and treating the disease, preparing for new variants, preventing economic and educational shutdowns and continuing to lead the effort to vaccinate the world.

The plan includes ""Test to Treat,"" which allows Americans to get tested for coronavirus at a pharmacy and receive antiviral pills ""on the spot at no cost"" if they are positive.

The president noted that vaccine-maker Pfizer Inc. is currently ""working overtime"" to get Americans a million pills in March and more than double that number in April.

Becerra said that a funding impasse with lawmakers could hamper ""Test to Treat,"" adding that HHS is trying also to prepare in order for millions not to lose health insurance if their eligibility for Medicaid lapses when the government ends the nationwide COVID-19 public health emergency.

The White House and Capitol Hill are currently deadlocked over requests for aid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., scrapped pandemic aid from the massive $1.5 trillion spending bill signed by the president on Tuesday.

PFIZER-BIONTECH SEEK AUTHORIZATION FOR SECOND COVID-19 BOOSTER

Biden had originally asked for $22.5 billion which later became a $15.6 billion package, but objections from both Democrats and Republicans have kept a deal from going through.

On Thursday, Pelosi called on the White House to request $45 billion in COVID-19 relief.

""I think they should be double what they asked for, because even when they were asking for like 20-some [billion dollars] it was only going to get us to June,"" Pelosi told reporters, according to The Hill.

The White House says that the money for some efforts will run out by the end of the month, with free COVID-19 care for the uninsured also at risk.

Becerra said that a return to ""normal living"" will only work ""if everyone does their part.""

If not, he said that Americans should prepare, highlighting that the scientists have ""communicated pretty clearly with the American people what to do"" even as others ""[decide] to slant or skew the message, or completely distort in ways that are untrue.""

""We have to get to a point where we believe the health status of the country and of our people is sufficiently stabilized,"" Becerra concluded. ""I think we’re getting closer and closer to that point where we see no need to have those five alarms.""

2022-03-18 16:05:00+00:00,18,"Moderna asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday to authorize a fourth shot of its COVID-19 vaccine .

The biotech company wrote in a release that it had requested the agency amend the emergency use authorization (EUA) to allow for the additional booster in adults ages 18 years and older who have received an initial booster of any of the authorized or approved vaccines.

PFIZER-BIONTECH SEEK AUTHORIZATION FOR SECOND COVID-19 BOOSTER

""The request to include adults over 18 years of age was made to provide flexibility for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and healthcare providers to determine the appropriate use of an additional booster dose of mRNA-1273, including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities,"" the vaccine-maker said. ""This submission is based in part on recently published data generated in the United States and Israel following the emergence of omicron.""

In November, the FDA amended the EUA for both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, authorizing the use of a single booster dose for all individuals 18 years of age and older after completion of primary vaccination with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) immediately followed suit, expanding recommendations for booster shots to include all adults ages 18 years and older who received a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine at least six months after their second dose.

WHO SAYS NO EVIDENCE THAT COVID BOOSTERS ARE NEEDED FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN, YOUNG ADULTS

A single booster dose of Moderna's vaccine at the 50-microgram dose level is authorized for emergency use for adults 18 years and older and a third dose of the Moderna vaccine at the 100-microgram dose level is authorized for emergency use in immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age or older who have undergone solid organ transplantation or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromisation.

Moderna noted that clinical trials are ongoing for its omicron-specific booster.

On Tuesday, rivals Pfizer and BioNTech asked U.S. regulators to authorize an additional booster dose of their COVID-19 vaccine for seniors, citing data from Israel that they said suggests older adults would benefit.

Although cases, hospitalizations and deaths have fallen markedly since the winter's omicron variant surge, U.S. officials have been laying the groundwork to deliver additional booster doses.

2022-03-18 07:00:00+00:00,24,"Moderna asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a second booster of its COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, according to a recent New York Times report.

The company requested that the booster be considered for all adults in order to enable the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with health care providers, to determine who is most appropriate for the second booster, per the Times.

Approximately 48% of all eligible adults in the United States have received booster shots, with more than two-thirds of those 65 or older receiving them, according to the CDC.

Moderna made its request in part due to the protection that its current vaccine offers against the omicron variant both in the United States and Israel, but the request is likely to increase debate over how long immunity lasts from the two most used vaccines in the United States in the context of new emerging variants.

CDC: OMICRON HOSPITALIZED YOUNG KIDS AT 5 TIMES THE RATE DURING DELTA SURGE

This past Tuesday Pfizer, along with its partner, BioNTech, requested emergency authorization for a second booster for those 65 and older, based primarily on data from Israel, where the boosters are authorized for a broader age group, per the news outlet.

""I’m a strong proponent of giving a second booster now,"" said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

""It’s also clear that protection is waning now pretty quickly a few months after your third dose,"" he added. ""So it’s short-lived. The hope is that a second booster would restore it.""

But another expert, Dr. Jesse L. Goodman, a former chief scientist for the Food and Drug Administration, noted: ""While protection is waning against mild infections, without more information we do not yet know to what extent, if any, protection is waning against severe disease.""

The companies cited data from a CDC study released last month that found the effectiveness of Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines against hospitalization decreased from 91 percent two months after a booster shot to 78 percent after four months, but the study did not break down hospitalizations by age or by the presence of chronic conditions among other factors.

2022-03-17 23:55:00+00:00,16,"It’s been two years since the historic COVID-19 lockdowns — and as people reflect on what occurred in the spring of 2020, many are experiencing anew the feelings of stress, anxiety and other emotions that they felt back then.

Itai Danovitch, M.D., chair of the Cedars Sinai Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences in Los Angeles, told Fox News Digital in an interview that it’s important for people to understand they’re not alone as these reactions resurface on the two-year anniversary.

COVID LONELINESS CRISIS — HERE'S HOW YOU CAN FIGHT THIS PANDEMIC SIDE EFFECT

""You are not alone,"" he said. ""Everybody has their own experience, but we've had a shared or common experience in terms of dealing with this really profound threat and all the uncertainty around it.""

The psychiatry specialist said it’s important for people to develop resilience in approaching these post-traumatic responses.

CDC ‘COVID-19 BY COUNTY’ TOOL HELPS YOU LOOK UP GUIDELINES BY LOCAL AREAS

Self-care practices such as getting adequate sleep, eating well, exercising regularly, spending time outdoors and connecting with nature and with people who mean the most to us are all smart moves.

Danovitch added that establishing a sense of purpose and meaning by finding ways to be of service in one's community can help people clear a cloudy mind.

Though these approaches are general suggestions, Dr. Danovitch emphasized that responses to trauma are highly personal.

""There's no singular normal,"" he said. ""Some people externalize a lot and other people internalize,"" he added, ""and there are just so many different ways and manifestations in terms of how we handle things that are traumatic … [I want] to bring a sense of patience and compassion to the incredible wide range [of] ways that people experience trauma.""

""Some people externalize a lot and other people internalize … [There is an] incredible wide range [of] ways that people experience trauma.""

To cope with various levels of emotion and trauma, Dr. Danovitch suggested people first acknowledge that it’s OK to be stressed or anxious. He also shared the reminder that the pandemic era has been a worrisome period of uncertainty — and that the best way to address worry is to address the cause.

""When there are uncertain threats around us, or risks, we get worried,"" he said.

""The best way to deal with the worry … is directly. Sometimes when we reflect on how we feel, and we acknowledge it, the intensity, the emotions around it, diminish their hold over us.""

""Once you reflect on what's making you anxious or concerned, you can start to evaluate the source of concern,"" he continued. ""And with that information … you can take appropriate action.""

10 WAYS TO MANAGE STRESS, ACCORDING TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

For high and persistent anxiety, Dr. Danovitch recommended relaxation exercises, breathing practices and meditation.

But if anxiety or depression symptoms begin to stand in the way of one's personal well-being, seeking the guidance of a medical professional is important to do.

The WHO has shared that anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic.

In addition, Danovitch said there’s been an increased rate of substance abuse.

The doctor said there's been a rise of other forms of emotional distress as well, such as loneliness and an ongoing sense of isolation.

""Refocus and engage in quality social relationships to improve your chances of living a longer, healthier life.""

""The American Psychology Association sponsored a study,"" he said. ""Close to two thirds of adults in the study said that their life had been forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. And I think that that's really remarkable.""

In an op-ed this week for Fox News Digital, Dr. Nicole Saphier addressed the loneliness crisis born of the pandemic.

The physician advised those experiencing extended feelings of isolation to take a break, engage with people in person, refocus on a sense of being present online (rather than passively consuming media there) — and spend money wisely, among other tips.

""Humans are social beings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our natural tendencies,"" she wrote.

WHO SAYS NO EVIDENCE THAT COVID BOOSTERS ARE NEEDED FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN, YOUNG ADULTS

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would need to approve the request.

The U.S. currently recommends a primary series followed months later by a booster dose for everyone age 12 and older.

""The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It’s not that good against infections,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CBS on Sunday. ""But, we are just submitting those data to the FDA and then we will see what the experts also will say outside Pfizer.""

While coronavirus cases have plummeted since the winter's omicron surge, with the agencies and state and local governments moving to ease pandemic restrictions, public health leaders warn that the world must remain vigilant and continue to use the tools that protect against the virus and potential new variants.

So far, a fourth dose is only recommended for Americans with severely weakened immune systems.

FAUCI SAYS FUTURE REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL COVID-19 BOOSTERS BEING MONITORED

In November 2021, the CDC expanded the eligibility of COVID-19 booster shots to all adults ages 18 years and older who received a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine at least six months after their second dose.

In a Tuesday news release, Pfizer also cited ""emerging evidence"" and data from Kaiser Permanente in southern California, which ""suggests that effectiveness against both symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease caused by omicron wanes 3 to 6 months after receipt of an initial booster (third) dose.""

Although authorities say vaccinations continue to offer protection against severe illness, they haven’t held up as well against milder infections – especially those due to the omicron mutant.

Calls for a booster grew once it became clear the vaccines weren’t as strong against the omicron mutant as they were against earlier versions of the virus.

However, scientists say now that most Americans will eventually be infected and that the ultimate goal of vaccination is to prevent severe illness.

""I just tested positive for COVID. I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise. Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative,"" Obama said in a tweet.

""It’s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down,"" the former president added.

OBAMA: 'I UNDERSTAND' WHY AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW WHEN COVID-19 MANDATES WILL END

Obama has been a longtime proponent of COVID-19 vaccination. In December 2020, he joined former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in announcing his willingness to get the coronavirus vaccine publicly when it became available to ensure its safety. Former President Jimmy Carter also came out in support of the vaccine.

BUSH, CLINTON, OBAMA TO PUBLICLY GET CORONAVIRUS VACCINE TO QUELL AMERICANS' SKEPTICISM

""Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it’s the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again,"" Obama wrote on Facebook in March 2021, accompanied by footage of himself and former first lady Michelle Obama getting the shot. ""So I hope you’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It could save your life.""

&nbsp;

During an interview on SiriusXM's ""The Joe Madison Show"" in December 2020, Obama pushed back when asked about African Americans potentially being skeptical about taking a COVID-19 vaccine given past medical experiments on the community.

FORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL CALLS FOR UNVACCINATED TO BE PUT ON ‘NO-FLY LIST’

""People like Anthony Fauci, who I know, and I've worked with, I trust completely,"" Obama said. ""So if Anthony Fauci tells me this vaccine is safe, and can vaccinate, you know, immunize you from getting COVID, absolutely, I'm going to take it.""

""What I don't trust is getting COVID,"" Obama said. ""I think at this point, particularly in the African American community, we are — African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans — we have the highest death rates from this thing, and are most exposed and most vulnerable, in part because we have a lot of preexisting conditions.""

Deltacron has been reported in France, the Netherlands and Denmark and Reuters reported that researchers have identified 17 confirmed instances in both Europe and the U.S.

""We have not seen any change in the epidemiology with this recombinant. We haven't seen any change in severity. But, there are many studies that are underway,"" Van Kerhove told reporters.

Van Kerkhove called for a renewed focus on reducing the spread of the COVID-19.

In January, when cases of deltacron were first reported, some labeled deltacron a ""scariant,"", with scientists expressing skepticism over its existence.

In February, health officials in the United Kingdom officially began to monitor deltacron after it was identified in a patient, according to the country's Health Security Agency.

Now, health experts say it's too soon for people to worry about it.

William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told USA Today on Thursday that Deltacron is only a variant if it produces a large number of cases.

2022-03-10 19:15:00+00:00,22,"The World Health Organization (WHO) says the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scientific brief released by the United Nations (UN) agency said one explanation for the increase is unprecedented stress caused by the social isolation resulting from the pandemic.

WHO ISSUES COVID-19 TESTING GUIDANCE

Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and loved ones, grief following bereavement, and financial worries were all cited as factors leading to anxiety and depression.

The WHO noted that exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking among health workers.

The brief includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, showing the pandemic has disproportionately impacted young people and women.

Additionally, people with pre-existing physical health conditions were more likely to develop symptoms of mental disorders.

While those with pre-existing mental disorders do not appear to be disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, they are more likely to suffer hospitalization, severe illness and death compared to those without mental disorders. People with more severe mental disorders are particularly at risk.

BIDEN LAUNCHES NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY

Notably, the WHO wrote that the increase in the prevalence of mental health problems has coincided with severe disruptions to mental health services, and those for neurological and substance use conditions were the most disrupted among all services reported by WHO member states.

Many countries also reported major disruptions in life-saving services for mental health, including suicide prevention.

""The information we have now about the impact of COVID-19 on the world’s mental health is just the tip of the iceberg,"" WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""This is a wake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations’ mental health.""

The WHO said the most recent pulse survey on continuity of essential health services indicated that 90% of countries are working to provide mental health and psychosocial support to COVID-19 patients and responders.

The agency called for a global step up in the commitment to investing in mental health resources.

Gov. David Ige announced the move on Tuesday, citing falling COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations.

HAWAII LAST STATE TO HOLD OUT ON LIFTING MASK MANDATE AS COVID CASES CONTINUE TO FALL

Hawaii is the last state to drop the pandemic safety measure.

""I do believe that we are the last community to release the mask mandate because we care about each other and we care about our community and we are all willing to sacrifice to keep each other healthy and safe,"" Ige said.

Hawaii health officials still recommend wearing face masks indoors at schools, hospitals, prisons and other ""congregate living settings.""

The end of the mask mandate coincides with when Hawaii plans to lift its COVID-19 quarantine requirement for travelers.

State and local officials around the country have lifted mask and vaccine restrictions as January's surge of the omicron variant eased.

In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) loosened indoor mask guidance – including for schools – in counties nationwide.

""Today, I want you to know that if you've already ordered free tests, you can now order another round, shipped directly to your home and for free, so we're prepared no matter what COVID-19 brings,"" he said.

The tests are available from the federal website at COVIDtests.gov.

Each household can order a total of eight tests. If an order was already made for four in January when the program launched, another order can be placed for four more.

Biden first discussed the move at his State of the Union address last week, as well as the ""Test to Treat initiative,"" which will ensure people can get tested at a pharmacy and receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost if they are positive.

""And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks and pills ready if needed,"" he said.

Nearly half of the 500 million free tests the administration made available to the public remained unclaimed in late February.

The White House said then that Americans had placed 68 million orders for packages of tests, leaving about 46% of the stock of tests still available to be ordered.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS COVID-19 MONEY ON 'EMPTY' AS IT TIES APPROVAL TO UKRAINE AID

""We totally intend to sustain this market,"" Dr. Tom Inglesby, testing adviser to the COVID-19 response team, told The Associated Press. ""We know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants.""

NPR reported that some tests didn't ship within the seven-to-12-day window that had been promised because the administration was waiting on manufacturers.

This time, Inglesby told the outlet there is a ""fairly substantial stock of new tests"" that will be ""shipping immediately.""

""From the COVID side, the bank account is empty,"" COVID-19 deputy coordinator Natalie Quillian said. ""We’re in conversations with lawmakers about how to secure the funding, but it’s urgently needed."" Some of the consequences could be felt later this month.

""This is an urgent request and this is what is at stake in our fight against COVID,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.

A request sent to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) seeks $22.5 billion in immediate COVID-19 response needs with an ask for $10 billion to provide support to Ukraine following Russia's invasion.

""I urge the Congress to address these critical and urgent needs as part of a comprehensive government funding bill ahead of the March 11th funding deadline,"" OMB acting Director Shalanda Young said in the Wednesday letter, noting that ""additional needs may arise over time"" due to the ""rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine.""

The Biden administration has warned that COVID-19 testing manufacturers will start to slow production of at-home rapid tests this month – unless the federal government signs contracts to purchase more.

The Health Resources and Services Administration will be forced to begin winding down claims for COVID-19 treatment for uninsured people this month in Congress doesn't provide more money. The U.S. government supply of monoclonal antibodies would run out in May.

""These resources are needed promptly to immediately secure supply of highly effective oral antiviral treatments; to purchase monoclonal antibodies and pre-exposure prophylaxis; to continue operating critical testing initiatives and funding testing, treatments and vaccines for the uninsured; to initiate work on a next-generation vaccine that protects against future variants; to accelerate global vaccination efforts and provide urgent humanitarian relief abroad; and for other purposes,"" Young said.

Should regulators make the Pfizer vaccine for children under age 5 a three-dose regimen, or if they determine kids aged 5-11 should get boosted, the administration would need more money.

MORE THAN 90% OF AMERICANS CAN GO WITHOUT MASKS: CDC

In Indiana, lawmakers gave final approval Thursday to administrative steps Gov. Eric Holcomb said were necessary to end the nearly two-year-old statewide COVID-19 public health emergency declaration.

Later in the day, the governor signed an executive order ending the current public health emergency, which was due to expire on Saturday.

Also on Thursday, a mask requirement for state lawmakers in Maine was lifted by legislative leaders and a task force of officials from Ford, General Motors, Stellantis and the United Auto Workers union decided to drop a mask requirement.

Face masks will be optional for U.S. union auto workers, as long as their factories are in counties that are not at high risk for the novel coronavirus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its COVID-19 community levels map on Thursday, placing some 93% of the U.S. population in areas where virus risk levels are low enough that masks are not necessary indoors.

Previously, the agency's map put more than 70% of the population in counties where the coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals.

UKRAINE NUCLEAR AUTHORITY GIVES UPDATE ON ZAPORIZHZHIA POWER PLANT: NOW IN RUSSIAN HANDS

Low rates of testing, he said, mean there is likely to be a significant undetected transmission of the virus and – coupled with low vaccination coverage – the increased risk of ""large numbers of people developing severe disease.""

2022-03-03 21:15:00+00:00,17,"Even Hamilton Beach couldn’t make enough mixers to keep up with the mixed messaging on Capitol Hill this week.

Congress initially seemed divided about COVID protocols before President Biden’s State of the Union speech. All House and Senate members were invited this year – compared to the 200 last year due to the pandemic. Initial guidelines dictated members had to sit spaced apart in the chamber. Even some members would sit in the gallery above rather than on the floor. No handshakes or backslapping. All members had to have a negative COVID test and wear a mask to take part.

Democrats hold the majority in the House and Senate. President Biden is a Democrat. Democrats faced a conundrum. They’re trying desperately to ease the nation into some degree of normalcy and demonstrate a path out of the pandemic – especially ahead of the midterms. A fully-masked State of the Union speech would not present that optic.

In a memo, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker declared that lawmakers who refused to don a mask or adhere to other protocols risked getting kicked out of the speech.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

We now live in the age of performative politics and TikTok. One could only imagine how some GOP lawmakers would have relished the opportunity to make a scene getting bounced from the speech over COVID practices. Such dramatics would go viral and resonate in some conservative districts. Republicans would embrace casting blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who they criticize regularly for ""locking down the Capitol."" The House Ethics Committee has already fined Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., more than $100,000 for failing to wear a mask in the House chamber.

The Ethics Committee just announced this week that the Sergeant at Arms Office fined Greene for three violations alone on January 20.

But the Capitol Attending Physician along with many other jurisdictions, began to dial back masking mandates on March 1, the day of the speech.

And so, no masks were required for State of the Union. Sure. A few wore masks on their own. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., ""because we all need to remember that the immunocompromised and those over 60 remain at higher risk of severe illness."" He said it was important to wear a mask ""for those who are vulnerable.""

Reps. Al Green, D-Tex., and Jim Langevin, D-R.I., were also spotted with masks.

So, the State of the Union speech seemed and looked kind of normal. It wasn’t completely full. Congressional officials only permitted about 600 persons in the chamber. They can typically pack in 1,600 for a completely bulging State of the Union in a non-pandemic period.

WHITE HOUSE ASKS CONGRESS FOR $10B IN UKRAINE AID AS PUTIN'S BRUTAL WAR RATCHETS UP

But everyone was back to handshakes and up-close chats. President Biden lingered in the chamber for 17 minutes after his remarks concluded, signing copies of the speech and talking with lawmakers.

Unartfully, Democrats got the political optic they needed.

But something else happened on State of the Union day which never unfolded before during the pandemic. A record six lawmakers tested positive for COVID.

Reps. Dwight Evans, D-Penn., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., Ted Deutch, D-Fla. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., all tested positive.

No more than two members ever tested positive on any one day during the entire pandemic. Granted, there may have been so many positive tests because members sought out tests to gain admittance to the speech. But six positives – just for members – is significant.

Congress has proven itself to be a reliable barometer as to where the country stands with COVID. A spike in cases among members usually mirrors a spike in cases around the country. A good example came in December. Lawmakers began contracting COVID just before Christmas as the omicron wave spread. The numbers shot up on Capitol Hill in January, mimicking national coronavirus stats. Then the numbers dipped precipitously in Congress – matching the decline around the country.

Either way, the outbreak of cases, pitted against an unmasked speech, doesn’t mesh.

Then there is the internal squabbling on both sides of the aisle which also sends mixed messages.

Democrats find themselves at odds over addressing energy needs amid the war in Ukraine. The price for a barrel of oil skyrocketed to $111 Wednesday. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is pushing for an increase in domestic oil production. Republicans are appropriating the Ukraine crisis to push the Biden Administration to approve pipeline construction and leases for drilling.

But there’s a schism. Manchin’s ideas run crossways with progressives and those pushing the Green New Deal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she was disappointed President Biden didn’t address climate change in the speech. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sidestepped a question from yours truly when asked if Manchin’s energy ideas were problematic for the core of the Democratic Party.

HOUSE PASSES RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF UKRAINE AMID ‘FULL-SCALE’ RUSSIAN INVASION

""The U.S. is a major oil producer. We only get one percent of imports from Russia,"" said Schumer. ""The real problem with gas prices is gouging and monopolies. Democrats are focused on those two issues. We are focused very strongly. You’re going to hear a lot more from us on those issues in the future.""

But there was dissonance on the GOP side, too.

At the outset of the Cold War, late Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, R-Mich., said that foreign policy ""stopped at the water’s edge."" In today’s toxic political environment, the water’s edge qualifies as an EPA Superfund site.

Fox News asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., if there was danger for the GOP to hypercriticize President Biden during an international crisis or if they could strike a balance. Especially for State of the Union.

""Are we going to sit down and be quiet? No,"" replied McCarthy. ""We’re not going to sit quietly by.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said there was ""broad support"" for President Biden’s approach to Ukraine. ""But what took him so long?""

NANCY PELOSI FAVOR BANNING ALL RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES

President Biden devoted 12 minutes of his 72-minute oratory to the war in Ukraine. Members festooned their suits and blouses with blue and yellow Ukrainian flag lapels for the speech. Republicans and Democrats may disagree vehemently on a great many subjects – ranging from the riot at the Capitol to executive branch nominees. But after some initial grousing, Congress came together over Ukraine.

Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., was born in Ukraine under the Soviet regime in 1978. She was near tears when speaking about the atrocities in her homeland.

""My grandma is 95. She experienced Stalin. She experienced Hitler. But she says we never experienced something like (this war) ever,"" said Spartz.

The congresswoman characterized the war as a ""genocide.""

Spartz then lobbed serious criticism at President Biden.

""We can get together as Republicans and Democrats. But (President Biden) must act decisively. Fast. Or, the blood of many millions of Ukrainians will be on his hands, too,"" said Spartz.

He also highlighted that vaccine-maker Pfizer Inc. is currently ""working overtime"" to get Americans a million pills in March and more than double that number in April.

A White House official said the plan will roll out at hundreds of pharmacies nationwide, including CVS, Walgreens and Kroger locations.

His administration is also making more free rapid COVID-19 tests available to order at covidtests.gov – even for those who already ordered some from the federal or U.S. Postal Service websites – beginning next week.

The government has sent more than 270 million free tests to nearly 70 million households since mid-January, with nearly half of the 500 million still unclaimed.

""Tonight, I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines,"" Biden said. ""It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.""

The White House is planning to release a new ""National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan"" on Wednesday that officials said would be a ""roadmap"" that will enable the country to ""move forward safety.""

According to The New York Times, the plan is expected to address developing new vaccines and therapeutics, how to keep businesses and schools open, and a host of other issues.

NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED

In his speech, Biden also noted the U.S. must be prepared for new variants.

Echoing comments made by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, the president said new vaccines could be deployed within 100 days, if necessary.

""I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But, I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does,"" he stated, also calling on Congress to provide renewed funding for tests, masks and pills.

Additionally, White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients informed governors Tuesday that Biden is approving the extension of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support.

""FEMA’s priority throughout the response to COVID-19 has been to coordinate and provide the necessary resources and personnel states, tribes and territories need to adequately respond to the pandemic,"" FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said. ""Today’s extension of the 100% cost-share through July 1, 2022, builds on our efforts to assist impacted communities across state and federal levels.""

While COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have plummeted since January's omicron variant peak, deaths remain elevated.

""We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward,"" Biden noted.

2022-03-02 20:30:00+00:00,17,"The White House announced the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan on Wednesday, which the administration says aims to move the nation forward safely and build on progress two years after the pandemic first hit.

At the White House COVID-19 response team briefing, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients touted the plan – the result of weeks of work with experts both inside and outside of government – as ""robust and comprehensive.""

""Today we have the tools we need to protect each other and treat COVID-19,"" he said. ""They're widely available for the American people. And, with Congress' help, the president's plan will make sure that's always the case.""

BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TOP 5 MOMENTS

Echoing comments made by President Biden, he said that the administration would be prepared for the rollout of vaccines for children under the age of 5 years old.

He also referenced the ""Test to Treat"" initiative the president announced at his State of the Union address Tuesday night, and the effort to make more free at-home COVID-19 tests and N95 masks available.

""Test to Treat"" allows for Americans to get tested for coronavirus at a pharmacy and receive antiviral pills ""on the spot at no cost"" if they are positive.

""Vaccines, treatments, tests, masks – these tools are how we continue to protect people. They enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines,"" he noted. Zients added that the government will launch a website to ensure Americans can find tools at convenient locations later in March.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra later highlighted that the government has, thus far, distributed 690 million doses of vaccines, 4 million treatments, more than 270 million free N95s and free COVID-19 tests to 70 million households.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), he said, would further expand research and ramp up data sharing, with the possibility for launch new centers should Congress provide funding.

Becerra said the administration would coordinate a ""whole of government effort"" to support children and families who have experienced the loss of loved one due to COVID-19, as well as focus on strengthening mental and behavioral health services.

The secretary said HHS would continue to address the specific needs of seniors, people with disabilities and those who are immunocompromised.

NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED

The 96-page National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan focuses on four key goals, including protecting against and treating the disease, preparing for new variants, preventing economic and educational shutdowns and continuing to lead the effort to vaccinate the world.

Zients said that the U.S. variant monitoring system is ready to respond and can now detect variants at a ""very low level.""

He said the plan would create stockpiles of personal protective equipment, tests and treatments and said that the plan would continue to ensure that schools, workers and workplaces have the resources they need.

That includes a new clean air in building checklist from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a request for Congress to reinstate tax credits to help small and mid-sized businesses with paid sick and family leave.

Lastly, Zients said that the president's plan includes continuing to donate more vaccines worldwide and ""doubling down on efforts to turn those vaccines into vaccinations.""

To date, more than 215 million Americans are fully vaccinated and two-thirds of eligible U.S. adults have received a booster shot.

As Zients pointed out, the plan requires Congress to invest in tools and the plan pushed against the idea of just ""living with COVID.""

""Make no mistake, President Biden will not accept just ‘living with COVID’ any more than we accept ‘living with’ cancer, Alzheimer’s, or AIDS. We will continue our work to stop the spread of the virus, blunt its impact on those who get infected, and deploy new treatments to dramatically reduce the occurrence of severe COVID-19 disease and deaths,"" it said.

The president said Tuesday that his administration would never give up on vaccinating more Americans and would leave no one behind.

Vaccines could be deployed within 100 days in response to a new variant and Biden said he would soon send a request to Congress.

""We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life …"" he said. ""… We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward – on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.""",FoxNews,"['covid19', 'president', 'white', 'treatments', 'response', 'million', 'vaccines', 'house', 'announces', 'pandemic', 'tests', 'free', 'tools', 'zients', 'plan']",0
2022-03-02 20:20:00+00:00,39,"Deaths among older Alzheimer's patients surged 26% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to New Hampshire and Massachusetts researchers.

In a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology, the group compared mortality rates for nearly 27 million Medicare enrollees in March-December 2019 with rates for slightly fewer enrollees in March through December 2020.

DAILY WALKS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S, NEW STUDY SAYS

In addition, deaths for Medicare enrollees without the disease increased by more than 12% in 2020.

""Thus, patients with ADRD experienced a 13.3% greater mortality risk than patients without ADRD from March through December 2020,"" the authors wrote.

In nursing homes, the deaths of patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia (ADRD) increased by 33%, compared with 24% among those residents without Alzheimer's.

Among the Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations, deaths accelerated even faster than the overall ADRD population and a ""similar pattern of elevated mortality risk was observed"" among enrollees without ADRD.

These results were even applicable among Alzheimer's patients in areas with low COVID-19 prevalence.

VIAGARA MAY BE PROMISING DRUG CANDIDATE IN TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, STUDY FINDS

""We found that enrollees with ADRD were at higher risk of dying in 2020 compared with 2019, either directly of COVID-19 or because of premature death owing to disruptions in health care. These results hold both for patients with ADRD overall and for patients with ADRD residing in nursing homes,"" the researchers explained.

The study examined all causes of death, using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the authors said it represents the ""largest examination"" of mortality trends among nursing home residents during the early phase of the pandemic.

Because changes in health care delivery might disproportionately impact older adults with ADRD, the authors wrote that it is ""not difficult to imagine how the combination of less effective (or absent) outpatient care and lower inpatient admission rates led to higher mortality.""

As telehealth takes on a ""larger role"" in the delivery of health care, the study said it would be important to monitor the outcomes of older adults.

In addition, increases in caregiver stress, burden and isolation ""may have indirectly affected the health of people with ADRD and people living in nursing home settings,"" they noted.

Limitations to the study include that nursing home patients may have been in alternative institutional settings who were not captured, that COVID-19 infection rates were likely understated line early 2020, changes in case mix may have occurred and that pandemic waves did not follow a uniform timeline and that they were unable to determine why some examined hospital referral regions (HRRs) fared better than others.",FoxNews,"['covid19', 'alzheimers', 'study', 'deaths', 'enrollees', '26', 'risk', 'rates', 'mortality', 'increased', 'nursing', 'pandemic', 'adrd', 'patients', 'health']",0
2022-03-01 19:50:00+00:00,28,"Researchers in Canada believe they have found the ""first evidence"" of a deer passing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to a human.

In a paper that was published last week on bioRxiv – which has yet to be peer reviewed – the authors wrote that through a ""multidisciplinary research collaboration for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Canadian wildlife,"" they had identified a new and ""highly divergent lineage"" of the virus.

OMICRON FOUND IN NYC DEER, STUDY SHOWS

""This lineage has 76 consensus mutations including 37 previously associated with non-human animal hosts, 23 of which were not previously reported in deer. There were also mutational signatures of host adaptation under neutral selection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an epidemiologically linked human case from the same geographic region and sampling period,"" the group said. ""Together, our findings represent the first evidence of a highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer and of deer-to-human transmission.""

Previously, scientists in the U.S. found that New York's white-tailed deer were infected by the omicron variant of the coronavirus, and earlier variants were found in the deer there and other states.

White-tailed deer populations were also found to have COVID-19 in central provinces of Canada.

The researchers took samples from hundreds of white-tailed deer from southwestern and eastern Ontario during the 2021 hunting season and nasal swabs and tissue from retropharyngeal lymph nodes were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

""Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 21 samples representing 6% (17/298) of hunter-harvested [white-tailed deer] included in the present study; all positive animals were adult deer from southwestern Ontario and the majority (65%) were female,"" they explained.

In a series of tweets, one of the study's authors, Finlay Maguire, explained that their samples were ""very different from any SARS-Cov-2 previously sampled.""

BA.2: WHAT EXPERTS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE OMICRON SUB-VARIANT

""Interestingly, the closest relatives to the ON deer were human and mink-derived samples from nearby Michigan back in 2020. We also identified a single human case that was very similar to our deer samples and came from the same time-frame and region as the deer samples,"" the Dalhousie University assistant professor wrote.

""It is hard to fully resolve the relationships within this group of genomes with so few samples. However, this spatiotemporal link and known close contact with deer (epidemiological link) means this represents a potential deer-to-human transmission event,"" he said.

Upon analysis, comparing the genetic makeup of COVID-19 found in deer to cases of the virus in humans in the region, the group wrote that sustained infection of SARS-CoV-2 within white-tailed deer and opportunities for transmission back to humans ""underscore the potential for [white-tailed deer] to act as an animal reservoir.""

While it is unclear how the deer first contracted the virus, Maguire told the CBC on Sunday that this particular cases ""doesn't seem to be hugely alarming.""

He said the work informs the need for better surveillance of the virus.

A statement from Canada's public health agency to the CBC said there has been ""no sign of additional human infections with this unique sequence, since [the] single human case was identified.""

Oz, during a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), said the COVID-19 pandemic and the flawed public health messaging ""steeled"" him to run for office.

""There's no question COVID steeled me to run for office because you better be pretty tough. Rhino skin to be able to deal with the criticism,"" Oz said. ""What really got me going is when I realized the duplicitousness of the process that an authoritarian overreaching government, a top-down approach, which was destined to fail, could be lied about, that you actually could see government conspiring with media and industry to tell stories that just really don't match the reality of what we're facing.""

He added: ""That's a really dangerous thing.""

Oz said that when he began to ""get into the specifics on COVID,"" he wanted to consider ideas that were ""deserving of at least some analysis,"" but instead were met with ""silence.""

Oz was referring to hydroxychloroquine, a drug typically used to treat malaria that former President Trump discussed as a possible therapeutic early in the pandemic.

""Once he mentioned it, done — you couldn’t talk about that medication,"" Oz said.

Oz said he also raised the possibility of children returning to school, but said the option upset ""unions and democratic politicians.""

""So we went to war on things as simple as protecting our own kids,"" Oz said. ""And these are the realities that got me thinking what was it that messed up with COVID? Is it possible that Washington is also getting it wrong on the border? With inflation?""

Oz took a swipe at director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, saying he took ""control"" during the pandemic.

""When things didn't work out the way he wanted, he began to work with the media to silence people who are raising their hands and saying we can do a better job,"" Oz said. ""That is really dangerous, because now, all of a sudden, everyone’s got to kowtow to one opinion.""

Oz told Fox News Digital he has ""an issue with Dr. Fauci"" and ""challenged him to a debate.""

""I actually think he should resign,"" Oz said. ""He has given us a narrative around COVID that I do not believe was the correct one.""

""He's silenced individuals who are raising their hands to help which you go to in medicine, and he's also taking a draconian approach to using the information that is available and proclaiming narratives that have not been based on science, and they were more closely aligned with what the political realities of the time were,"" Oz told Fox News.

Oz said he doesn’t ""want a politician helping us with the national health narrative.""

""I'd rather have doctors doing it, but if you're gonna have someone at the top, have someone who's actually able to, at least transparently, show you what we got, and what our cards are that we're holding.""

He added: ""We have failed over and over again, and that has eroded the trust that Americans have in institutions.""

Oz said the erosion of trust is ""really bad for medicine, because when we do have future issues come up, we want public health services that are able to help us,"" he said. ""We saw failure, after failure, after failure, and it is reflected in a disproportionately high number of Americans who died from COVID.""

He added: ""We could have done much better. Don’t believe otherwise.""

Meanwhile, as for his campaign, Oz told Fox News he has been ""fighting on the biggest stage,"" referring to his daytime national television show.

""I've taken on Big Tech, taken on big chemical companies, Big Pharma that had been collaborating,"" Oz said. ""I've been taking on the U.S. government because, when I see wrong, and I want to empower my viewers and now my voters — I’ll go to bat for them.""

Most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings and the agency announced a change to the metric it uses in recommending the face coverings – shifting from looking at COVID-19 cases counts to a more comprehensive view about a community's risk from the virus. Roughly 70% of Americans live in low- or medium-risk counties.

Under previous guidelines, masks were recommended for individuals in communities with substantial or high transmission.

While the metrics will still consider cases, the agency will also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity.

The majority of people will no longer live in areas where the CDC is recommending masking.

This action comes as states and cities around the country have lifted indoor mask mandates and proof of vaccination requirements.

COVID-19 cases have fallen greatly since January's surge of the omicron variant, which still makes up 99.9% of new cases, according to the CDC.

Data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center shows the country saw 65,491 and 2,941 new deaths in the past day.

2022-02-25 02:15:00+00:00,112,"Young people between the ages of 12-20 have reported several cases of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome, otherwise known as MIS-C, where the immune system goes on overdrive after being vaccinated for COVID-19, according to a recent Lancet report .

The report noted MIS-C is a rare condition that can happen two to six weeks after COVID-19 infection with patients complaining of fever and showing signs and symptoms of multi-organ involvement with systemic inflammation.

""Patients with MIS-C usually present with persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions and, in severe cases, with hypotension and shock,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on their website .

The agency added the illness ""may begin weeks after a child is infected with SARS-CoV-2. The child may have been infected from an asymptomatic contact and, in some cases, the child and their caregivers may not even know they had been infected .""

First recognized in April 2020, 5973 cases were reported to the CDC between May 2020 to November 2021, with the study’s authors hypothesizing the illness develops because of a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19 infection in susceptible patients who have a genetic predisposition for the syndrome.

EXPLAINING WAR TO KIDS AS RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: WHAT TO SAY AND HOW TO SAY IT

But the study investigated if the syndrome also occurred after COVID-19 vaccination.

The study analyzed the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for potential cases of MIS-C after COVID-19 vaccination from Dec. 14, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2021, in individuals aged 12─20 years, identifying 21 young people, with a mean age of 16 years old, who met the CDC’s definition of the inflammatory condition.

The researchers noted all of these patients were hospitalized, 57% were admitted directly to the intensive care unit, with 71% with laboratory evidence of past or recent COVID-19 infection, but all were discharged home.

Even though six young people in the study didn’t have evidence of a prior COVID-19 infection, the researchers hypothesized because the lab assays have limited sensitivity for asymptomatic infections, the young participants might have been infected with COVID-19 even though they tested negative, so ""vaccination might be coincidental to the subsequent MIS-C illness .""

Over 21 million individuals ages 12-20 years old received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine as of August 31, 2021, so the overall reporting rate for MIS-C after vaccination is 1 case per million people compared to a rate of 0.3 cases per million vaccinated individuals among those without prior laboratory evidence of COVID-19, per the study.

These rates are ""substantially lower than the previously published incidence of MIS-C among unvaccinated individuals in this age group in the USA who had SARS-CoV-2 infection (approximately 200 cases per million SARS-CoV-2 infections),"" the researchers said .

CDC: PEDIATRIC ER VISITS SKYROCKET FOR INJURIES AND EATING DISORDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC

Although the report seems concerning, most of the cases in the study were not considered fully vaccinated, so unvaccinated young people are still more likely to develop MIS-C than those who are fully vaccinated, according to a Today report .

""At first glance, it seems to cause us to step back and say, ‘Wait a minute, are these vaccines contributing to MIS-C?’"" said Dr. Jim Versalovic, pathologist-in-chief and COVID-19 command center co-leader at Texas Children’s Hospital .

""It does the opposite for me. It emphasizes the point of vaccination.""

The study found 11 young people developed MIS-C after their first vaccination dose with eight days as median time from first being vaccinated to hospitalization compared to 10 individuals who developed the systemic illness after receiving their second dose and five days as the median time from first being vaccinated to getting hospitalized.

The study has limitations including underestimating rates of all MIS-C cases among those who received the COVID-19 vaccine because the data was analyzed by passive reporting systems and because the researchers relied only on reports with final diagnoses that noted MIS-C since there is no definitive test to diagnose the condition.

Experts urge parents to get their teenagers vaccinated as only 57% of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC .

The researchers concluded the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine to MIS-C is unknown, so they encouraged health care providers to rule out other causes when evaluating individuals with a clinical presentation consistent with the systemic syndrome.

""Continued surveillance for MIS-C illness after COVID-19 vaccination is warranted, especially as pediatric COVID-19 vaccination is authorized and recommended for younger children who comprise the highest proportion of MIS-C cases after SARS-Cov-2 infection,"" the researchers said.

2022-02-25 00:10:00+00:00,13,"As the Omicron wave of COVID-19 fades, voters are feeling hopeful again about the novel virus being contained.

Thirty-six percent say coronavirus is ""completely"" or ""mostly"" under control, the second-highest number recorded since the pandemic started, trailing the 46% who felt that way last May. Still, 43 percent feel it is only somewhat under control while 19% say it is ""not at all.""

Those numbers are better than last month, when 22% felt the virus was completely/mostly under control, 37% said it was ""somewhat"" under control, and 41% ""not at all"" (January 16-19, 2022).

That’s according to the latest Fox News national survey, released Thursday.

With more optimism that things are improving comes more interest in unmasking -- though voters’ opinions on the need for mask mandates varies substantially in different settings.

BA.2: WHAT EXPERTS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE OMICRON SUB-VARIANT

By a 9-point margin, registered voters think it is time to remove mask mandates for employees/customers in restaurants and businesses (53% remove vs. 44% keep). By a narrower 4-point margin, more think it is time to stop requiring that students wear masks in schools (50% remove vs. 46% keep). Travel is an entirely different matter, as voters want mask mandates to remain for travelers on planes and trains by 19 points (39% remove vs. 58% keep).

The partisan divide is intact, as majorities of Republicans think mask mandates should end in each scenario, while majorities of Democrats say masks should stay on.

When it comes to mask mandates in schools, there is discord in the home: moms want students to keep masks on by 8 points, while dads think it is time to take them off by 13 points.

""Americans are clearly getting tired of the pandemic and mask mandates, but support for public health mandates remains reasonably high and varies considerably depending upon context,"" says Republican Daron Shaw who conducts the Fox News poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""Democratic support for these measures is still high, and presumably is what’s keeping President Biden's overall support in the 40s.""

While Biden’s approval rating on coronavirus remains his best, he is still underwater by four points (47% approve vs. 51% disapprove). That’s a far cry from last summer when he was in positive territory by 30 points (64%-34%, June and May 2021).

His ratings are worse on climate change (-6 points), foreign policy (-20), uniting the country (-20), the economy (-24), crime (-24), and immigration (-28).

Biden’s overall job rating is at a new low: 43% approve vs. 56% disapprove.

White House chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci’s approval rating on the virus has also declined. He now stands at 52% approve vs. 46% disapprove. In May 2021 (the last time the question was asked), 60% approved -- still, that is down significantly from his prior high of 80% at the start of the pandemic (April 2020).

Fauci saw one of his biggest declines among Republicans: 33% approved of him last May compared to just 20% today. Democrats held steady in their approval (88% in May vs. 87% today).

REPUBLICANS PRESS FOR DC TO REMOVE MASK MANDATES FOR CHILDREN

Vaccinating: Freedom vs. safety

The new survey also asks how voters balance two competing priorities: freedom and public safety.

The result? Almost even.

Just over half of voters, 51%, say it is more important to protect the freedom to choose whether or not to get vaccinated. Slightly fewer, 46%, think it is more important to protect public safety by requiring vaccination to participate in everyday activities.

In August, the narrow preference went in the opposite direction by 3 points: 50% prioritized protecting Americans’ safety vs. 47% protecting their freedom to choose.

Most Democrats (76%) say protecting safety is more important, while for majorities of Republicans (78%) and independents (55%) the priority is protecting freedom.

2022-02-24 17:30:00+00:00,117,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday said younger males should consider waiting longer between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in order to reduce the risk of a rare form of heart inflammation.

In an update on its website, the agency suggested an eight-week interval between the first and second doses of a primary mRNA vaccine schedule.

WHAT IS MYOCARDITIS? SIGNS, SYMPTOMS TO LOOK FOR

The ""mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at the FDA-approved or FDA-authorized intervals, but a longer interval may be considered for some populations. While absolute risk remains small, the relative risk for myocarditis is higher for males ages 12-39 years, and this risk might be reduced by extending the interval between the first and second dose,"" the agency said.

The CDC cited studies in adolescents and adults showing the small risk of myocarditis associated with vaccines might be reduced and peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness may be increased with an interval longer than four weeks.

""Extending the interval beyond 8 weeks has not been shown to provide additional benefit. There are currently no data available for children ages 11 years and younger. Therefore, an 8-week interval may be optimal for some people ages 12 years and older, especially for males ages 12–39 years,"" the CDC said.

Notably, the change will not impact many people, as the CDC reports 73% of people age 12 and older already have gotten two doses of vaccine.

In addition, while the suggestion to wait up to two months doesn't apply, the initial, shorter interval is still recommended for those with weakened immune systems, people age 65 and older and anyone who needs fast protection due to risk of severe disease.

The government authorized the Pfizer shots as a two-dose series spaced three weeks apart, and the Moderna shots to be spaced four weeks apart.

CORONAVIRUS VACCINES: WHY ARE SOME COUNTRIES RECOMMENDING SINGLE DOSE FOR TEENS, YOUNG ADULTS?

Mostly adolescent and young adult males developed myocarditis after the second shot and the CDC says that – among males ages 18 to 39 – the condition has been reported in about 68 per 1 million getting the second Moderna dose and about 47 per 1 million getting the second Pfizer dose.

The CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized Pfizer vaccines in children ages 5-11 and adolescents ages 12-17 based on the determination that benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risk of serious side effects.

""After reviewing available data on the risks and benefits, ACIP and CDC determined that the benefits (e.g., prevention of COVID-19 cases and its severe outcomes ) outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for children, adolescents and young adults.,"" it said.

The CDC also highlighted that most myocarditis and pericarditis patients have been hospitalized for short periods and that most have achieved resolution of acute symptoms.

Symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis include chest pain, shortness of breath or tachycardia, and people should seek care if such symptoms develop, particularly in the week after vaccination.

The CDC said accumulating evidence suggests a higher risk for myocarditis following Moderna vaccination compared with Pfizer vaccination, with data showing the risk for myocarditis or pericarditis lower in young adults after mRNA booster doses.

A booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for everyone ages 12 years and older.

A three-dose primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series is recommended for people ages 5 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.

2022-02-23 18:38:51+00:00,137,"The United Kingdom's government is increasingly reassured that the coronavirus pandemic was the result of a lab leak in Wuhan, China, according to a new report.

While the theory that the coronavirus was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology was dismissed by world governments early into the pandemic, evidence continues to trickle out supporting the claim. Government officials in the U.K., U.S., and elsewhere have begun voicing support for further investigation into the lab leak possibility.

Now, sources tell British newspaper the Telegraph that the ""official view"" within the U.K.'s leadership is that the virus did indeed escape from the Chinese lab, though government officials are more open about that view in private than in public.

""I think the official view [within Government] is that it is as likely as anything else to have caused the pandemic. A lot of people like myself think it is more likely. I think attitudes have changed a little bit. The zoonotic transfer theory just didn’t make sense,"" Cambridge bio-security fellow Hamish de-Bretton Gordon told the paper.

FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN

""There is a huge amount of concern about coming out publicly, but behind closed doors most people think it’s a lab leak. And they are coming round to the fact that even if they don’t agree with that, they must accept it’s likely, and they must make sure the policies are in place to stop it,"" de-Bretton explained.

Medical professionals in the U.S. have begun walking back their initial dismissal of the lab leak theory, though many continue to emphasize that investigations into the source of the pandemic are a ""distraction.""

Former National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told Fox News on his last day in office that he's ""sorry"" the Wuhan lab-leak theory has become such a ""huge distraction"" for the country, despite there being ""no evidence"" to support it.

Collins joined ""Fox News Sunday"" on his last day in office after more than a decade in the agency's top position. The geneticist and physician tapped by President Barack Obama to lead the NIH in 2009 dodged questions about his efforts to discredit the lab-leak theory at the onset of the pandemic, maintaining the most plausible explanation is that the virus spread through animal-to-human transmission.

""I’m really sorry that the lab leak has become such a distraction for so many people because frankly, we still don’t know,"" Collins told host Bret Baier.

U.S. scientists who publicly attributed the COVID-19 pandemic to natural origins rather than human engineering were far less confident in private, transcripts and notes from previous meetings show.

However, conversations between public officials seem to indicate that some experts may have consciously chosen to suppress evidence that could fuel ""conspiracists.""

""I really can't think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from the bat virus ... to nCoV where you insert exactly four amino acids 12 nucleotide that all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function,"" Dr. Robert Garry from Tulane's School of Medicine said, according to notes from a February 2020 meeting released by House Republicans.

On Thursday, the Maryland State Board of Education voted to allow local school districts to decide whether students must don face masks in school and sent the proposal to end an emergency order to a legislative committee.

The board voted 12-2 to rescind the order on March 1, citing positive COVID-19 trends.

LA COUNTY TO LOOSEN MASK RULES WHEN COVID-19 NUMBERS IMPROVE: REPORT

The Maryland General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review has scheduled a virtual hearing and vote on the request for Friday.

""This action aligns with the data and the science, the recommendation of the State Superintendent of Schools, and the guidance of medical professionals across the country,"" Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement on the matter.

Under current policy, local school systems there can decide to end the mask requirement if the spread of COVID-19 is moderate or low for 14 days in a row or if vaccination rates are higher than 80% in the school or community.

Maryland ended the state’s indoor mask mandate in May.

Several other states have announced plans to lift statewide mask requirements in schools, including Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and Oregon.

In California – the first state to formally shift to an ""endemic"" approach to the coronavirus – officials previously delayed a decision on school mask regulations.

In an online announcement, California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said his department would reassess whether the current rule should change on Feb. 28.

""This is not a decision we take lightly, it is not a decision that is a hasty one,"" he said, noting that California’s vaccination rates for children are still low and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends masks in schools.

CHICAGO TO FOLLOW ILLINOIS IN LIFTING MASK ORDER BY MONTH'S END

California's indoor mask mandate has been lifted for most indoor settings for those who are vaccinated.

Those who remain unvaccinated will still be required to be masked indoors and everyone – regardless of vaccination status – will have to wear masks in higher-risk settings.

Local governments can continue their own indoor mask requirements, as Los Angeles County health officials announced they would. Supervisor Janice Hahn tweeted Tuesday that the Department of Public would issue a new health order allowing for vaccinated people to remove masks indoors at places that check for proof of vaccination.

The order would potentially ""take effect Friday,"" and she said it puts the county ""significantly closer to aligning with the state.""

Previously, county officials said face coverings would no longer be required in certain outdoor settings once hospitalizations in the area drop and that masks would still be necessary indoors until the county recorded two consecutive weeks at or below ""moderate"" transmission of the virus .

The county said it would not further rescind masking requirements unless there were no reports of significantly circulating variants of concern that have the ability to threaten vaccine effectiveness.

While the omicron variant is still circulating around the country – making up 99.9% of new COVID-19 cases – the number of daily cases and deaths has fallen.

In a study published in JAMA Network, a team of French authors conducted a prospective cohort study in 23 ICUs in France from January to June 2020 – and a final follow-up in October 2020.

BIDEN ADMIN AWARDS $103M FROM AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO FIGHT HEALTH CARE WORKER BURNOUT

ARDS survivors and family members – one family member per patient – were enrolled, with 517 family members in total.

Family member symptoms of PTSD at 90 days after ICU discharge were measured by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised score and symptoms of anxiety and depression at 90 days were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

The researchers used multivariable logistic regression models to determine the association between the COVID-19 status and outcomes.

They found PTSD in 35% of family members related to patients with COVID-19 ARDS, compared with 19% for any other cases of respiratory issues.

EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT POTENTIAL 'GAME-CHANGER’ FOR TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION, STUDY SAYS

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were also higher among family members of patients with COVID-19 ARDS.

Study limitations, according to the authors, include that the patients were admitted early on in the pandemic, that the results may not apply to ICUs that do not place a strong focus on family care, that participating hospitals are in France, that not all patients may have met the strict consensus criteria for ARDS, and that ICU clinical staff did not participate in the study.

""There are many potential explanations for these findings, including the need to comply with strict isolation measures to prevent viral transmission and the strain put on ICU staff due to the surge in patient numbers caused by the pandemic. When ICUs are perceived as closed departments, visitors may feel unwelcome, and these closed ICUs can generate stress and symptoms of anxiety, depression or PTSD in the family members."" they explained, noting their findings are consistent with previous research.

Lastly, they pointed out that perceived social support during the ICU stay was an important factor associated with family outcomes, citing a survey of nearly 900 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in China that found poorer perceived social support was associated with anxiety, depression and PTSD.

2022-02-20 23:15:00+00:00,22,"After the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delayed authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine last week for children under the age of five in the United States, parents are making a passionate plea for its off-label use, according to a recent Guardian report.

Last summer, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advised against off-label use for children under the age of 12, said 2021 AAP President Dr. Lee Savio Beers in a statement.

""The dose may be different for younger ages. The AAP recommends against giving the vaccine to children under 12 [years] until authorized by the FDA.""

The Moderna vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 and older while the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved for those ages 16 and older, but vaccines for younger patients are still under emergency use authorization, per the report.

NEW YORK SCRAPS HEALTH CARE WORKERS BOOSTER MANDATE TO AVOID ‘STAFFING ISSUES’

And when health care providers sign an agreement to administer the vaccines, they agree not to provide the vaccine for non-authorized indications, such as off-label use, the report said.

""If providers were to give it to these children, they could lose their status as a vaccine provider,"" Dr. Sean O’Leary, pediatric infectious diseases specialist and vice-chair of the AAP’s committee on infectious diseases, recently told the Guardian.

The 10-microgram vaccine authorized for kids five to 11 has not been studied in younger children, who receive a 3-microgram dose in the Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric trial, so it’s possible children younger than five can have more side effects if they receive the higher dose, according to the Guardian.

But the paper noted some parents and physicians argue the clinical trials have already demonstrated the 3-microgram dose is safe in young children.

""I don’t see a difference in a child four years and five years, except for the age – the immune system works the same,"" said Dr, Wolfgang von Meissner, a family doctor in Germany.

But after Pfizer-BioNTech discovered the omicron variant led to a higher rate of infection than previously documented in younger patients in their clinical trial, they requested a delay to authorize it because of the variant’s ability to evade the immunity provided by the two-dose series of the vaccine, according to the New York Times.

A FOURTH COVID SHOT: WILL IT BE NECESSARY?

The paper noted that December data from the clinical trial showed children between the ages of two and four only produced 60% of an antibody response when compared to the antibody response of older teenagers and young adults, a group which is used as benchmark to document effectiveness of the vaccine.

In contrast, children ages 6 months to two years old developed an antibody protection that met the study’s goal without safety concerns, but the dose used for these children was one-tenth of the dose given to children 12 years and older, the Times added.

In Germany, however, Von Meissner has administered 2,500 vaccines to children between the ages of six months to five years old, because even though the vaccine is not approved for children under the age of five in the country, there is no restriction for its off-label use as in the United States, according to the Guardian.

""I don’t see why I shouldn’t protect little kids,"" he said. But he cautioned it’s important to inform parents of the risks of a non-approved vaccine for an off-label use before administering it.

""They need to understand, and then they need to make the decision,"" he added.

Von Meissner said expanding the vaccine to an off-label use in the U. S. would give additional protection to families, some of whom become so desperate as to lie about their children’s ages so that their children can qualify for them, but this is strongly advised against by experts, per the report.

The paper noted another alternative for more children to get vaccinated could be if the Pfizer-BioNTech trial included more kids under the age of five in their clinical trials, which would also provide more data.

For example, since the 3-microgram dose was only effective in children between the ages of six months to two years, but not in children two to five years old, the trial could divide all the participants under the age of five into different age subgroups and test different doses in each subset, per the report.

The paper suggested another way to increase availability is to make the shots available for very high-risk children through the FDA’s expanded access program.

""The public health data shows that we’re ready to take this step in our recovery,"" Wu said in a press release. ""This news highlights how much progress we’ve made in our fight against COVID-19 thanks to vaccines and boosters – which have always been our most effective weapon against the pandemic.""

Many others leaders are following suit and in Washington state the vaccine verification or proof of a negative COVID-19 test will no longer be required for attendance at large events.

In addition, the state's mask mandate will lift in most places – including at schools and childcare facilities – beginning on March 21.

On Thursday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also lifted her state's mask mandate for indoor public spaces.

However, while some have acted to ease regulations – including in California, Connecticut, Oregon, Illinois and other states – others extended mandates.

In Newark, New Jersey, Fox 5 reported Thursday that the mayor had issued an order relaxing the city's proof of vaccination requirement for businesses, but would still require proof of either vaccination or a negative test.

In addition, Mayor Ras Baraka extended the mask-wearing requirement for all indoor public facilities through at least Feb. 28.

To the south, Navajo Nation – which extends into New Mexico, Utah and Arizona – is maintaining a mask mandate and President Jonathan Nez said the tribe must do everything it can to help those who are treating the afflicted.

""Please be very cautious, encourage your elders to take precautions and continue to pray,"" he said in a statement Friday.

In New York, where the omicron variant began infecting huge numbers in December, a statewide indoor mask mandate for businesses has ended.

On Friday, state health officials said it would not enforce its mandate requiring health care workers to get COVID-19 boosters in light of concerns about staffing shortages.

""While we are making progress with 75% of staff received or are willing to receive their booster, the reality is that not enough healthcare workers will be boosted by next week’s requirement in order to avoid substantial staffing issues in our already overstressed healthcare system,"" state health commissioner Mary Bassett said in a statement.

New York already requires health care workers to get vaccinated, with exemptions for workers who have a medical reason for not being eligible to receive the shot.

Leaders across the U.S. have cited falling case rates and hospitalizations since January's surge of the omicron variant as reasons to lift proof of vaccine or mask mandates.

Washington's King County announced that it will no longer require COVID-19 vaccination checks to enter restaurants, bars, theaters and gyms beginning March 1.

Philadelphia officials said the city’s vaccine mandate for restaurants was immediately lifted – though indoor mask mandates remain in place for now.

In Provincetown, Massachusetts, officials lifted a mask mandate and vaccine requirement for indoor spaces like restaurants and bars on Tuesday.

Around the U.S. the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases has dropped from approximately 453,000 two weeks ago to about 136,000 as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The study found that infants younger than six months old were 61% less likely to be hospitalized if their mothers received a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine, according to the report.

The CDC recommended that women who are trying to conceive, are pregnant or are breastfeeding get vaccinated after finding that mothers who are vaccinated are likely to pass on the immunity protection against the virus, the report said.

ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER IMMUNE SYSTEMS, STUDY SAYS

""The CDC study has reaffirmed the additional benefit of COVID vaccination for pregnant moms: protection for the newborn child up to 6 months of age,"" said Dr. Michael Nimaroff, senior vice president and executive director of Ob/Gyn services for Northwell Health in New York. He was not part of the study.

According to the CDC report, the researchers studied 379 newborns under the age of six months at 20 different children's hospitals across 17 states from July 2021 to January 2022. According to the CDC, 84% of the 176 babies hospitalized with COVID-19 were born to mothers who did not receive the vaccine.

The study also noted that 88% of babies with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units were born to unvaccinated mothers. The mother of one infant who died during the study was not vaccinated, the authors of the report noted.

The Food and Drug Administration has not authorized COVID-19 vaccinations for children under five years of age.

This presents a potential problem for infants younger than six months old who the public health agency said are at risk of life-threatening complications from a COVID-19 infection, such as acute respiratory failure, the study noted.

SEVERE, CRITICAL COVID-19 CASES MORE LIKELY IN VITAMIN D-DEFICIENT PEOPLE: STUDY

""COVID vaccination in pregnancy has been recommended for some time both due to its safety in pregnancy as well as the increased risks of symptomatic COVID infection to both the mom and her developing child,"" Nimaroff, also chairman of the department of Ob/Gyn at North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center on Long Island, New York, told Fox News.

Last year, the CDC officially recommended COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women. Health experts told Fox News studies show that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of severe complications and death.

""While it is very understandable that women who are pregnant are concerned about putting anything extraneous in their bodies, women must understand that getting COVID in pregnancy is far worse,"" said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease expert and chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau on Long Island.

""There are no data that suggest that COVID-19 vaccination is dangerous in pregnancy, but there are several studies documenting that getting COVID-19 in pregnancy can be fatal,"" added Glatt, who also serves as the chief of infectious diseases and spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The CDC did note in the report that ""protection was higher among infants whose mothers were vaccinated later in pregnancy"" and that further studies are needed comparing the timing of vaccination before pregnancy and during pregnancy.

""The potential future requirement for an additional boost or a fourth shot for mRNA or a third shot for J&J is being very carefully monitored in real time. And recommendations, if needed, will be updated according to the data as it evolves,"" Fauci said during a press briefing by the White House COVID-19 response team.

Fauci showed hospitalization data he said indicated booster shots are ""safe and well-tolerated."" He cited multiple studies of vaccine effectiveness which showed that, for those with a normal immune response, ""a single booster shot continues to provide high levels of protection against severe disease caused by omicron,"" he added.

""This should not be confused with the fact that for many immunocompromised people, already a second booster shot, namely a fourth dose of an mRNA, is recommended because of what we know about their poor response to the initial regimen,"" Fauci said.

His comments came just days after he suggested that annual booster shots may not be needed for every American, the Financial Times reported.

""It will depend on who you are,"" Fauci said. ""But if you are a normal, healthy 30-year-old person with no underlying conditions, you might need a booster only every four or five years.""

During that interview, published last Tuesday, he added that the U.S. was nearing the end of the ""full-blown"" phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and that certain protocols, including mandatory masks in some settings, could end ""soon,"" according to the paper.

""As we get out of the full-blown pandemic phase, which we are certainly heading out of, these decisions will increasingly be made on a local level rather than centrally decided or mandated,"" Fauci said. ""There will also be more people making their own decisions on how they want to deal with the virus.""

He noted the timeline for lifting restrictions could happen at some point in 2022.

In the U.S., the seven-day average of cases dropped 40% from the previous week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Daily hospital admission average dropped 28% and the seven-day average of daily deaths dropped 9%, the CDC data added, according to the White House.

During the briefing, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said the U.S. was ""moving toward a time when COVID isn’t a crisis but is something we can protect against and treat.""

""We’ve made tremendous progress in our ability to protect ourselves against COVID-19. 75% — three out of every four adults — are fully vaccinated, and two-thirds of eligible adults have gotten their booster shot,"" Zients added. ""The president and our COVID team are actively planning for this future. As we look forward, we’ll continue to enhance the powerful set of tools that we have at our disposal. Vaccines, booster shots, tests, and treatments will keep protecting our most vulnerable, including the immunocompromised.""

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, at the same briefing, added that hospital capacity will be a key metric in determining whether the CDC weighs adding new COVID-19 guidance, including the wearing of face masks.

Walensky noted the revised guidelines could come at the end of February or early March.

The group cited widespread vaccinations and waning case numbers across the state and on system campuses.

School mask mandates will end on March 1, according to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, if the General Assembly adopts amendments made to just-passed legislation on the issue.

The bill – passed by the legislature on Monday – gives parents and students the ability to opt out of mandates imposed by local school boards.

However, the legislation would not have taken effect until July 1.

Youngkin added an emergency clause to the legislation allowing it to take effect immediately upon passage and added a provision giving school districts until March 1 to develop plans to comply with the law.

The amended legislation now must pass both legislative chambers again.

2022-02-15 20:55:00+00:00,49,"People who have a vitamin D deficiency are more likely to have a severe or fatal case of COVID-19, researchers said.

In a retrospective study published in the journal PLOS ONE, scientists from Galilee Medical Center and Bar Ilan University in Israel examined the records of more than 1,176 patients admitted between April 7, 2020, and Feb. 4, 2021, to the Nahariya-based Galilee Medical Center with positive PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests for SAR-CoV-2. Those records were searched for vitamin D levels measured two weeks to two years prior to infection.

VITAMIN D DEFIENCY LINKED TO MORTALITY RISK IN SOME PEOPLE, RESEARCHERS SAY

The individuals were categorized according to vitamin D levels – marked as deficient, insufficient, adequate and high-normal – and COVID-19 disease severity, which was determined utilizing a multivariable regression analysis.

More than 250 patients had records of vitamin D levels prior to COVID-19 infection, and the team found that patients with vitamin D deficiency were 14 times more likely to have a severe or critical case of COVID-19.

Mortality among patients with sufficient vitamin D levels was 2.3%, compared with 25.6% in the deficient group.

""A lower vitamin D status was more common in patients with the severe or critical disease than in individuals with mild or moderate disease,"" the study concluded.

When adjusted for age, gender, season and history of chronic diseases, the differences still applied.

According to Bar Ilan University, the study is among the first to analyze vitamin D levels prior to infection and the infections build upon results initially published on MedRxiv.

WAYS TO GET MORE VITAMIN D IN YOUR DIET

""Our results suggest that it is advisable to maintain normal levels of vitamin D. This will be beneficial to those who contract the virus,"" study leader Dr. Amiel Dror, of the Galilee Medical Center and Azrieli Faculty of Medicine of Bar-Ilan University, said in a statement. ""There is a clear consensus for vitamin D supplementation on a regular basis as advised by local health authorities as well as global health organizations.""

""This study contributes to a continually evolving body of evidence suggesting that a patient's history of vitamin D deficiency is a predictive risk factor associated with poorer COVID-19 clinical disease course and mortality,"" study co-author Prof. Michael Edelstein, of the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine of Bar-Ilan University, said. ""It is still unclear why certain individuals suffer severe consequences of COVID-19 infection while others don’t. Our finding adds a new dimension to solving this puzzle.""

Notably, the study is based on research conducted before coronavirus vaccines were widely available, and the doctors stressed to The Times of Israel that vitamin supplements are not a substitute for vaccines, but a way to aid immunity levels.

Dror told the publication that while the study was also conducted before the omicron variant's surge, the coronavirus doesn't change fundamentally enough between variants to negate vitamin D effectiveness.

The Times also noted that health officials in several countries have recommended vitamin D supplements during the pandemic.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, vitamin D helps to keep bones strong, absorb calcium and work with the parathyroid glands.

Washington's indoor mask requirements are set to be ""dialed back"" on March 1 and, beginning Tuesday, indoor venues will no longer be required to verify that patrons are vaccinated.

Businesses, however, may choose to keep vaccination requirements in place.

The Washington Post said Monday that reaction to the changes has been mixed and officials are still advising that residents wear masks indoors.

According to the outlet, masks will still be required in some places like schools, public transit and emergency shelters. Health care employees will still be subject to a profession-specific vaccine requirement.

There were 475 new confirmed positive cases reported Monday and no additional deaths.

In Philadelphia, sources told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the city's vaccine mandate for indoor dining could end this week if benchmarks – including cases, hospitalizations, test positivity rates and the rate of case increase – are met.

Fox 29 reported that the city's health department said the commissioner planned to address metrics guiding their decision-making on Wednesday.

Philadelphia officials said the city has averaged 194 new cases of COVID-19 per day over the last two weeks and that 360 patients infected with the virus are currently being treated in area hospitals.

The Boulder County Board of Health voted to end the county's mask mandate starting Friday, though the state requires unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated people to wear masks in homeless shelters, prisons, jails, community corrections programs and facilities and emergency medical and other health care settings.

Colorado also ""follows CDC"" in recommending that local public health agencies, school districts and early childhood education programs consider universal mask requirements for all individuals regardless of vaccination status.

While some, like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, have called for the end of mask mandates in schools, California Gov. Gavin Newsom delayed the decision Monday.

""The message today, which I hope is clear, is today a change isn’t being made,"" California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said in an online announcement. Ghaly said the department will reassess on Feb. 28 whether the rule should change.

""This is not a decision we take lightly, it is not a decision that is a hasty one,"" he added, highlighting that the state's vaccination rates for children remain low and the CDC still recommends masks in schools.

The news came a day before California lifts its mask mandate for most indoor settings for vaccinated people.

Unvaccinated people will still be required to be masked indoors, and everyone – regardless of vaccination status – will have to wear masks in higher-risk settings like public transit and nursing homes.

Local governments can continue their own indoor mask requirements.

The California Department of Public Health said that, as of Monday, the average daily case count over seven days is 23,715, with 8,189 hospitalizations and 163 daily deaths over seven days.

Half a dozen other states have announced plans to end statewide school mask mandates by the end of February or March.

Sey, a mother of four, explained in the post that she had long been an advocate for children and that Levi's had always supported her in the past when she expressed other political views, but that all changed after Sey refused to stop speaking out against California shutting down public schools in the name of safety due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""I've been a Democrat my entire voting life,"" Sey told FOX Business in an interview following her post. ""I feel the party has abandoned their principles and I find myself quite politically homeless.""

After that, Sey says, she was accused of being racist despite being a longtime supporter of racial equity and the mother of two Black children. Levi's head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion asked her to go on an ""apology tour,"" but she refused.

Sey wrote that last fall, Bergh told her that she ""was on track to become the next CEO of Levi's"" and that ""the only thing standing in my way, he said, was me. All I had to do was stop talking about the school thing.""

""It's wrong to stifle speech and dissent,"" Sey told FOX Business. ""This isn't a Levi's issue, it's a broader cultural issue. We seem to have lost the ability to converse, to disagree, to debate and still respect each other.""

When asked how she believes Levi's should have handled the situation, Sey said, ""I think it was possible to support my speaking out without necessarily sharing all of my views. And in doing so, create a culture that is truly inclusive, and where everyone feels they can use their voice and contribute without holding pieces of themselves back.""

The Levi's veteran says she has heard from people both inside and outside of Levi's in reaction to her post, including ""those who have left and those in other companies who feel afraid to speak up about issues they care about"" who ""feel there is one right answer and that anything that goes against the current orthodoxy – on COVID or other issues – would be considered an HR violation.""

A growing number of medical professionals, parents and bipartisan state officials throughout the nation are calling for an end to school mask requirements,"" the governor said Thursday. ""In light of dramatic improvements to our health metrics and the widespread availability of vaccines, I am calling on you to take action to rescind this policy.""

MASK MANDATES EASED ACROSS US AS COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS DROP BELOW 100,000

Hogan announced that hospitalizations in Maryland have dropped by 71% – falling to below 1,000.

While the education board released a statement earlier this week saying that it was watching COVID-19 metrics improve in the state ""with optimism,"" Hogan highlighted the ""consequences"" of pandemic regulations and the need to ""move toward normalcy for students and families by rescinding the school masking policy.""

The governor also pointed out that Maryland ended the state's indoor mask mandate in May.

""We must all learn to live with this virus, not in fear of it,"" he said.

Nevada's Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak announced that the state no longer required face coverings in most places, ""effective immediately.""

On Thursday, the Nevada Gaming Control Board lifted the face-covering rule for casinos ""unless a local jurisdiction still imposes such a requirement,"" and masks were not required for schools beginning Friday morning.

Masks may still be required in hospitals, clinics and long-term care facilities, at airports and on aircraft and on public buses and school buses.

However, Sisolak said masks aren’t mandatory anymore in jails and correctional facilities.

The governor – who is seeking re-election in November – also highlighted a steep decline in COVID-19 cases since the January peak of the omicron variant.

New cases there average about 1,280 each day, compared with 7,865 on Jan. 10.

STATES LIFT MASK MANDATES FOR ADULTS IN BARS AND RESTAURANTS BUT STILL REQUIRE KIDS AT SCHOOL TO MASK UP

The spread of the virus in Nevada remains far above federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) thresholds for positivity and new cases per population of 100,000.

""I want to be clear, the emergency is not over,"" Sisolak said. ""The pandemic is not over. We’re still getting far too many cases, far too many hospitalizations and far too many deaths.""

""I’m hopeful and confident, based on the data we have, we are in a good positions to drop this and to give people back some freedom. Everyone wants to get back to their normal life ... I mean, it's been two years. I think the time has come,"" he added.

Nationally, cases and hospitalizations have dropped, though deaths are still above pandemic peaks.

Data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center showed 3,179 new deaths and 147,416 new cases.

An epidemiological report from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that case counts fell 50% in the U.S. and 17% globally.

Across the U.S., COVID-19 hospitalizations have dropped nearly 30% over the past three weeks.

A vast majority of Americans are protected against serious illness from the highly transmissible variant – which makes up 99.9% of cases – by effective vaccines and boosters.

While many states have taken steps to lift mandates or loosen restrictions, the CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks indoors in places of ""substantial or high transmission"" of the virus.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this week that residents should still continue to follow guidance from the agency in states where masking is no longer recommended.

The head of the WHO issued a warning Wednesday stressing that ""COVID isn’t through with us,"" although its focus was more on vaccinations than masks.

2022-02-11 10:45:00+00:00,25,"Several Democrat-led states are finally scaling back on masking requirements, citing declining COVID-19 case numbers for the changes rather than scientific evidence that they are not needed.

In recent days, New Jersey, New York, California, Connecticut, Oregon and Delaware have all announced new masking policies for at least some places or segments of the population.

DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO REVERSE COURSE ON COVID RESTRICTIONS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS

""We felt with a four-week runway, based on our dropping in cases, hospitalizations, in-school transmission, increasing in vaccinations, God willing the under-5 kids being eligible sooner than later, a little bit warmer weather a month from now — that combination has allowed us to take this step,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told MSNBC earlier this week. Murphy is lifting his state’s mask mandate for schools and day cares effective March 7.

‘Dramatic decline’

Similarly, Connecticut is eliminating its statewide mandate by Feb. 28, leaving it up to local school officials to decide what is best for their students. Gov. Ned Lamont, like Murphy, also pointed to case numbers and vaccinations.

""Connecticut is seeing a dramatic decline in cases caused by the Omicron variant, and children over the age of 5 have had the ability to get vaccinated for more than three months now,"" Lamont said in a statement Monday. ""With this in mind, I think we are in a good position to phase out the requirement that masks be worn in all schools statewide and shift the determination on whether to require this to the local level.""

‘Much better place’

In Delaware, the statewide school mask mandate will expire at the end of March. For other indoor public places, masks will no longer be required as of Feb. 11.

""We’re in a much better place than we were several weeks ago,"" Gov. John Carney tweeted before adding, ""We have the tools to keep ourselves and each other safe. Get vaccinated. Get your booster. That’s especially important for children, where we continue to see low rates of vaccination.""

Easing restrictions

California and New York are not lifting school mask mandates yet, but they are easing restrictions elsewhere. The Golden State is letting its indoor mask mandate expire next week for those who are vaccinated. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) pointed to lower rates of spread and hospitalizations since the height of the omicron variant, as well as the existence of pharmaceutical options.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS REELECTION CHAIR CALLS FOR ROLLING BACK COVID RESTRICTIONS TO ‘GIVE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK’

""Omicron has loosened its hold on California, vaccines for children under 5 are around the corner, and access to COVID-19 treatments is improving,"" Dr. Tomás J. Aragón, California's public health officer, said in a statement. ""With things moving in the right direction, we are making responsible modifications to COVID-19 prevention measures, while also continuing to develop a longer-term action plan for the state.""

Masks were ""effective"" in explaining why the school requirement remains in effect, the CDPH still maintained.

""California’s common sense policies like masking have resulted in some of the lowest COVID rates and closures,"" the agency told Fox News. ""Schools, unlike other settings do not have testing or vaccine verification requirements and as such, indoor masking remains an effective way to reduce spread.""

Downward trends

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also pointed to downward trends in cases, positivity rate, and hospitalizations in support of her decision to lift a mask mandate for indoor businesses.

""This is trending in a very, very good direction,"" Hochul said at a Wednesday news briefing.

When asked why high schools, where there are high levels of vaccinations, are being treated differently from businesses, Hochul said students are in ""a very concentrated setting"" without much freedom of movement, and ""adults can make their own decision.""

The above states point to trends in infection rates and hospitalizations as well as the existence of vaccines and treatments, which have been in existence for months or longer. Fox News asked California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Delaware if their decisions were based on any new data. Only California responded, only to say that ""the state has experienced a 65% decrease in case rates,"" with no mention of data specifically dealing with masks.

2022-02-11 10:00:01+00:00,64,"ABC daytime gabfest ""The View"" has produced plenty of melodramatic commentary, viral moments and occasional outright misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here are 10 examples.

1. Sunny Hostin suggests ‘1 percent' of youths who get COVID-19 will die

Co-host Sunny Hostin drastically overstated the percentage of coronavirus deaths among younger people during a Tuesday discussion on the liberal daytime talk show over the lifting of mask mandates in schools.

Hostin said she didn't want her children to be part of the ""one percent"" of those who get intubated and die from COVID-19, but federal health data shows the risk of dying for those under 17 from COVID-19 is far less than that.

""You see, I don't want to take the chance with my kid. I don't want my kid to be part of the one percent that is intubated and dies because I don't give her a vaccine,"" she said, noting she had gotten her 15-year-old daughter vaccinated when the shots became available.

According to the CDC there have been 770 deaths from the coronavirus in children up to age 17, through the end of January. There have been nearly 10 million known cases of the coronavirus in the same age group, making the death rate approximately 0.008%, with countless cases unreported.

2. Hostin defends Sotomayor's false claim

Hostin went to bat for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor after Sotomayor said during oral arguments last month that more than 100,000 children were in serious condition from COVID-19, claiming many were on ventilators.

Hostin suggested that despite being nowhere close to the actual figure, Sotomayor was making a valid point about the rise in hospitalizations amid the omicron variant. While there were more children hospitalized then than at any point during the pandemic, according to the CDC, the seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was around 3,700 that week, according to the Washington Post.

""Well, first, I just want to re-frame this a little bit about Justice Sotomayor,"" Hostin said. ""Because while she may not be accurate for current hospitalizations in children, she is correct that we have more children in the hospital now, more than ever before.""

Hostin didn't stop there. Looking at her notes, she said ""right now,"" there were 82,843 children sick with COVID-19. However, that figure referred to the total number of hospital admissions of children confirmed with COVID-19 since August 2020, according to a Washington Post fact-check.

BILL MAHER SLAMS CANCEL CULTURE AFTER WHOOPI GOLDBERG, JEFF ZUCKER SCANDALS

Hostin went on to state more than 1,000 children had died of COVID; according to the CDC, the number as of February was 795 in the United States for those aged 0-17. That number accounts for less than 0.09 percent of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States, according to the CDC.

""That's a real thing and those are real numbers,"" Hostin said.

3. Sara Haines: Permanent indoor mask-wearing?

Co-host Sara Haines remarked last month that part of the ""new normal"" in the COVID and post-COVID era could mean people engaging in permanent indoor mask-wearing.

""I may never ride a subway again without a mask. I may never go indoors to big crowds and ever feel comfortable without a mask, and that's up to me to do that,"" Haines said.

On Twitter, after a news site clipped her remarks, Haines maintained she opposed shutdowns, school closures and mask mandates for future, less severe variants of the virus like omicron, given the availability of vaccines.

4. Whoopi Goldberg rips Bill Maher

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg erupted on HBO late-night host Bill Maher last month after the comedian criticized the ""masked, paranoid world"" of people and governments still insisting on stringent coronavirus routines. Maher has been critical of how liberal media has reported on the virus and noted Democrats were more likely to believe severe COVID-19 outcomes would occur ""if they contract it.""

Goldberg lashed out at Maher, telling him to ""stay away from everybody"" if he decided he no longer wanted to follow any of the measures used to prevent spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, and argued he was forgetting that some at-risk people were still unable to get vaccinated. She at one point snapped, ""How dare you be so flippant?""

""That’s not really funny to people who've lost their kids … or people who've lost family members or dear friends to this,"" Goldberg said. ""Nobody on the planet really wants to go through this. This is not something we’re doing because it’s, you know, sexually gratifying.""

""If you're the one who’s not paying attention, and you’re coughing and sneezing … then stay out of the public, man,"" she added. ""Nobody wants this. I don’t want it. And I think he’s forgetting that people are still at risk who cannot get vaccinated … little kids under the age of five, or people with health conditions.""

5. Co-hosts exit before Kamala Harris interview

In one of the more bizarre moments in recent live television history, Hostin and co-host Ana Navarro were informed in the middle of a broadcast Sept. 24 that they had tested positive for COVID and needed to leave immediately.

As Joy Behar was set to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris for her first live television interview since taking office, a producer told Navarro and Hostin to leave the stage. Behar revealed after a commercial break that the two had received positive coronavirus tests and had to leave as a precaution.

As the show scrambled to set up a video feed for Harris to be interviewed from backstage, remaining co-hosts Behar and Haines took audience questions for nearly the rest of the episode. The awkward television that ensued lit up social media, as the masked audience members were difficult to hear. The co-hosts crammed in a brief interview with Harris at the end of the program.

‘VIEW’ CO-HOST SUNNY HOSTIN CALLS ON ALLISON GOLLUST TO LEAVE CNN OVER ZUCKER RELATIONSHIP

It was later revealed, however, that both Hostin and Navarro had received false positive results and never had COVID-19. Hostin was particularly upset by the spectacle, as both of her husband's parents died of COVID-19.

In yet another example of melodramatic coronavirus commentary, Navarro said when she returned to the program she had feared for a moment she could ""wipe out"" Harris and her family because she had spent time with them earlier that day.

6. Hostin asks if Republicans 'want their voters to die'

Hostin questioned Republicans’ strategy of opposing vaccine mandates, such as Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Although DeSantis has promoted vaccinations , Hostin suggested that politicians like him ""want their voters to die"" by not getting the vaccine.

""So the Republican strategy is to tell their constituency not to get the vaccine, so do they want their voters to die? Like, those are the people that are supporting the Republicans. That part I don’t understand,"" Hostin said in December.

7. Goldberg stunned by testing positive

Goldberg channeled the energy of many media liberals who were shocked they could still contract COVID-19 despite being vaccinated and engaging in precautionary measures.

""I left a couple of weeks ago, just before the break, because somebody I had been around tested positive for coronavirus, so I left. So I've been gone a long time, I feel,"" Goldberg said Jan. 5.

""And I was all excited and, you know, they have to test us, and so they sent people to test me, and they tested me, and it was like, ‘Oh no you’re not coming back. We’re not sending anybody to your house. You have corona.’ And it was like, wait what?"" she added.

‘THE VIEW’S' WILDEST, MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS FROM 2021

Goldberg stated that her shock came from the fact that she was fully vaccinated, had received the vaccine booster shot and hadn't gone anywhere other than her house or ""done anything."" Goldberg returned to the show less than a week later.

Vaccines have been highly effective in preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death from COVID-19, but it came as a shock to many when they were still contracting and transmitting the virus, even after getting boosters.

8. Hostin touts conspiracy theory about Ron DeSantis

As the response to COVID-19 has been tied up with politics for the past two years, ""The View"" has gone to bat against some of its political foes over their handling of the situation, in particular Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

CONSERVATIVES ARGUE AGAINST WHOOPI GOLDBERG'S SUSPENSION BY ABC: ‘ILLIBERAL AND IMMORAL’

""For those people that think Governor DeSantis, DeathSantis, is doing such a great job in Florida, well, he's not doing such a great job because there are allegations that he hid the death numbers. There are allegations – and now he doesn't want mask mandates,"" she said in August, according to NewsBusters. ""He's coming after Joe Biden, which is absolutely ridiculous. We know this is all political. He wants to run for president.""

Hostin appeared to be parroting heavily disputed claims by former Florida health department geographer Rebekah Jones that she was ordered to fudge COVID-19 data and was fired for refusing, as well as a widely panned Yahoo story that accused the state of undercounting deaths.

Florida has the 18th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country during the pandemic. Mississippi has the worst, followed by Arizona, New Jersey, Alabama, Louisiana and New York, according to The New York Times.

9. Navarro frets over Stacey Abrams' maskless photo

The hosts of ""The View"" were sharply critical of Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams this week after photos went viral of her maskless at a school, where children and adults around her were forced to wear masks. Usually admiring of the gubernatorial hopeful, the hosts said Abrams' action was ""hypocritical"" and a major unforced error.

Navarro's critique came from a point of Abrams putting the children in danger, however, despite data consistently showing they are at scant risk of severe COVID outcomes, even if they aren't vaccinated.

""How could she not be much more careful in a room full of such small children?"" she asked. ""Stupid thing to do.""

Much of the criticism of Abrams from the right stemmed from her not following protocols she insists children abide by, but Republicans have largely opposed school mask mandates as unnecessary and even harmful to youth development and mental health. Abrams continues to support them.

10. Tennis star scolded over vaccine stance

Novak Djokovic, who is not vaccinated against COVID-19, was scolded by panelists on ABC’s ""The View"" last month after the top-ranked tennis star’s appeal against an Australian deportation order was dismissed, costing him a chance to play in the Australian Open.

""Here is the bottom line, people are not putting up with it. Countries are not putting up with it, because it means that every time you sneeze or talk, you are spreading more hassle for them. They’re trying to clean their country up. They’re trying to put everybody in a mask and here you come, and you think tennis needs you that badly? No, honey, no,"" Goldberg said .

The hosts also clashed with guest Michele Tafoya, an NBC sportscaster who is vaccinated, last year when she expressed opposition to vaccine mandates. The hosts derided that stance as selfish.

2022-02-10 21:50:00+00:00,19,"It’s been widely reported there is a shortage of teachers these days. But there’s a growing crisis of those who will lead them. School superintendents are leaving the profession in droves with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 departing this academic year, according to Ray & Associates consulting firm, which works with school boards to find candidates.

There is no doubt COVID-19, mask mandates, virtual learning and more are contributing factors, but that isn’t the entire picture.

""Superintendents are spending a lot of time addressing socio-political concerns and not nearly the amount of time they want to spend on the development and the educational attainment of students,"" Michael Collins, president of Ray & Associates, told Fox News.

Another factor is once sleepy school board meetings have gotten heated in recent months as parents have grown more frustrated over COVID issues and about what is being taught in classrooms.

With meetings being streamed online, a superintendent candidate can see the challenges and tensions in a particular school district early on in the interview process.

""They always did their homework, but now they have the opportunity to see board members to see where they stand on the political realm and how they interact with one another before even submitting an application,"" Molly Schwarzhoff, executive vice president of Ray & Associates, said.

""It's just important that those boards realize that they're being observed, and they're being interviewed. It's a two-way street now. That's kind of what COVID has done is they've opened up this two-way street for interviews.""

Debra Pace is the superintendent of Osceola, Florida, schools. She leads a school district with 70,000 students and describes it as a 24/7 year-round job.

Pace says she’s stayed in her position in part because Osceola is her home, and her children have been educated in the school system there.

""I particularly feel a strong need to get us to the other side of the pandemic, to get us back to a true sense of what's normal and, more importantly, to help kids catch up from the learning that's been lost and to help support our teachers and know that I'm here for them,"" Pace told Fox News.

MASK MANDATES EASED ACROSS US AS COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS DROP BELOW 100,000

Pace says superintendents leaning on each other has been a huge help.

""Certainly, as we're all facing the same challenges with masks and no masks and face-to-face learning versus digital learning and the social emotional needs of our kids now that they are all back in the building,"" Pace said. ""And even our staff, we're really still seeing the stress of the pandemic on their shoulders. So that concept of ‘phone a friend’ is really, really helpful to help you problem solve.""

2022-02-10 20:30:00+00:00,18,"Several states announced Wednesday that they would ease mask mandates as the surge of the omicron variant of the coronavirus continues to show signs of slowing.

In New York, where the variant of concern began infecting huge numbers in December, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state would end the mandate requiring face coverings in most indoor public settings.

Masking rules would be kept in place for schools, and the governor said infection rates and hospitalizations have declined in the Empire State to a level where it is safe to rescind the Dec. 10 order.

""This fight is not over, we’re not surrendering. This is not disarmament,"" she told reporters, ""but again the trends are very, very positive.""

Masks will still be required in some places in the state, including health care facilities, types of shelters and public transit.

CDC DIRECTOR WALENSKY ON DROPPING COVID RESTRICTIONS: 'WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET'

In the first week of March, the state will revisit whether to continue requiring masks in schools, Hochul said.

Also on Wednesday, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he would lift the state's requirement for wearing face coverings in most indoor spaces but that the mandate will stay in place for K-12 schools.

Masks will no longer be required to enter restaurants, grocery stores or other indoor spaces in Illinois starting on Feb. 28.

""Vaccines work. Masks work,"" the governor said at a news briefing. ""And, as a result of them and the tremendous commitment of our state’s residents, we are on track to come out on the other side of this latest COVID storm in better shape than even the doctors expected.""

Pritzker also cited plummeting hospitalization numbers.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said Wednesday that students and staff at the state's public schools won't have to wear face coverings indoors, also beginning on Feb. 28. Masks will still be on required on school buses, per federal regulations.

""Given the extremely low risk to young people, the widespread availability and the proven effectiveness of vaccines, and the distribution of accurate test protocols and tests, it’s time to give our kids a sense of normalcy and lift the mask mandate on a statewide basis for schools,"" the governor told reporters.

Rhode Island will lift its mask or proof-of-vaccination requirement for indoor businesses on Friday.

Gov. Dan McKee said Wednesday that the state plans on ending its school mask mandate early next month.

""We are in a much better place than we were in January,"" he explained, citing the state of the pandemic in Rhode Island.

Earlier this week, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and Oregon also announced plans to end statewide school mask mandates by the end of February or March.

FAUCI SAYS ‘FULL-BLOWN’ COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS ALMOST OVER IN US

On Monday, state health officials in California said the state would end its indoor masking requirement for vaccinated people next week.

Masks for schoolchildren are still the rule there, but authorities said that they are ""continuing to work with education, public health and community leaders to update masking requirements at schools to adapt to changing conditions and ensure the safety of kids, teachers and staff.""

Some districts have continued to require masks despite the end of statewide mandates, and others have made them optional.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends masks for students and staff inside buildings and says that anyone who is 2 years or older and not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines should wear a mask indoors in public.

Those who are up to date with vaccines should wear a mask indoors in public in areas of substantial or high transmission, and wearing a mask is required on public transportation and at transportation hubs.

On Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that the agency was working on mask-wearing guidance and following trends.

""What I will say, though is, you know, our hospitalizations are still high, our death rates are still high,"" she noted, echoing comments from previous interviews. ""So, as we work towards that and as we are encouraged by the current trends, we are not there yet.""

Walensky has said she is ""cautiously optimistic"" about declining cases and hospitalizations.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser for President Biden, said in a Tuesday interview with the Financial Times that the U.S. is almost past the ""full-blown"" pandemic phase of the coronavirus.

The White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Wednesday that the nation is ""moving toward a time when COVID won’t disrupt our daily lives.""

""The president, as I just mentioned, has been clear that we’re moving toward a time when COVID won’t disrupt our daily lives, a time when COVID won’t be a constant crisis so we’re no longer fearing lockdowns and shutdowns, but getting back to safely doing what we all love. In doing so, we will rely on the powerful set of tools that have been built: the vaccines, the booster shots, treatments and testing,"" he said, noting that the White House would ""continue to coordinate closely with state and local leaders.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration wants to ""ensure that public health guidance we’re providing meets the moment we’re in,"" and that there are positive signs in the data.

In states where masking is no longer recommended, she told reporters that residents should still continue to follow CDC guidance.

While omicron has appeared to calm in states around the country and data from Health and Human Services (HHS) shows COVID-19 hospitalizations have dropped below 100,000, the threat of another variant emerging continues to loom.

Deaths are still exceeding previous pandemic peaks in the U.S., and the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center showed that tally at 3,435 in the past day, with new cases now just 215,748 – down from more than a million last month.

""It is fair, I think, to say that it has been when truly tested that the Trust has shown its most outstanding qualities of resilience and commitment to helping people across South Asia,"" said Charles, as quoted by his official Instagram page.

""When the pandemic first hit us, the Trust launched an Emergency Appeal to support migrant workers and those most in need across the region,"" he shared. ""I was delighted to be able to give my own support, together with so many in the diaspora, to help over 150,000 people.""

The study found an increased risk of 20 different heart and vessel issues for those who’ve had the virus a year earlier, Science magazine reported.

""Governments and health systems around the world should be prepared to deal with the likely significant contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic to a rise in the burden of cardiovascular diseases,"" the paper read, according to the report.

Eric Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Research, told the magazine that he was surprised by the findings and called the ailments ""serious disorders.""

""If anybody ever thought that COVID was like the flu this should be one of the most powerful data sets to point out it’s not,"" he said, referring to the study that ran in Nature Medicine earlier this week.

Reuters reported that the study found that those who recovered from the virus had about a 63% higher risk of having a heart attack and a 52% greater risk of stroke one year later. The news outlet also said those who recovered had a 72% higher risk of heart failure. The elevated risks seemed to impact everyone, regardless of sex, age or whether there were pre-existing conditions, the report said. The magazine pointed out that even those who were not hospitalized also had greater risk of cardiovascular disease.

The magazine said the analysis was based on data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and included health information from 154,000 people who had the virus. The control groups included millions who received care at these facilities during that pandemic and in 2017.

""The president has been clear and has said that we are moving toward a time when COVID won’t disrupt our daily lives – a time when COVID won’t be a constant crisis,"" Psaki said Wednesday during the White House press briefing. ""There's an active and ongoing work plan to develop a path forward, and there’s constant discussion about that.""

Psaki said Biden administration officials ""want to ensure the public health guidance we’re providing meets the moment we’re in.""

""We recognize people are tired of the pandemic, they’re tired of wearing masks, I bet you all are, I certainly know I am. We all understand that,"" Psaki said. ""But what our focus is on is looking at the data and science.""

BLUE STATES DROPPING STUDENT MASK MANDATES: IS THAT MOVE OVERDUE?

Psaki pointed to ""positive"" data suggesting that hospitalizations and cases of COVID-19 are ""falling,"" but said officials continue to base guidance for restrictions off of the ""latest data and science.""

Psaki, pointing to comments made by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky, saying that she is continuing ""to recommend masking in areas of high and substantial transmission, which is basically the entire country at this point.""

Psaki said officials are ""evaluating rates of transmission"" and looking at data to ""see if any changes need to be made.""

""And that is something, of course, the CDC continues to do,"" Psaki explained.

""So, I would say that we are internally discussing, of course, what it looks like to be in the phase of the fight against the COVID pandemic where it is not disrupting everyone’s daily lives, where people are moving on and living, you know, lives free of, hopefully, masks, at some point, and many of the restrictions that we’ve all been living through over the past two years,"" Psaki said.

""But, as the federal government, we have a responsibility to rely on data, on science, on the medical experts. That's something the president committed to during the campaign,"" Psaki added.

NEW YORK TO LIFT INDOOR MASK MANDATE, BUT NOT FOR KIDS IN SCHOOLS

As for the decisions made by governors to lift restrictions, Psaki said the White House is ""continuing to convey directly to governors a recommendation that they abide by federal public health guidelines, but also our understanding and that that they may make decisions based on what they feel is best for their communities.""

On Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul became the latest Democratic state leader to lift the statewide indoor mask mandate. Mask mandates for schools and childcare centers, healthcare facilities, homeless shelters, and corrections facilities in the Empire State are still in place.

Hochul said she spoke to Dr. Anthony Fauci, healthcare leaders, business leaders, school superintendents, and teachers unions before making her decisions.

NEW JERSEY WILL ELIMINATE SCHOOL MASK MANDATE FOR CHILDREN AND STAFF

Hochul's decision to keep the school mask mandate in place for now follows announcements from other blue states including New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware, that they will be lifting school mask mandates. Connecticut’s statewide mandate will expire Feb. 28 and New Jersey’s will be lifted as of March 7. Delaware's on March 31.

Asked whether she would consider lifting the school mask mandate on March 7 after students come back from their break and the state looks at test results, Hochul said, ""That is a very strong possibility.""

He did not mention a specific month or season but told the paper that these restrictions — including mask mandates — could end ""soon.""

2022-02-08 19:13:41+00:00,21,"Research has reportedly identified a spike in cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or ""broken heart syndrome,"" over the course of the coronavirus pandemic.

Experts said the potentially fatal stress-induced heart condition is disproportionately affecting women.

FEBRUARY IS AMERICAN HEART MONTH: WHAT TO KNOW

""I don't know how much we can really blame COVID, or how much of this is that we're just recognizing more of it,"" Dr. Noel Bairey Merz, director of the Barbra Streisand Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, told ""Good Morning America"" on Monday. ""But, heart disease is the leading killer of women and all ages, including teenagers, midlife women and older women. This is just a component of that major killer. So, it's really something that needs to be addressed.""

Merz said one in five of those who suffer from the heart-brain disorder will have another attack within a decade.

In an October news release, Cedars-Sinai shared Smidt Heart Institute research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which suggests that middle-aged and older women are being diagnosed up to 10 times more often than younger women or men of any age.

The study suggested that the condition has become more common, with incidences rising since well before coronavirus swept the globe.

""Although the global COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges and stressors for women, our research suggests the increase in Takotsubo diagnoses was rising well before the public health outbreak,"" Susan Cheng, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute and senior author of the study, said in a statement. ""This study further validates the vital role the heart-brain connection plays in overall health, especially for women.""

MEN WHO TEND TO WORRY HAVE INCREASED RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE, STROKE: STUDY

Cheng and her team used national hospital data from more than 135,000 men or women diagnosed with Takotsubo syndrome between 2006 and 2017 to reach these conclusions.

Researchers are still working to investigate the longer-term implications of the diagnosis and its risk factors.

According to Harvard University, citing the American Heart Journal, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a weakening of the left ventricle – the heart's main pumping chamber – usually due to severe emotional or physical stress.

The main symptoms of broken heart syndrome include chest pain and shortness of breath, and the Mayo Clinic notes that it can mimic a heart attack.

The clinic and Harvard both note that the precise cause of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not clear, but that some believe a squeezing of the large or small arteries or changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels could play a role.

The number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fell from 22,302 the previous week to 10,435 last week.

The seven-day rolling average also declined from 4,163 new cases per day on Jan. 22 to 1,490.71 new cases per day on Saturday.

In Minnesota, The Star Tribune reported Monday that officials said daily deaths had plateaued and that hospitalizations on Friday marked a 24% decrease from Jan. 19.

The publication said the positivity rate of COVID-19 testing had also declined.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear reported a significant decline in weekly cases on Monday.

New coronavirus cases statewide dropped from 74,300 to more than 46,000 last week.

Beshear said the winter storm that swept the state might have held down the weekly number, which still represents Kentucky's fifth-highest weekly case number during the pandemic.

As cases fall, some states are moving to lift restrictions.

California will end its indoor masking requirement for vaccinated people next week, though officials announced Monday that masks are still the rule for schoolchildren.

The Wall Street Journal noted last week that public-health authorities often tightly regulate laboratories that analyzed COVID-19 tests, but don't closely monitor sites conducting the tests.

The FTC instructs people to go to sites where they have been referred to by a doctor or the state or local health department's website, check the source of a new testing site and contact their local police or sheriff's office.

For those who believe they already went to a fake site and shared their credit card information, the FTC advises consumers to dispute the charge and report fake COVID-19 testing sites to ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

""A legitimate company or health clinic will not call, text or email you without your permission. If you receive an unsolicited message, do not provide the caller or sender with personal information until you have confirmed it is a legitimate source.

Kluge said the period of ""higher protection"" should be seen as a ""cease-fire"" that could bring the region ""enduring peace"" on the condition that it continues to vaccinate and boost, there is strong governmental oversight and commitment with a focus on the ""five stabilizers for the most vulnerable"" and that the region promotes self-protecting behavior and individual responsibility.

He also told reporters that he believes it is possible to respond to any new variants of concern that will ""inevitably emerge"" ""without re-installing the kind of disruptive measures we needed before.""

Kluge said that it is because the organization sees the top priority as bringing all countries to a level of protection that allows them to ""grasp this opportunity and look ahead towards more stable days"" – a future that demands a ""drastic and uncompromising increase in vaccine-sharing across borders.""

""We cannot accept vaccine inequity for one more day,"" he urged, echoing previous calls from WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Kluge pointed out that the hospitalizations in the European region were on the rise – mainly in the unvaccinated – and that it had recorded 12 million new cases in the past week: the highest weekly case incidence since the start of the pandemic.

In addition, masks will still be required indoors until the county records two consecutive weeks at or below ""moderate"" transmission of the virus, and officials will not further rescind masking requirements unless there are no reports of significantly circulating variants of concern that have the ability to threaten vaccine effectiveness.

Masks also still would have to be worn where required by the state or federal government, The Times noted.

Recently, the city of San Francisco changed its mask mandate, implementing new vaccination requirements and allowing people heading to offices, gyms and other indoor spaces with ""stable"" groups of people to shed masks.

A stable group is defined as any group of 100 or fewer people where everyone is vaccinated and the population is recurrent, The San Francisco Chronicle explained.

California's indoor mask mandate is set to expire on Feb. 15.

Los Angeles County says everyone – regardless of vaccination status – must wear a mask in all indoor public settings, venues, gatherings and public and private businesses.

Additionally, masks are required on all forms of public transportation and transportation hubs, as well as in health care settings.

Residents may remove their masks when actively eating or drinking as long as they are sitting or standing in a specific place, showering or swimming or receiving personal hygiene or personal care services that cannot be done without removing the mask.

Children younger than 2 years old, people with certain medical conditions or disabilities and some instructed by their medicinal provider should not wear a mask.

Kids ages 2 to 8 years old should wear a mask only when under adult supervision.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people, in general, do not need to wear a mask when outdoors – but that some people might choose to wear one when in sustained close contact with others in areas of substantial or high transmission.

Los Angeles County data shows, as of Feb. 2, the number of current hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients was 3,398.

The dashboard also shows that the seven-day daily reported percent of COVID-19 tests that are positive is 10.73%.

YOUNGKIN'S MASK MANDATE: VIRGINIA JUDGE WEIGHS GOVERNOR'S POWER TO LIFT DECREE

""This is what so many people had been talking about for so long. That it does not really have an effect on how well we were able to go through it,"" House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News Thursday.

""But what does it have an effect on, all these shutdowns? How many people missed a cancer screening? The mental health, the suicides for young children. This shutdown is going to have effects for decades to come.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a staunch opponent of Washington-led pandemic policies and a fierce critic of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, said he hopes the country learns from this experience.

""In the 14th century, the pope surrounded himself with candles because they thought the infection could be burned out of the air to save people,"" Paul told Fox News’ ""America Reports"" on Wednesday. ""It was a wrong-handed notion. It took a few centuries – really to the 19th century – to understand the germ theory. Now we have lockdowns, which are not based in science, and really we know that by and large masks did not work, Plexiglas did not work and six feet of distance did not work. The one thing we do know that did work is vaccines and natural immunity.""

""I hope we learn from this,"" Paul added. ""The study is an extensive analysis looking at dozens and dozens of studies — bringing them together — and said lockdowns did not reduce mortality but were devastating to the economy.""

TOP OVERSIGHT REPUBLICANS CALL ON 7 SCIENTISTS TO TESTIFY ON COVID ORIGINS, WUHAN LAB LEAK

Christina Pushaw, press secretary for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, pointed to the study as support for DeSantis’s anti-lockdown, anti-mandate approach to the pandemic, for which he had been blasted by critics.

""For nearly two years, corporate media and partisan opponents have targeted Governor DeSantis with relentless criticism for taking a strong stand against lockdowns,"" Pushaw said in a statement to Fox News.

""In Spring 2020, they attacked him for refusing to close Florida’s beaches. In Summer 2020, they attacked him for opening schools. In Spring 2021, they attacked him for ending local emergency orders in the few counties that still attempted to impose restrictions. In Fall 2021, they attacked him for appointing State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, an eminently qualified physician who immediately ended the forced quarantine of healthy schoolchildren.""

Pushaw said DeSantis ""followed the science and made data-driven decisions"" while others ""sowed fear to achieve greater political power and control.""

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., encouraged experts to conduct studies that examine how the country handled the pandemic, noting that he had not yet read the Johns Hopkins study.

""We need to take a look back and find out what we did right, what we did wrong,"" Kennedy told Fox News.

""I remember when government at all levels imposed the first lockdown,"" Kennedy added. ""They told us it was only going to be for a couple of weeks. It wasn’t for a couple of weeks.

Kennedy added that while some officials were acting in good faith but got it wrong, others were acting in bad faith because they ""got a taste for power.""

Now, nearly two years after the first lockdown measures were put in place, Kennedy says Americans need to look back and consider whether it was worth it in the long run.

""Did it stop COVID? Doesn’t look to me like it did,"" Kennedy said. ""Did it gut the American economy like a fish? Yes. Did it set our kids back years in terms of learning and socialization? Yes.

The participants, who were unvaccinated and all between the ages of 18 and 30, were given the original SARS-CoV-2 strain through drops in the nose at the Royal Free Hospital in London, England.

Two of the participants were excluded from the study after contracting COVID-19 in between the screening and the experiment.

US DAILY COVID-19 CASES FALL BELOW 500K, DATA SHOWS

Of the 34 participants who were exposed, only 18 became infected. They were given the ""lowest possible dose of virus found to cause infection, roughly equivalent to the amount found in a single droplet of nasal fluid when participants were at their most infectious.""

Sixteen of the participants developed mild-to-moderate symptoms and the average incubation period was just 42 hours.

No serious adverse reactions were recorded in the study.

'STEALTH' OMICRON VARIANT BA.2 CIRCULATING IN ALMOST HALF OF US, BUT CDC EXERCISES CAUTION: REPORT

Each participant's viral load was checked twice a day using nasal swabs. Notably, there was no correlation between an individual's viral load and symptoms, with a high viral load found even during asymptomatic infection.

Viral loads peaked at five days on average, but levels of infectious virus were still detected up to nine days after inoculation.

The researchers are hopeful that the study provides a ""plug and play"" platform to study other variants and drugs.

""The trial has already provided some fascinating new insights into SARS-CoV2 infection, but perhaps its greatest contribution is to open up a new way to study the infection and the immune responses to it in great detail and help test new vaccines and treatments,"" Dr. Sir Michael Jacobs, consultant in infectious diseases at the Royal Free London, said in a statement.

""We’ve worked with our vendors to increase inventory of OTC COVID-19 tests and have removed all product limits on those products at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide and on CVS.com,"" a CVS spokesperson told FOX Business.

Although CVS said never ran out of stock, some areas had strained inventory as cases, driven by the omicron variant, mounted.

Likewise, a Walgreens spokesperson told FOX Business that it has worked with suppliers in order to ensure the company has ""enough supply to meet customer demand at nearly all locations.""

""Due to the improved in-stock conditions of at-home COVID-19 testing products, we have removed the purchase limit and we’ve reinstated Same Day Delivery and Pickup solutions for customers,"" the spokesperson said.

In December, CVS and Walgreens announced a limit on the amount of at-home tests customers can purchase due to the omicron variant, which is now the dominant variant in the U.S.

At the time, CVS customers were limited to six at-home test kits per purchase of its five over-the-counter offerings, including Abbott BinaxNOW, Acon FlowFlex, Quidel Quickvue, Ellume, and Pixel by LabCorp.

Walgreens had implemented a four-item purchase limit on-at-home COVID-19 testing products in its stores and digital properties as it worked with suppliers to improve its inventory.

Now, not only is there no longer a limit on the number of tests a consumer can purchase but the tests are also covered by most insurance policies.

The Biden administration announced in January that private health insurers will be required to cover up to eight home COVID-19 tests per month for people on their plans.

Americans will be able to either purchase home testing kits for free under their insurance or submit receipts for the tests for reimbursement, up to the monthly per-person limit.

The event was held at a private residence in Los Angeles, and Whitmer raised approximately $78,000 from the appearance. This was one stop on an apparent multi-day trip to California.

MICHIGAN GOV WHITMER UNDERWATER IN ELECTION YEAR AS OVER HALF OF VOTERS DISAPPROVE: POLL

Michigan had slightly more than 3,000 COVID-19 patients in hospitals during the week of Whitmer's trip. It was the first time it had crossed that threshold since spring, while nearly all hospital beds were occupied in Minnesota. Both held the unflattering rank of national virus hotspots.

""The more reports come out, the more we uncover about Gretchen Whitmer’s priorities, which are not to keep Michiganders safe, but rather, to ascend the political ladder while destroying livelihoods,"" Michigan GOP communications director Gustavo Portela told Fox News Digital.

The governor, who is up for reelection this year, has faced a series of struggles lately.

Whitmer is underwater, as over half of Wolverine State voters disapprove of her job performance, according to a recent poll.

Independent pollster EPIC MRA found last month that 52% of Michiganders who are likely to vote in the 2022 midterms do not approve of Whitmer’s job as governor, with only 45% saying she’s doing a good job.

A state auditor found last month that the number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities reported by the Whitmer administration was significantly lower than the actual number.

The chaplain, who spoke with Fox News Digital on the condition of anonymity, said he faces possible dismissal from the Navy after nearly two decades of service due to his refusal to get a vaccine.

He would miss out on crucial retirement pay and benefits if he's dismissed before hitting the 20-year mark.

MARINES’ CLAIM OF GRANTING 2 RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS

""It’s a kick in the gut for sure,"" the chaplain said. ""If I lose retirement benefits that way, that would be a pretty significant burden to me and my family. At the same time, this is a fight worth fighting. I do not think this is a lawful order.""

""I know this chaplain, and he represents everything that is good about how our military balances the right of faith and the needs of a fighting force,"" California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa told Fox New Digital. ""That the Biden mandate is trampling him along with our soldiers on the front lines makes crystal clear how wrong all this is.""

The chaplain, who is also a pastor, said his religious exemption request was recommended for approval by his commanding officer and his commanding officer’s boss, but it was ultimately rejected ""at the top.""

""I was actually pleasantly surprised,"" he said. ""I thought my commander was going to be completely opposed to the request, but when I saw on the paperwork that he actually recommended approval and then his boss also recommended approval – I mean, to me, it's not about me, it's a big Navy thing. I think the commanders on the ground, many of them see this for what it is, but our hands are tied, and we have a lot of yes men at the top. It's really bad.""

In addition to discussions with chaplains to determine whether they have a ""sincerely held belief,"" troops must meet with commanders and medical personnel, and then the final decision is made higher up the chain of command. The Navy has not approved any of the thousands of requests for religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine.

The rejection letter the chaplain received from Vice Admiral John B. Nowell Jr., provided to Fox News Digital, said, ""Your request for religious accommodation through waiver of immunization requirements is disapproved.""

""A waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on your readiness and the readiness of the Sailors who serve alongside you in both operational and non-operational (including training) environments,"" the letter stated, in part. ""I find that disapproval of your request for a waiver of immunization requirements is the least restrictive means available to preserve the Department of Defense’s compelling interest in military readiness, mission accomplishment and the health and safety of military service members.

""The Navy is a specialized community governed by a discipline separate from that of the rest of society,"" the letter added. ""While every Sailor is welcome to express a religion of choice or none at all, our greater mission sometimes requires reasonable restrictions. You have my sincere best wishes for your continued success in your Navy career.""

The chaplain said the letter of rejection was nearly identical to the other letters he’s seen.

""You can hold each of these up to the light, and they look exactly like everyone else,"" he said.

The chaplain pointed to the U.S. Marine Corps, which recently approved religious accommodations for three Marines while rejecting thousands more.

MARINES SAY THEY’RE BEING ‘CRUSHED’ OVER VACCINE REFUSAL: ‘A POLITICAL PURGE’

One active-duty Marine with a legal background who recently spoke with Fox News Digital said the Corps granted those exemptions just to give the appearance that the religious rights of service members are being respected and to ""alleviate some of the pressure off of themselves."" That officer said, however, that the Corps has not disclosed exactly why those Marines’ requests were granted approval so that others can follow suit.

The officer said at least a ""dozen or so"" chaplains in the Marines have also been denied a religious exemption.

""That they're getting away with it just absolutely astounds me,"" the chaplain said. ""I would have thought that if you grant one, you have to grant everyone, because or else they are picking and choosing which religion is valid and who's Constitutional rights under the First Amendment will be honored and whose will not. It's offensive to me as someone who loves the Constitution.""

""The whole thing is shrouded in secrecy,"" he added.

The chaplain said he has filed an appeal and that it is still pending along with many others.

""Nobody knows quite what to do with us while we're waiting for all of these appeals to be adjudicated,"" he said. ""I am in limbo. I'm waiting to hear back on the appeal. Meanwhile, we're all sort of second-class citizens because we haven't had the jab.""

He said he believes service members are being used as ""test subjects"" with a vaccine that’s is still being studied.

""I honestly think that the push for 100% vaccination has to do with eliminating anything that looks like a control group,"" he said. ""I think that there's probably money involved somewhere. I think that the military has been a nice little test group, a set of test subjects that really can't say no.""

The CDC has repeatedly said that the vaccines are safe for use, and studies have shown that unvaccinated COVID patients are far more likely to die from the virus than vaccinated patients.

Last month, a federal judge in Texas granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors who refused on religious grounds to comply with the vaccine mandate. However, there was no indication that the order would affect service members beyond those 35 sailors.

Judge Reed O'Connor, in issuing the order, said, ""There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""

Judge Paul Magnuson said the trial for J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao won’t resume until Monday. They are accused of depriving Floyd of his rights when they failed to give him medical aid as Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on the Black man’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes while Floyd was handcuffed, facedown and gasping for air.

Kueng and Thao are also accused of failing to intervene in the May 2020 killing that triggered protests worldwide and a reexamination of racism and policing.

The judge said that one of the defendants tested positive for COVID-19, but he didn’t specify who, and a news release from the courthouse identified the infected person only as a ""case participant."" Reporters in the courtroom said Kueng and Thao were present, while Lane was not. Lane’s attorney declined to say whether his client had COVID-19.

GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: EX-MINNEAPOLIS COPS' ATTORNEYS QUESTION POLICE TRAINING

The court’s news release said the defendant with COVID would be tested again before the trial resumes, as will all other case participants who had been near that person.

Testimony began last week after a jury was quickly selected Jan. 20. Magnuson ordered the selection of six alternates instead of the usual two in case any jurors become ill or have to drop out.

To ensure social distancing, Magnuson set limits on who may be present in the courtroom. That includes allowing four pool reporters, plus a sketch artist, along with a limited number of family and friends of the officers and Floyd. Everyone entering the courtroom is asked COVID about symptoms.

The general public and other journalists can watch a closed-circuit TV feed in separate rooms.

Masks are mandatory for most people in the courthouse, as they are in public buildings across St. Paul and neighboring Minneapolis. The judge made an exception for himself, citing a chronic lung condition, and for witnesses when they’re testifying, so that their voices aren’t muffled. He rejected a request from an emergency room doctor who wanted to keep his mask on while testifying.

The courthouse is otherwise closed and has been fenced off due to security concerns. Most other federal court proceedings in Minnesota are being conducted by video or teleconference due to the pandemic, while state courts are using a mix of in-person and remote proceedings.

Like other places in the U.S., Minnesota saw an increase in cases as the highly contagious omicron variant took hold, but some key pandemic metrics have improved in recent weeks. According to data from the Minnesota Department of Health, the state’s positivity rate and new cases per 100,000 residents peaked around Jan. 11 at 23.6% and 238.6 cases, respectively and have fallen to 20.6% and 165.9 cases. New hospital admissions for COVID-19, a lagging indicator, are still close to their peak.

Testimony so far has come from the government’s witnesses, with defense attorneys expected to call witnesses later. Lane’s attorney has said his client will testify, but it’s not known if the other officers will.

Floyd, 46, struggled with officers when they tried to put him in a vehicle and after they put him on the ground. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs and Thao kept bystanders back.

Kueng, who is Black; Lane, who is white; and Thao, who is Hmong American, are charged with willfully depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights while acting under government authority. One count against all three officers alleges that they saw that Floyd needed medical care and failed to help. A count against Thao and Kueng contends that they didn’t intervene to stop Chauvin. Both counts allege that the officers’ actions resulted in Floyd’s death.

Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court last year and pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge. He remains in prison.

Army Secretary Christine Wormuth issued the directive for commanders to initiate involuntary administrative separation proceedings.

""Army readiness depends on Soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation’s wars,"" said Wormuth. ""Unvaccinated Soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness. We will begin involuntary separation proceedings for Soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption.""

The Army has said that more than 3,000 soldiers have been issued official written reprimands, which suggests they are already identified in the disciplinary process, and some of them could be among the first to be discharged. Overall, nearly 600 Marines, airmen and sailors have been thrown out of the military or dismissed from entry-level training at boot camps as of last week.

According to the announcement, Wormuth's order applies to ""regular Army soldiers, reserve-component Soldiers serving on Title 10 active-duty, and cadets."" Those with medical or religious exemption requests are temporarily exempt from the vaccination requirement but will need to start a vaccine regimen if their request is denied.

NAVY SHOULD BE HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR VIOLATING COURT ORDER ON COVID VACCINE EXEMPTIONS: COMPLAINT

If a soldier's request is denied, they can submit a final appeal but will have seven calendar days to start a regimen if that final appeal is also denied.

Wormuth's order took effect on Wednesday and could expand the number of legal challenges the U.S. military has already encountered from the mandate. Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday that a group of Navy SEALs is requesting a court hold the military branch in contempt for purportedly not complying with a judge's order to halt enforcement of the vaccine mandate.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has introduced legislation to block the mandate. Massie recently tweeted that he was ""contacted by members of our voluntary military who say they will quit if the COVID vaccine is mandated.""

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has also opposed the military's mandate, saying: ""Kicking thousands of young, healthy troops out of the military over the vaccine mandate hurts our national security.""

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) , which supports the military's mandate, told Fox News Digital that the coronavirus vaccine shouldn't be treated differently than others that members of the military have to receive.

""Members of the military are required to get numerous other vaccines and the COVID vaccine should be absolutely no different,"" MRFF President Michael Weinstein told Fox News Digital via email. Weinstein clarified that MRFF did not support a mere administrative discharge for those who refuse the vaccine. Instead, he said MRFF supported court-martial and receiving less than an honorable discharge.

ARMY HAS RELIEVED SIX ACTIVE-DUTY LEADERS, INCLUDING TWO BATALLION COMMANDERS, FOR REFUSING VACCINE

In January, the Navy announced it had discharged 20 sailors for refusing vaccination. At least six active-duty leaders have been relieved from the Army for refusing the vaccine.

On Wednesday, the Army said it ""has not yet involuntarily separated any Soldiers solely for refusing the lawful order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.""

""As of Jan. 26, Army commanders have relieved a total of six regular Army leaders, including two battalion commanders, and issued 3,073 general officer written reprimands to Soldiers for refusing the vaccination order.""

The Army said it would provide temporary exemptions for soldiers who ""will complete their separation or retirement, or begin transition leave, on or before July 1, 2022.""

The Army's policy provides that unvaccinated soldiers ""will be issued either an Honorable or General (under honorable conditions) characterization of service unless additional misconduct warrants separation with an Other than Honorable characterization of service.""

India Arie explained in an Instagram post that she has an issue with Rogan’s content beyond the pandemic. Instead, she notes that his ""language around race"" is what drove her to pull her content from Spotify.

""Neil Young opened a door that I MUST walk through,"" she wrote Monday.

""I believe in freedom of speech,"" The artist wrote. ""However, I find Joe Rogan problematic for reasons OTHER than his Covid interviews… FOR ME ITS ALL HIS language around race.""

She continued: ""What I am talking about is RESPECT - who gets it and who doesn’t. Paying musicians a Fraction of a penny? And HIM $100M? This shows the type of company they are and the company that they keep.""

Rogan is one of the streaming service's biggest stars, with a contract that could earn him more than $100 million. He released a video on Monday in which he addressed the recent criticism and defended the credentials of some of the more controversial guests he’s had on in recent months, specifically those who spoke about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.

""While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted,"" the researchers wrote. ""In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.""

The researchers – Johns Hopkins University economics professor Steve Hanke, Lund University economics professor Lars Jonung, and special advisor at Copenhagen's Center for Political Studies Jonas Herby – analyzed the effects of lockdown measures such as school shutdowns, business closures, and mask mandates on COVID-19 deaths.

""We find little to no evidence that mandated lockdowns in Europe and the United States had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality rates,"" the researchers wrote.

The researchers also examined shelter-in-place orders, finding that they reduced COVID-19 mortality by 2.9%.

Studies that looked at only shelter-in-place orders found they reduced COVID-19 mortality by 5.1%, but studies that looked at shelter-in-place orders along with other lockdown measures found that shelter-in-place orders actually increased COVID-19 mortality by 2.8%.

The researchers concluded that limiting gatherings may have actually increased COVID-19 mortality.

""[Shelter-in-place orders] may isolate an infected person at home with his/her family where he/she risks infecting family members with a higher viral load, causing more severe illness,"" the researchers wrote.

""But often, lockdowns have limited peoples’ access to safe (outdoor) places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe (indoor) places.""

The researchers also examined studies that focused on specific lockdown measures and found that the only intervention that reduced COVID-19 mortality was the closure of non-essential businesses, which reduced mortality by 10.6%, but this effect was likely driven by the closure of bars.

Researchers also pointed out other unintended consequences of lockdowns, such as rising unemployment, reduced schooling, an increase in domestic violence incidents, and surging drug overdoses.

From May 2020 to April 2021, the U.S. recorded 100,306 drug overdose deaths, a 28.5% increase from the 78,056 deaths that were recorded in the previous 12-month period, according to CDC data.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AT-HOME COVID TEST WEBSITE LAUNCHES

A study from the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice last year found that domestic violence incidents increased 8.1% in the U.S. after lockdown orders were issued.

About 97% of U.S. teachers said that their students have experienced learning loss during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Horace Mann survey last year.

The unemployment rate peaked nationwide at 14.8% in April 2020, but declined to 3.9% in December, which is still slightly higher than the 3.5% rate it was at in February 2020.

""These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best,"" the researchers in the Johns Hopkins University study wrote.

""Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion: lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.""

2022-02-02 02:00:00+00:00,15,"Washington Post reporter Philip Bump declared on Monday that he is ready to move on from worrying about murder and compared his feeling to those wanting to ""move on"" from COVID-19.

His analysis titled ""The deaths we’ve decided to accept"" appeared to take on a sardonic tone by making the comparison in the opening paragraphs.

""Guys, look. It’s been a rough few years, and I understand that. But I think you’ll agree when I say it’s simply time to move on. To start living our lives without fear. To stop trying to force folks to do things they don’t want to do simply to limit the small chance that people might die as a result,"" Bump wrote. ""So, I’ll say it: I’m ready to move on from worrying about murder.""

WHITE HOUSE, TOP DEMS APPARENTLY INFLUENCED BY WAPO’S JENNIFER RUBIN TO PUSH ELECTORAL COUNT REFORM

Bump went on to compare the number of murders to deaths from COVID.

""Overlaying the daily death toll with the country’s historic murder toll shows how the two figures compare. About a year ago, we were losing more people to COVID in eight days than were murdered in 1991,"" Bump wrote.

Although he acknowledged ""obvious differences"" between murder and the coronavirus, he only highlighted COVID-19 as a death that’s ""entirely preventable"" by the vaccine.

""There are obvious differences between murder and COVID-19, of course. One is that COVID-19 deaths are almost entirely preventable. While there have been concerted efforts to tamp down on homicides and on deaths from the coronavirus, only the latter can be largely eliminated by a simple vaccine,"" Bump wrote.

Bump’s final paragraphs were dedicated to ridiculing Americans wanting to move forward from COVID, comparing their attitudes to someone who would want to ""move on"" from stopping murders.

""But, again, I demand we go further. No more efforts to catch murderers. No more letting people carry firearms in self-defense. No more restraining orders. No more letting 'experts' on law enforcement tell us what to do. I mean, how many times have the experts on murder made claims that turned out to be wrong? Let’s just ignore them entirely. Maybe we even just go full 'The Purge' and encourage everyone to get their murdering done right off the bat, so we can put it all behind us. I’m just … I’m just ready to move on,"" Bump concluded.

Bump reiterated the sardonic tone when he promoted the article on Twitter.

""Guys, I know that this is contentious, but I am ready to set all of the overwrought precautions aside and just accept that thousands of people are going to die of murder,"" Bump tweeted.

The piece was blasted by critics for its ""disingenuous"" attitude comparing COVID deaths to murder victims.

""Seems like a serious attempt to convince people to get vaccinated should not be based on a non sequitur,"" Pluribus editor Jeryl Bier said.

Washington Examiner reporter Jerry Dunleavy wrote, ""'There are obvious differences between murder & covid-19, of course.' Interestingly the article never notes a key difference— that, while each death is tragic & we should try to avoid unnecessary deaths (for COVID there are vaccines & treatments), murder is a uniquely grave evil.""

In the South, the number of Alabamans hospitalized with COVID-19 has decreased about 5% in the last week.

Statistics from the Alabama Department of Public Health showed 2,805 people were being treated for the illness on Monday; that number is down from 2,961 last Tuesday.

While the hospitals are still struggling to manage patients amidst staff shortages, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 dropped to a still-high 36% after exceeding 40% for nearly four weeks straight.

The entire state remains in the danger zone with high levels of community transmission, yet the improvement has some health officials hopeful.

Alabama has the nation's fourth-highest death rate from COVID-19.

To the north, infections have dropped in Iowa and hospitalizations have fallen about 10% over the course of a week, according to the state's department of public health.

The state's seven-day moving average of daily cases fell to around 4,200 from a recent peak of more than 5,500.

However, the number of nursing homes with outbreaks increased and schools have continued to see a significant number of infections.

More than 680 were in intensive care, which Illinois Department of Public Health data shows is 24.4% fewer than the previous week.

Deaths and the state's seven-day average case positivity rates were also slightly down.

Cases and hospitalizations have fallen in northeastern states like New York and Massachusetts, and the Empire State said in late January that its percent positivity was below 10% for the first time since late December.

2022-02-01 19:05:00+00:00,50,"More than 100 plaintiffs who live and work in the New Orleans area are suing Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the city's health department over its COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates.

The city last month announced that by Feb. 1, all individuals ages 5 and older would have to show proof of at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine or a negative PCR or antigen test to enter certain businesses, though a vaccine mandate went into effect for adults on Jan. 3. Additionally, all individuals 2 years old and older must wear masks indoors.

""The people of New Orleans and our children have endured nearly two years of unprecedented control from our so-called city leaders,"" attorney Laura Cannizzaro Rodrigue, a partner at the New Orleans-based firm Rodriguez & Arcuri, told Fox News Digital of the complaint. ""What started as a temporary means to protect the community from unknown risks of a virus has turned into a circus of mandates that no longer make sense to any rational person. Enough is enough. People all over our great State who live, work, and worship in New Orleans are united in this effort to take back control of their lives and families.""

The complaint filed by Rodrigue & Arcuri and attorney Jimmy Faircloth of Faircloth, Melton, Sobel & Bash LLC, on behalf of more than 100 plaintiffs — and counting — accuses the mayor and the health department, including New Orleans Health Director Jennifer Avengno, of causing ""social, economic and cultural harm"" through ‘authoritarian actions under the pretext of an emergency without end.""

OMICRON VARIANT INCREASES CONCERNS ABOUT LONG COVID

The lawsuit accuses defendants of violating plaintiffs' privacy rights and denying plaintiffs' equal protection under New Orleans law.

The complaint filed in an Orleans Parish Civil District Court includes data showing how the omicron variant of COVID-19 has proven its ability to evade immunity offered by vaccines. While the vaccine prevents severe reactions to the virus — particularly in the elderly and those with underlying conditions — U.S. cases have spiked to record highs in recent weeks as the virus infects both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

""Simply put, the risk posed by Omicron to most people—especially children—is de minimis, far below the risks posed by many other diseases and activities of daily life,"" the lawsuit states. ""For example, the risk to a New Orleans resident or visitor of injury in an automobile or of being the victim of violent crime…is greater than the risk of severe illness from the Omicron variant.""

It also states that ""prior to the rise of the Delta Variant, it was wrongly assumed that the COVID Vaccines would protect against both infection and transmission of the disease, like traditional vaccines such as those developed for small pox, measles, mumps, chicken pox, and rubella.""

The complaint goes on to list a series of mandates and directives imposed by city officials over the last two years related to COVID-19 mitigation efforts, as Fox 8 New Orleans first reported.

The New Orleans Department of Health did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital. The mayor will be holding a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.

In addition, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry is threatening legal action over the city's mandates, which he says are destroying businesses and killing jobs.

The companies began a clinical trial last year to examine the effects of two doses of 3-microgram shots in children younger than 5.

The vaccine is already approved for emergency use in children between the ages of 5 and 11, who receive 10 microgram doses. Children older than 12 and adults receive 30 microgram doses.

Two 3-microgram doses were found to be effective in children between six months and 2 years old, but children between the ages of 2 and 5 did not have the same immune response as the larger two-dose series in older children.

That finding prompted Pfizer to study the administration of a third 3-microgram dose two months after the last dose.

The FDA urged Pfizer and BioNTech to go ahead and submit the two-dose data so the approval process could begin, according to the Washington Post.

Pfizer's vaccine was authorized for children between the ages of 5 and 11 in late October.

About three months later, only 8.7 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 have received at least one dose and 6.2 million are fully vaccinated.

""Being sentenced to probation for taking the doors off of our own building, while criminals are being let go is an absolute joke,"" Atilis Gym co-owner Frank Trumbetti told Fox Business Sunday.

Co-owners Ian Smith and Trumbetti pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal contempt of court, Smith said on Instagram Wednesday. The maximum punishment was a $10,000 fine and 18 months in prison.

""Thanks to all who joined in on our sentencing hearing. So many came that the server crashed,"" Smith announced on Twitter Thursday. ""We got one year probation for the crime of taking our doors off to prevent government goons from locking us out of our gym.""

NEW JERSEY GYM OWNER SAYS GOV. MURPHY ‘ABUSING’ POWER, TRYING TO SEIZE NEARLY $260K WORTH OF HIS ASSETS

Despite the sentence, Smith added that the gym is ""open and will remain open at any cost.""

The charge came after the owners decided to take the doors off of the gym in order to prevent law enforcement from locking them out of the building.

The owners made headlines early in the pandemic when they defied shutdown orders and reopened their business, setting the stage for a legal battle that has spanned nearly two years.

The duo have become the face of the movement to resist lock-downs, going so far as to create a directory of businesses that were also refusing to close their doors.

""We're going to hit that critical point where there's too many businesses open to punish,""Smith said on FOX Business' "" Varney and Co. "" in late 2020. ""And this whole thing will fall apart like a house of cards.""

""Think of it as a Yelp directory for businesses that are defying any and all COVID restrictions ,"" Smith continued. ""Whether that be complete shutdowns, arbitrary time limits on when they can and cannot serve alcohol or when they can't serve food .""

Trumbetti told Fox Business that they intend to continue fighting, saying they ""made a pact that we would fight this tyranny to the end no matter what.""

""Today is day 685 of fourteen days to flatten the curve, we've had over 348,000 visits without a single COVID outbreak linked to our facility,"" Trumbetti said.

The co-owner added that he hopes their story can serve as a ""wake up"" call for the country.

""If I have to go to jail in order to wake up this country as to how corrupt it really is then I guess that I have to risk that, because what I have is worth fighting for,"" Trumbetti said. ""If they are willing to put me in jail for fighting for our rights, it might just be what America needs to see in order to wake up and fight for what is rightfully ours.""

In his Instagram post, Smith signaled optimism that their legal fight will eventually lead to the lockdowns being overturned.

She added, ""If we know what level of immune response we need the vaccine to induce, it will make future vaccine development much quicker and much more efficient.""

The statement said the participants must be between 18-30 years old and in excellent state of health before entering the study, with the study requiring them to have either received a vaccine against COVID-19 without a prior infection or previously had the infection but completely recovered.

The study began in April 2021 with its first phase to establish the lowest dose of the virus, which is the original strain from Wuhan, China, that can infect and replicate in approximately 50% of participants, but cause minimal symptoms, per the statement.

The University of Oxford noted that after a standardized dose is established in the first phase, all participants will be infected with the viral dose in the second phase.

All participants will be quarantined for at least 17 days in a designated hospital suite, get a CT lung and a heart MRI and only be discharged after they are no longer infected or infectious to others, but if any of the participants become symptomatic, they will receive the Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment.

There’s only so much you can do in labs and vials, and sometimes just seeing how something functions within a human body is the best way to learn really quickly,"" said featured study participant Marcus in the study’s video, which includes participants’ interviews on what it’s like to be in the research.

All participants are given informed consent regarding the study and screened before it starts to make sure their risk of getting severe symptoms is really low, according to the video.

Day zero is when the participants get inoculated with COVID-19 in their nose, and then are tested twice a day by PCR to see if they have COVID-19 along with frequent blood tests, per the video.

Although human challenge trials, which deliberately infect people to study the effects of the infection, have been done for years, this is the first known on COVID-19, according to Reuters.

The news outlet also noted, although the trial is completely voluntary, the study’s major drawback is its risk of potential harm to the volunteers who may contract the disease, but the study is taking precautions, including receiving ethics approval.",FoxNews,"['covid19', 'trial', 'worlds', 'challenge', 'study', 'evaluate', 'response', 'vaccine', 'infection', 'risk', 'participants', 'immune', 'university', 'virus', 'sign']",0
2022-01-30 17:20:00+00:00,34,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said this week that third shots of coronavirus vaccines significantly reduced the risk that people who are immunocompromised would be hospitalized due to COVID-19.

In a Thursday study in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency said that – compared to hospitalized adults who had received two mRNA vaccine doses – the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA vaccines against hospitalization for patients with weak immune systems increased to 88%.

CASES OF 'STEALTH' OMICRON SUBVARIANT CONFIRMED IN NORTHEAST STATES: REPORTS

For immunocompromised people who had only had two doses, or a ""primary series,"" the vaccines were 69% effective.

The data was gathered looking at nearly 3,000 – 1,385 case-patients and 1,567 non-COVID-19 controls – at adults admitted to 21 hospitals across 18 states from Aug. 19 through Dec. 15 of last year.

The agency noted the analysis start date was one week after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized an additional dose for emergency use for people aged 12 and older with immunocompromising conditions 28 days following their second dose.

Vaccine effectiveness was calculated for both groups by comparing the odds of previous vaccination between COVID-19 case-patients and control patients who did not have the disease. The regression model was adjusted for admission date, region of hospital, age group, sex and self-reported race and ethnicity. Separate models were generated for immunocompetent adults and adults with immunocompromising conditions and analyses were conducted using Stata software.

Those who had COVID-19-like illness received positive test results by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or antigen test and control patients received negative NAAT tests.

Patients or their proxies were interviewed regarding demographic and clinical characteristics and medical record searches were conducted. Information regarding receipt of prior vaccine doses was obtained through self-report and review of source documentation.

Three vaccination groups were considered including unvaccinated patients, two-dose mRNA recipients and three-dose mRNA recipients.

Three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were roughly 97% effective in preventing hospitalizations in those with stronger immune systems, compared with 82% of those with two doses.

PSAKI: 'FULLY VACCINATED' DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE 'UP-TO-DATE' ON VACCINATIONS

Notably, the study was conducted when the delta variant was predominant in the U.S., whereas omicron now makes up nearly 100% of new cases nationally.

Limitations to these findings include that vaccine recipients in both dose groups were similar in terms of most demographic and clinical characteristics but may have varied with respect to exposure risk for infection, that vaccine effectiveness was not assessed against mild illness or infection, that vaccine effectiveness with a fourth mRNA vaccine dose in immunocompromised individuals was not assessed and that most three-dose mRNA vaccine recipients were vaccinated within several weeks of enrollment and durability of protection will require future analysis.

""Early evidence suggests that a third mRNA vaccine dose elicits markedly stronger neutralizing antibody responses to the omicron variant compared with responses to two vaccine doses, and increases [vaccine effectiveness] against severe disease following infection with the omicron variant,"" the CDC wrote. ""The effectiveness of three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines against a range of disease severity associated with the omicron variant needs to be carefully evaluated in different populations.""

In January, regulators said adults could receive boosters at least five months after their second dose.

As omicron spread, the White House has called on Americans to get their booster and the CDC said that administration of a third COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose as part of a primary series among immunocompromised adults, or as a booster dose among immunocompetent adults, provides improved protection against COVID-19 hospitalization.

Among adults with and without immunocompromising conditions who were eligible to receive a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, third doses were found to increase protection beyond that of a two-dose vaccination series for the prevention of COVID-19 hospitalization.

However, conversations between public officials seem to indicate that some experts may have consciously chosen to suppress evidence that could fuel ""conspiracists.""

""I really can't think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from the bat virus ... to nCoV where you insert exactly four amino acids 12 nucleotide that all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function,"" Dr. Robert Garry from Tulane's School of Medicine said, according to notes from a February 2020 meeting released by House Republicans.

NEW INTEGRAL DOCUMENTS REVEAL COVID ORIGINS DOWNPLAYED

""I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature,"" Garry added in his group comments at the time. ""Don't mention a lab origin, as that will just add fuel to the conspiracists.""

Now, fresh questions are being raised about what American scientists and federal health officials knew about the origins of the coronavirus and whether conflicting evidence was suppressed and hidden from the public.

""NO one said that - I certainly never believed that. At that time of the teleconference we'd been looking all the options - all were on the table including a lab origin. The simple boring fact is we got new data and our opinions changed - that is the lab origin looked progressively less likely,"" Garry told Fox News in an exclusive statement. ""The insinuation that we were somehow bought off with a large NIH grant is absurd - that grant was written and peer-reviewed before anyone had heard of SARS-CoV-2.""

White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci was warned as early as Jan. 27, 2020, that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) he oversaw was indirectly linked to the infamous Wuhan lab through EcoHealth, a U.S.-based scientific nonprofit that had been working with novel coronaviruses.

NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchinloss floated the idea to Fauci that the research partially tied to the U.S. government may not have gone through the appropriate biosafety evaluations, saying that he will ""try to determine if we have any distant ties"" to the facility.

Dr. Kristian Anderson, a prominent virologist at the Scripps lab, told Fauci Jan. 31 2020, that ""the genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,"" an observation that points to synthetic manufacturing.

After Fauci was already made aware of Anderson's observations, a conference call with dozens of expert virologists around the world was organized.

Contacted by Fox News, Anderson denied any influence on his perception of the virus, saying that

""No, I do not believe that origin theories were obscured, censored, or suppressed, although the question has become heavily politicized by lab leak proponents,"" Anderson told Fox. ""Our scientific investigations - published in peer-reviewed scientific journals - have only been driven by scientific enquiry. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.""

Dr. Mike Farzan, another researcher at the Scripps lab, expressed doubts about the virus's origins in nature at the time as well. However, Fauci and others in the meeting pointed to evidence that the virus originated in a seafood and wild animal market in Wuhan.

Investigation into the food hypothesis was complicated by the suspected market being shut down and scrubbed clean by Chinese authorities before a full analysis could be performed.

By the end of the meeting, then-National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins had tentatively sided with the natural causation theory, stating that an emphasis on blame for the outbreak could threaten ""international harmony.""

""I am coming around to the view that a natural origin is more likely,"" Collins wrote at the time. ""But I share your view that a swift convening of experts in a confidence inspiring framework (WHO seems really the only option) is needed, or the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate.""

""Most all of the lab leak scenarios involve a conspiracy and a cover-up by scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If you believe in the only - highly unlikely - lab leak scenario that's not a conspiracy - an accidental release of a virus that WIV didn't know they had - then you still have to explain how most of the early cases ended up linked to markets selling wild animals,"" Garry told Fox News.

Just four days later, five researchers who were on the call authored preliminary findings abandoning their early private beliefs that the virus was likely the result of a lab leak. The March 17, 2020, article published in Nature Medicine stated, ""Our analysis clearly shows that [COVID] is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.""

The concerns and questionable evidence originally debated by experts just months earlier were not just dismissed but went completely unacknowledged in the article's analysis. It is unclear what new evidence prompted the reversal of opinion, but private communications show that various drafts were sent to Fauci and Collins for approval.

Individuals within the federal government continued to consciously suppress accusations of human involvement with the COVID-19 outbreak despite the standing evidence against such a theory.

FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN

After then-President Trump said he would not discount the theory that the virus spread from a Chinese wet market due to unsafe hygiene practices, Collins wrote to Fauci, ""Wondering is there something NIH can do to put down this very destructive conspiracy.""

""I would not do anything about this right now. It is a shiny object that will go away in time,"" Fauci assured Collins.

At an April 17 press conference, Fauci assured the public that the makeup of COVID-19 was in line with what could be expected from a natural virus.

All the way up until his last days in office, Collins continued to focus on natural explanations of the pandemic.

In an interview near the end of his time at the head of the NIH, Collins did not outright deny any possibility of human influence on the virus, but he stopped short of entertaining the idea COVID-19 was made from the ground up.

""I don't think I have any more new information to be able to tip the balance,"" he said. ""Certainly possible that this was somehow under study in the lab even though it was not human engineered from scratch, I am quite confident of that.""

Collins stood by the natural cause hypothesis through the rest of his time in his position.

On the guidance of world virology experts, Facebook actively suppressed reporting on the lab leak theory, utilizing ""false information"" warnings and listing relevant investigations as ""debunked"" until May 2021.

NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchinloss floated the idea to Fauci that the research partially tied to the U.S. government may not have gone through the appropriate biosafety evaluations, saying that he will ""try to determine if we have any distant ties"" to the facility.

Dr. Kristian Anderson, a prominent virologist at the Scripps lab, told Fauci Jan. 31 2020, that ""the genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,"" an observation that points to synthetic manufacturing.

After Fauci was already made aware of Anderson's observations, a conference call with dozens of expert virologists around the world was organized.

Contacted by Fox News, Anderson denied any influence on his perception of the virus, saying that

""No, I do not believe that origin theories were obscured, censored, or suppressed, although the question has become heavily politicized by lab leak proponents,"" Anderson told Fox. ""Our scientific investigations - published in peer-reviewed scientific journals - have only been driven by scientific enquiry. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.""

Dr. Mike Farzan, another researcher at the Scripps lab, expressed doubts about the virus's origins in nature at the time as well. However, Fauci and others in the meeting pointed to evidence that the virus originated in a seafood and wild animal market in Wuhan.

Investigation into the food hypothesis was complicated by the suspected market being shut down and scrubbed clean by Chinese authorities before a full analysis could be performed.

By the end of the meeting, then-National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins had tentatively sided with the natural causation theory, stating that an emphasis on blame for the outbreak could threaten ""international harmony.""

""I am coming around to the view that a natural origin is more likely,"" Collins wrote at the time. ""But I share your view that a swift convening of experts in a confidence inspiring framework (WHO seems really the only option) is needed, or the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate.""

""Most all of the lab leak scenarios involve a conspiracy and a cover-up by scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If you believe in the only - highly unlikely - lab leak scenario that's not a conspiracy - an accidental release of a virus that WIV didn't know they had - then you still have to explain how most of the early cases ended up linked to markets selling wild animals,"" Garry told Fox News.

Just four days later, five researchers who were on the call authored preliminary findings abandoning their early private beliefs that the virus was likely the result of a lab leak. The March 17, 2020, article published in Nature Medicine stated, ""Our analysis clearly shows that [COVID] is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.""

The concerns and questionable evidence originally debated by experts just months earlier were not just dismissed but went completely unacknowledged in the article's analysis. It is unclear what new evidence prompted the reversal of opinion, but private communications show that various drafts were sent to Fauci and Collins for approval.

Individuals within the federal government continued to consciously suppress accusations of human involvement with the COVID-19 outbreak despite the standing evidence against such a theory.

FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT OUTLINES FRESH QUESTIONS ON WHAT FAUCI, GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT COVID ORIGIN

After then-President Trump said he would not discount the theory that the virus spread from a Chinese wet market due to unsafe hygiene practices, Collins wrote to Fauci, ""Wondering is there something NIH can do to put down this very destructive conspiracy.""

""I would not do anything about this right now. It is a shiny object that will go away in time,"" Fauci assured Collins.

At an April 17 press conference, Fauci assured the public that the makeup of COVID-19 was in line with what could be expected from a natural virus.

All the way up until his last days in office, Collins continued to focus on natural explanations of the pandemic.

In an interview near the end of his time at the head of the NIH, Collins did not outright deny any possibility of human influence on the virus, but he stopped short of entertaining the idea COVID-19 was made from the ground up.

""I don't think I have any more new information to be able to tip the balance,"" he said. ""Certainly possible that this was somehow under study in the lab even though it was not human engineered from scratch, I am quite confident of that.""

Collins stood by the natural cause hypothesis through the rest of his time in his position.

On the guidance of world virology experts, Facebook actively suppressed reporting on the lab leak theory, utilizing ""false information"" warnings and listing relevant investigations as ""debunked"" until May 2021.

However, conversations between public officials seem to indicate that some experts may have consciously chosen to suppress evidence that could fuel ""conspiracists.""

""I really can't think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from the bat virus ... to nCoV where you insert exactly four amino acids 12 nucleotide that all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function,"" Dr. Robert Garry from Tulane's School of Medicine said, according to notes from a February 2020 meeting released by House Republicans.

""I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature,"" Garry added in his group comments at the time. ""Don't mention a lab origin, as that will just add fuel to the conspiracists.""

Now, fresh questions are being raised about what American scientists and federal health officials knew about the origins of the coronavirus and whether conflicting evidence was suppressed and hidden from the public.

""NO one said that - I certainly never believed that. At that time of the teleconference we'd been looking all the options - all were on the table including a lab origin.

2022-01-28 02:50:00+00:00,61,"Goldie Hawn emphasized the effect the COVID-19 pandemic is having on America's children in an op-ed published Wednesday.

Hawn likened the ""existential dread"" felt by children amid the coronavirus pandemic to the ""dread"" felt by children following the Cold War, the Challenger crash and 9/11 in an op-ed for USA Today.

""Today, we are in the midst of a national trauma that could very well surpass 9/11 and approach the heightened terror of the Cold War years,"" Hawn wrote. ""The COVID era has changed our children’s lives in far more real, tangible ways — social distancing, school closures, daily mask use.""

The ""Overboard"" actress went on to say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with the U.S. surgeon general and the American Academy of Pediatrics all agree that ""the state of our children's mental health is now at the level of a national emergency.""

BOB SAGET SPOKE ABOUT COVID BOUT BEFORE DEATH: ‘IT DOES NOT FEEL GOOD’

""This tells us that as a nation, we have failed our children,"" she continued. ""The few federal and state dollars that get directed to youth ‘mental health’ invariably end up being earmarked for addiction and ‘crisis care,’ addressing only the most severe disorders. There are modest funds once a kid ends up in a hospital. But what about before?""

""We are not properly funding preventive care and early interventions that normalize the mental struggles every individual has at some level,"" Hawn added. ""There are everyday tools for mental fitness, just as there are for exercise and healthy eating; we just don’t teach them in any systematic way to our nation’s children.""

Hawn wrote about her own personal ""two-decade journey"" working with educators and scientists to develop a curriculum for children that would help them ""understand the complex chemical reactions that drive emotions"" and ""regulate"" them when necessary.

Hawn has been an advocate for children's mental health since founding the non-profit MindUp in 2003. The organization was started to ""help children develop the knowledge and tools they need to manage stress, regulate emotions and face the challenges of the 21st century with optimism, resilience and compassion."" MindUp directly deals with childhood aggression, anxiety, depression and suicide.

Hawn noted in the op-ed the rising suspected suicide attempt rates in the United States.

""Kids are afraid of people, spaces, even the air around them — a level of constant fear not seen in decades. In early 2021, emergency room visits in the United States for suspected suicide attempts were 51% higher for adolescent girls and 4% higher for adolescent boys, compared with the same time period in early 2019,"" she wrote.

Hawn ended her writing by stating that we will ""survive"" the COVID-19 pandemic but noted that she's ""not sure we can survive an entire generation whose collective trauma sends them hobbling into adulthood.""

2022-01-27 22:25:00+00:00,19,"The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the best way to prevent infection and slow the spread of COVID-19 is to get vaccinated , but the total number of breakthrough cases is unknown because the agency only monitors the most severe on a monthly basis, according to Medpage Today .

After May 1, 2021, the CDC streamlined from reporting all breakthrough COVID-19 infections to only monitoring the most severe cases, with the agency acknowledging the total number of cases are under underrepresented because of the asymptomatic patients or mild cases who do not seek care or testing .

Dr. Devang Sanghavi, medical director of the medical intensivist unit at Mayo Clinic, told the American Medical Association (AMA) that a breakthrough COVID-19 infection is defined as the detection of COVID-19 viral RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen collected 14 days after receiving the second dose of Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccines or two weeks after the first dose of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine .

The CDC transitioned to focus on the breakthrough cases of the highest clinical and public health significance ""because many breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people will not develop into serious illness compared to those who are unvaccinated and get COVID-19,"" the agency noted .

""One of the strengths of this system is collecting data on severe cases of vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 since it is likely that most of these types of vaccine breakthrough cases seek medical care and are diagnosed and reported as a COVID-19 case,"" the agency said .

Approximately 10% of people who develop breakthrough infections, however, still require hospitalization, Sanghavi told the AMA. ""One percent to 2% of those hospitalized from breakthrough infections may still die, unfortunately. So, it’s still a concern,"" he added .

LONG COVID: 4 BIOLOGICAL RISK FACTORS COUL INCREASE CHANCES, ACCORDING TO STUDY

A CDC spokesperson told Fox News the agency monitors rates of COVID-19 breakthrough cases and their associated hospitalization and deaths on a monthly basis, not continuously, because, ""These data are reported based on when the patient was tested, not the date they died.""

""Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after diagnosis. This is why CDC allows at least 4 weeks of lag time to link case surveillance data to Immunization Information System (IIS) and vital records data up to a month after the diagnosis.""

Dr. Eric Topol, professor and executive vice-president of Scripps Research and founder and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute, however, told Fox News, ""The CDC vaccination breakthrough data reporting has been grossly inadequate.""

When the pandemic first started, the level of protection from the vaccines could be interpreted by monitoring breakthrough infections between the unvaccinated with those who were vaccinated, ""… but now it is more a comparison of vaccinated versus previously infected [with COVID-19],"" said David Dowdy, MD, PhD, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

Dowdy told Fox News, ""Now that the vast majority of the unvaccinated population has been infected, measurement of ‘breakthrough’ infections is more difficult to interpret.""

CDC'S WALENSKY FAILS TO DISCLOSE HOW MANY DEATHS WERE ‘FROM’ COVID-19

COVID-19 infections among vaccinated people were not common with the delta variant, but because the omicron variant is more transmissible, ""It is not uncommon to see breakthrough infections,"" added Sanghavi , who also noted breakthrough infections occur among vaccinated people because their immunity wanes over time .

He said because the vaccines were created for a different strain than the omicron variant, ""… the efficacy of the vaccine itself may not be as good for omicron as compared to say delta as compared to alpha [variant], which was what it was originally designed for .""

Saad Omer, MPH, PhD, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told NPR last year that tracking non-severe breakthrough infections is also important.

""In this pandemic, unfortunately, we have been chasing the outbreak. And the way to control an outbreak is to get ahead of it. And one way to get ahead of it is to detect these early signals and making sure that you are testing not just severe cases that take time to sort of get to the hospital ,"" he said.

2022-01-27 21:15:00+00:00,16,"Education Secretary Miguel Cardona laid out his vision for reopening America's schools on Thursday, emphasizing the need to make education an ""equalizer"" and address inequities in school systems.

Keeping schools open after the coronavirus pandemic was ""insufficient,"" Cardona remarked during his speech at the Lyndon B. Johnson building for the Department of Education.

""Our hardest and most important work lies ahead. It'll be what we're judged against,"" he said. ""And I want to be very, very clear: as educators and leaders, we're either closing educational opportunity gaps or making them worse with the decisions we're going to make in the next coming months and years.""

Cardona's speech came as he faces allegations that his department went too far in the push for ""equity"" and not far enough in helping students during the pandemic.

EDUCATION SECRETARY CARDONA SHOULD RESIGN, OVER 100 CONSERVATIVES SAY IN NEW LETTER

Within the last month, a national parents' group sent Cardona a letter outlining a variety of recommendations it wanted him to make for states in reopening. Shortly before that, Fox News Digital reported on an email indicating that Cardona solicited the controversial National School Boards Association (NSBA) letter that suggested parents might be engaging in domestic terrorism.

The department has denied Cardona solicited the letter, which poured fuel onto an already raging debate over critical race theory, ""equity"" and so-called ""anti-racism"" within schools. In a letter this week, more than 100 conservative leaders requested his resignation.

On Thursday, Cardona called on the U.S. to not miss the opportunity to ""re-imagine education."" He added that the country should ""unapologetically address opportunity and achievement gaps that are pervasive in our country.""

""This means acknowledging that many of the students who have been underserved during the pandemic are the same ones who have had to deal with barriers to a high-quality education since well before COVID-19,"" he said.

NATIONAL PARENTS GROUP SENDS CARDONA LIST OF COVID-RELATED DEMANDS, ASKS FOR TRANSPARENCY ON FEDERAL SPENDING

""We can't lose this moment – this chance for a reset in education – by going back to the same pre-pandemic strategies that didn't address inequities for Latino, for Black, for Native students; for students from low-income backgrounds, or students from rural communities; for students with disabilities; students experiencing homelessness, or for English learners.""

""Instead, let's do what America does best. Let's turn crisis into opportunity.""

Among his many proposals was one to increase Title I funding, which provides federal money for low-income schools. He also voiced support for universal preschool, increasing mental health resources, raising reading levels, ""honoring native languages and cultures,"" and creating ""more meaningful and authentic parent and family engagement.""

Cardona devoted part of his speech to honoring teachers, whom he said ""worked courageously to"" reopen schools. ""Let's not just talk about honoring educators, let's make sure they're treated with the respect and the dignity they deserve,"" he said.

""This means a livable wage, it means ongoing professional learning and development, supportive working conditions and a work environment where their voices are welcome as critical partners in our work to improve education. Moving forward, it's on us to make sure education jobs are ones educators don't want to leave and that people from all backgrounds want to pursue.""",FoxNews,"['covid19', 'students', 'speech', 'miguel', 'parents', 'work', 'education', 'reimagine', 'cardona', 'calls', 'opportunity', 'schools', 'reset', 'letter', 'secretary', 'lets']",0

In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Reps. James Comer, R-Ky., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed to a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call that included Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins in which the virus's origins were discussed.

TUNE IN: 'SPECIAL REPORT' DIVES INTO NEWLY REVEALED EMAILS OVER COVID-19 ORIGIN, TUESDAY AT 6PM ET ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL

""It was on this conference call that Drs. Fauci and Collins were first warned that COVID-19 may have leaked from the WIV and, further, may have been intentionally genetically manipulated,"" the Republicans' letter said.

The congressmen said that ""it is unclear if either Dr. Fauci or Dr. Collins ever passed these warnings along to other government officials or if they simply ignored them.""

The letter said other scientists participated in the call, four of whom wrote a paper titled, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2"" that they sent to Fauci and Collins three days after the call. The article did not argue that the virus originated in the lab.

The Republicans are now questioning whether the lab leak theory was dropped due to influence from Fauci and/or Collins.

FAUCI: REPORTS OF MILDER COVID VARIANT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AS SIGNAL US CAN LESSEN RESTRICTIONS

""It is unclear what, if any, new evidence was presented or if the underlying science changed in that short period of time, but after speaking with Drs. Fauci and Collins, the authors abandoned their belief COVID-19 was the result of a laboratory leak,"" Comer and Jordan said, adding that they do not know whether Fauci or Collins edited the paper before it was published in Nature Medicine.

According to Comer and Jordan, the emails contain notes from the Feb. 1, 2020, conference call. One, from Dr. Jeremy Farrar to Collins, Fauci and current NIH Acting Director Lawrence Tabak, stated that ""a likely explanation"" could involve ""accidently creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission between humans[.]""

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS CDC LED BY SCIENCE AMID SHIFTING COVID-19 GUIDANCE

Discussing the similarities to a bat coronavirus and the very specific differences, Farrar said he ""just can’t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature.""

In response, however, Collins wrote that he was ""coming around to the view that a natural origin is more likely.""

By April, Collins, Fauci, Tabak and others were emailing about a ""very destructive conspiracy,"" linking to an article about the lab leak theory.

""I hoped the Nature Medicine article on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 would settle this. But probably didn't get much visibility,"" Collins said.

""I would not do anything about this right now. It is a shiny object that will go away in time,"" Fauci wrote back.

The same day Fauci wrote that email, Comer and Jordan's letter said, Fauci mentioned the Nature Medicine article while speaking at the White House, ""likely in an effort to further stifle the hypothesis COVID-19 leaked from the WIV.""

Comer and Jordan are now asking HHS for information regarding whether Fauci and Collins warned anyone at the White House about the lab leak theory, whether there was new evidence between Feb. 1 and Feb. 4, 2020, that convinced them it was not a leak, and whether they edited the content of the Nature Medicine article.

The congressmen are also calling for Fauci to appear for a transcribed interview where they can discuss this matter.

Last June, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request for ""records about U.S. diplomatic personnel in or seeking to enter China being subjected to anal swab tests for the COVID-19 virus, including all complaints and communications regarding such testing."" That request went unanswered and led to the filing of a lawsuit from Judicial Watch.

While certain information is redacted, emails between officials confirm U.S. employees were anally swabbed for the coronavirus.

A general services officer from the U.S. Consulate General in Shenyang — whose name has been redacted — sent an email on Jan. 22, 2021, with the subject: ""New Testing Method?""

""So, a colleague from [redacted] telling our group [redacted] that he was given an anal COVID swab at his apartment,"" the email stated. ""Just a heads up, as I am sure it is going to blow up soon… if you aren’t already dealing with it. Employee’s name is [redacted]. Just getting ahead before the word of mouth starts spreading.""

A redacted official then responded, ""In what city did this occur? And what number test? And did he say if they gave any notice beforehand the test would be conducted in this manner? And was he presented with options.""

A redacted official replied, informing the other official that the incident occurred in Beijing in the American's apartment.

""No notice or options as I can tell,"" the official wrote in the email. ""He had to both a nose and anal swab"".

Judicial Watch also reported that on Jan. 22, 2021, a management officer in the U.S. Consulate in Shenyang, whose name is redacted, sent an email with the subject ""RE: No Anal swabs for diplomats.""

""FAO [foreign area office] is telling the Embassy that it was a mistake to ask for anal swabs and that it didn’t apply to diplomats.

Fauci said it ""makes sense to think in terms of at least having ready an omicron specific boost.""

""We may not need it ... but I think it’s prudent to at least prepare for the possibility that this may be a persistent variant that we may have to face – even if it’s at a very low level,"" Fauci told MSNBC.

FAUCI OUTLINES PANDEMIC LONG-TERM RETURN TO NORMAL: 'BEST-CASE SCENARIO' WE LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT

While scientists have projected that new variants of concern would emerge in coming weeks, the nation's top infectious disease expert also said that after a while there will be enough ""background immunity"" such that even if new variants emerge ""they don't take that surge effect that we've seen with the four, now five surges that we've seen since early 2020.""

The more people who are vaccinated and are boosted, the ""less the likelihood … [of] variants that keep challenging us,"" he noted.

When it comes to the complete eradication of COVID-19, Fauci said he ""[doesn't] think there's a chance"" we will do so.

""We've only done that with one virus and that's been smallpox,"" he noted.

Fauci said if the U.S. can whittle down coronavirus to a level ""where it doesn't really challenge us and threaten us from a public health standpoint, that would be an acceptable, quote ‘living with the virus.’""

On CNN Monday night, Fauci said the omicron surge is beginning to go in the ""right direction,"" though noting that there's still a considerable amount of activity in the southern and western U.S.

""We project that in the next week or two – or more – we're going to start seeing the same peak and coming down,"" he explained, with a timeframe for livable conditions amid COVID remaining ""very difficult to predict.""

According to Fauci, the ""best-case scenario"" is that, with the tools at the nation's disposal, the spread can be kept down – with hospitalizations down to ""around the level of other respiratory diseases that we've been accepting year after year as not disruptive of our society.""

The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center shows the U.S. saw more than a million cases and nearly 2,000 new deaths in the past day.

In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Reps. James Comer, R-Ky., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed to a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call that included Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins in which the virus's origins were discussed.

TUNE IN: 'SPECIAL REPORT' DIVES INTO NEWLY REVEALED EMAILS OVER COVID-19 ORIGIN, TUESDAY AT 6PM ET ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL

""It was on this conference call that Drs. Fauci and Collins were first warned that COVID-19 may have leaked from the WIV and, further, may have been intentionally genetically manipulated,"" the Republicans' letter said.

The congressmen said that ""it is unclear if either Dr. Fauci or Dr. Collins ever passed these warnings along to other government officials or if they simply ignored them.""

The letter said other scientists participated in the call, four of whom wrote a paper titled, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2"" that they sent to Fauci and Collins three days after the call. The article did not argue that the virus originated in the lab.

The Republicans are now questioning whether the lab leak theory was dropped due to influence from Fauci and/or Collins.

FAUCI: REPORTS OF MILDER COVID VARIANT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AS SIGNAL US CAN LESSEN RESTRICTIONS

""It is unclear what, if any, new evidence was presented or if the underlying science changed in that short period of time, but after speaking with Drs. Fauci and Collins, the authors abandoned their belief COVID-19 was the result of a laboratory leak,"" Comer and Jordan said, adding that they do not know whether Fauci or Collins edited the paper before it was published in Nature Medicine.

According to Comer and Jordan, the emails contain notes from the Feb. 1, 2020, conference call. One, from Dr. Jeremy Farrar to Collins, Fauci and current NIH Acting Director Lawrence Tabak, stated that ""a likely explanation"" could involve ""accidently creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission between humans[.]""

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS CDC LED BY SCIENCE AMID SHIFTING COVID-19 GUIDANCE

Discussing the similarities to a bat coronavirus and the very specific differences, Farrar said he ""just can’t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature.""

In response, however, Collins wrote that he was ""coming around to the view that a natural origin is more likely.""

By April, Collins, Fauci, Tabak and others were emailing about a ""very destructive conspiracy,"" linking to an article about the lab leak theory.

""I hoped the Nature Medicine article on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 would settle this. But probably didn't get much visibility,"" Collins said.

""I would not do anything about this right now. It is a shiny object that will go away in time,"" Fauci wrote back.

The same day Fauci wrote that email, Comer and Jordan's letter said, Fauci mentioned the Nature Medicine article while speaking at the White House, ""likely in an effort to further stifle the hypothesis COVID-19 leaked from the WIV.""

Comer and Jordan are now asking HHS for information regarding whether Fauci and Collins warned anyone at the White House about the lab leak theory, whether there was new evidence between Feb. 1 and Feb. 4, 2020, that convinced them it was not a leak, and whether they edited the content of the Nature Medicine article.

But he noted when he turned the test package over the ""fine print"" revealed the tests were manufactured in China.

The free at-home tests were part of the White House's newly launched initiative to work with the U.S. Postal Service to mail out 500 million at-home coronavirus tests to Americans in the coming weeks to address a testing kit shortage amid the recent omicron surge.

Hemmer received the 15-minute at-home rapid antigen tests from iHealth Labs Inc. The company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, but the test is ""Made in China,"" according to the label.

iHealth is a unit of the Chinese company Andon Health Co. Ltd., according to Reuters. It was awarded a $1.275 billion contract for COVID-19 rapid tests with the U.S. government on Jan. 13, according to the Defense.gov website.

The Biden administration said Tuesday not all the 500 million tests were made in China, but there are not enough American-made tests to meet the demand, so they sourced kits made ""in other parts of the world.""

""We are procuring as many US-made at-home tests as are available to purchase, while also purchasing additional, FDA authorized at-home tests that are made in other parts of the world,"" an administration official told Fox News Digital in a statement Tuesday. ""Together this ensures that we are making available as many at-home tests for the American people as possible and importantly, we’re doing so in a way that ensures we are not interfering with other channels where people can get at home tests, including through their states, pharmacies and online retailers.""

The official added that all tests – regardless of origin – were subjected to the emergency use authorization process through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Right out of the gate, the track is overtly political as the typically right-leaning rocker bashes COVID-19 mandates and even outright calls out Fauci by name.

The chorus of the more than four-minute song is simply a chant of the phrase ""Let’s go Brandon"" a not-so-secret code that has come to stand in for ""F---Joe Biden"" among his critics on the right.

The Twitter account, ""CPS COVID-19 Dashboard,"" is run by Jakob Ondrey, a Chicago resident whose goal is to visualize the coronavirus cases reported by the CPS. This week, he noticed that there was a discrepancy in the data that began in the midst of the nationwide surge in omicron variant cases, which led Hopkins to step in.

Closed cases as defined by the district only contain coronavirus cases that are ""reviewed, verified, and investigated by the Contact Tracing Team.""

The spokesperson said that the CPS changed their method in which cases were tracked on Dec. 20, 2021, in order to protect the privacy of students and staff to only track closed cases on the school level.

""CPS was reporting all school-level open cases on our COVID-19 data website pages until Winter Break.

""CPS remains committed to transparency and accurate data to drive our decision making. We also understand that the data shows a large gap between open reported cases and closed reported cases over the last two weeks. This is due to two main factors: a large number of open reported cases coming out of Winter Break, and the fact that with staff and students out of buildings from Jan. 5 - Jan. 12 due to the work stoppage, many cases were rendered inactionable for contact tracing purposes, and contact tracing became even more difficult once the work stoppage concluded and students and staff returned to class,"" the spokesperson said.",FoxNews,"['discrepancy', 'covid19', 'data', 'explain', 'dashboard', 'closed', 'district', 'students', 'demands', 'chicago', 'alderman', 'spokesperson', 'cps', 'cases', 'coronavirus', 'reported']",0

""How we get from infection to smell loss remains unclear,"" said Dr. Justin Turner, an associate professor of otolaryngology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., who was not part of the study.

Researchers from 23andMe, a genomics and biotechnology company, analyzed data from 69,841 individuals in the United States and United Kingdom who took online surveys after having a positive COVID-19 test, comparing those who reported a loss of taste or smell with those who did not.

Among those who tested positive for COVID-19, 68% participants reported a loss of taste or smell, the female respondents were 11% more likely than men to report the symptoms and approximately 73% were ages 26-35, per the study.

COVID-19: RUSSIA HITS ALL-TIME HIGH INFECTIONS, BLAMES OMICRON VARIANT

The study also found the loss of taste or smell was more common among those with a COVID-19 test compared to those who tested negative but reported cold-flu like symptoms, noting those of East Asian or African American ancestry were significantly less likely to report the loss of smell or taste compared to individuals of European ancestry.

The research team compared the genetic differences of those who reported a loss of taste or smell with those who didn’t, finding a location near two genes, UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, to be related to the sense of smell that is associated with the loss of taste and smell after being infected with COVID-19.

Even though past animal studies showed these genes, which are expressed in the tissue in our nose, are involved in the elimination of ‘odorants’ and previous experimental studies suggest the loss of smell is related to tissue damage along the lining of the nose, the authors concede it’s unclear how the genes are actually involved, only that they "" … may play a role in the physiology of infected cells and the resulting functional impairment that contributes to loss of ability to smell.""

Despite the research being a large scale study, it did have several limitations, including a bias toward European ancestry participants, relying only on self-report surveys without any clinical evaluations of the participants, and the inability to ""disentangle"" the loss of taste with smell because both were included in a single survey question.

""Notably, the [gene] variant identified in this study also appears to be associated with general ability to smell, which may suggest that those with heightened smell or taste sensitivity may be more prone to notice a loss of these senses resulting from a SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" the authors said.

2022-01-21 23:45:00+00:00,30,"Speaking at the White House COVID-19 response team briefing Friday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said three new reports released by the agency add evidence to the importance of being ""up to date"" with vaccinations against COVID-19.

They are the first large U.S. studies to look at vaccine protection against omicron and echo previous research indicating vaccines are less effective against the variant than earlier versions of the coronavirus.

But, they also show that boosters significantly improve protection.

BIDEN ADMIN AWARDS $103M FROM AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO FIGHT HEALTH CARE WORKER BURNOUT

""The data here show … the protection provided by vaccines and the importance of being up to date on your COVID-19 vaccination,"" Walensky told reporters.

The first study looked at hospitalizations and emergency room and urgent care center visits in 10 states, from August through January.

The researchers found vaccine effectiveness was best after three doses of the mRNA Pfizer or Moderna vaccines in preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care visits.

Protection dropped from 94% during the delta wave over the summer to 82% during the omicron wave and protection from just two doses was lower – especially if half a year had passed following the second dose.

The second study examined case and death rates in 25 states from April through Christmas.

During both the delta and omicron waves, people who were boosted had the highest protection against infection.

COVID-19: NEARLY HALF OF VIRUS HOSPITALIZATIONS IN MASSACHUSETTS ARE FOR OTHER ISSUES

A third study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), also led by CDC researchers, observed people who tested positive from Dec. 10 to Jan. 1 at more than 4,600 testing sites.

While three shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were about 67% effective against omicron-related symptomatic disease compared with unvaccinated people, two doses offered no significant protection against the variant.

""Taken together, these data highlight two important points. First, those who remain unvaccinated are at a significantly higher risk for infection and severe COVID-19 disease,"" Walensky explained. ""Second, protection against infection and hospitalization with the omicron variant is highest for those who are up to date with their vaccination, meaning those who are boosted when they're eligible.""

""There are still millions of people who are eligible for a booster dose and have not yet received one,"" she added. ""As we continue to face the omicron variant – representing over 99% of infections in the United States today – I urge all who are eligible to get their booster shot, to get it as soon as possible.""

White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said that 210 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including nearly 75% of adults.

He said those individuals are 16 times less likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 than those who remain unvaccinated.

""We're not there yet, but the president's COVID plan is clearly working. And, we're confident we'll continue to make progress to get to where we all want to be,"" Zients concluded.

Boston 25, citing the newly released data, reported that 49% of the state’s 3,187 patients-- hospitalized on Jan. 18--were there because of another matter and diagnosed with the virus once at the hospital.

Medical officials in the state made clear that they have no intention of diminishing the ""incidental"" cases-- pointing out that they will still require special care--but they hope the numbers will better reflect the virus' impact on the community

Dr. Shira Doron, a Tufts Medical Center’s epidemiologist, worked on the state’s new reporting system and told the station that the data indicate that the vaccines are doing their job.

""At Tufts Medical Center, half of them are vaccinated, and you don’t want to be calling them a vaccine breakthrough hospitalization when they aren’t,"" she said.

The Boston 25 report said hospitals in the state measure primary COVID cases as those that require dexamethasone, the steroid treatment, which the majority of patients with severe coronavirus require.

Since the start of the outbreak, health officials have been accused of causing confusion by not distinguishing hospital cases. Since the start of the pandemic, the elderly and those with co-morbidities have been known to be at the greatest risk of serious illness. Some critics say politics were at play.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently spoke out against Dr. Anthony Fauci for only now editing his message when it comes to hospitalizations.

Cruz retweeted an interview Fauci had on MSNBC where he spoke about the troubling numbers of children in the hospital with the virus late last month. Fauci made it clear that there is a distinction between the number of children hospitalized with COVID as opposed to ""because of COVID.""

""And what we mean by that: If a child goes into the hospital, they automatically get tested for COVID and they get counted as a COVID-hospitalized individual, when, in fact, they may go in for a broken leg or appendicitis or something like that. So it’s over counting the number of children who are, quote, hospitalized with COVID as opposed to because of COVID,"" Fauci said.

""Huntah"" and ""Duke,"" 14-month-old Labrador Retrievers, work weekly across 15 school facilities in Bristol County, Massachusetts, searching and sniffing for the odor that COVID-19 leaves behind.

Bristol County’s Sheriff’s Office is the first in the nation to deploy the COVID-sniffing K-9s in the region.

""It's giving the community a feeling of a little more security and know that at least if my child is going to school or my husband's working in an area, they’re not going to bring home COVID because law enforcement is proactively looking to sanitize where those things might pop up,"" Thomas M. Hodgson, Sheriff of Bristol County, Massachusetts, tells Fox News.

FLORIDA K-9S HONORED WITH PURPLE HEARTS AFTER BEING SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY

Dr. Kenneth Furton, founder of the COVID K-9 detection program at Florida International University (FIU) in Miami, spent much of his life researching canine olfaction. He left no time to waste when the pandemic hit in March 2020, measuring a dogs’ reliability to detect COVID with a pure chemical called a universal detection calibrator (UTC).

""So we found on average that the dogs are 97.5% accurate, which is actually higher than PCR tests,"" says Dr. Furton, who is also the provost at FIU. He believes the COVID K-9 dogs has the potential to expand into other industries that expect large gatherings.

""If you were to have dogs screening people going onto a cruise ship, you would detect whether they have COVID right then, not doing a test days before."" He said. ""So here you have a great advantage in that regard.""

FLORIDA SHERIFF'S OFFICE NAMES K-9 AFTER SERGEANT KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY

BarkBox, a pet care company located in Chinatown, New York, gave the FIU program a test run back one week in October 2021 when they were transitioning their employees back to its office, but this time with Beagles.

""All the employees had to come through one entrance, and they got sniffed by the dogs. It was much more comforting to have extra reaffirmation and the atmosphere was more relaxed those days that the dogs were there,"" said Stacie Grissom, Director of Content and Communications at BarkBox.

Tara Kohler, the superintendent of Fairhaven School District in Mass., describes the K-9 detection program which was implemented in three of her schools in December 2021 as ""a real game-changer"" that helps keep the spread of COVID under control.

""It's about not taking down a workforce, not taking down entire classrooms. We have kids to teach, and we have teachers who want to do their job,"" Kohler said to Fox News. ""So to be able to have this additional tool in our toolbox to bring a dog through and to make sure we're doing everything we can, it's just a win-win.""

From the library to classrooms, the four-legged duo and their handlers are put to work to ensure no trace of COVID-19 is left uncharted in schools across Bristol County. If a canine makes a ""hit,"" they will sit next to the infected area, even tapping its nose or paw on the spot.

""We're doing six, seven, eight hits a day,"" Paul Douglas handler for Huntah and Captain of Bristol County’s Sheriff’s Office K-9 Unit. ""Working with these COVID dogs has just been a real highlight of my career.""

""I have two kids. So, I think of them when I go into a school and that we're coming in and making a difference,"" said Capt. Douglas, who has been working with canines for the past seventeen years. ""It's for the children to help stop the spread and see their faces and see the staff, you know how happy they are.

At East Fairhaven Elementary School, Fox News witnessed K-9 Duke detect COVID in 8 areas within the cafeteria, allowing school staffers to decontaminate infected areas such as tables and chairs before lunchtime.

""I think we're in a world where kids are afraid, so if you’re a youngster, you've only known school to be masked and scary. So to us, having them see we're doing everything we can to keep them safe, I always think is the best thing you can do,"" added Kohler.

Parents will be notified by the elementary school if their child was found to be in an area where a K-9 detected COVID. The school also offers a free rapid test onsite.

""If a canine indicates on, let’s say, a locker in a hallway, we will notify the family that there's been a hit, and to just a monitor for symptoms."" Says Kohler.

""We just suggest you monitor for symptoms. And do you want a COVID test? And if so, we provide a test free of charge. If they don't take the test, they are still allowed to come back to school the next day. It's just a proactive step.""

Parents like Heather Lopes are on board with having COVID working dogs at East Fairhaven Elementary School where her son attends school.

""I think it's pretty neat if they can sniff something that could possibly be putting our kids in harm's way or make them ill,"" Lopes said to Fox News. ""I want them to be safe, just like any other parent wants them to be safe.""

Lopes’ son, a 4th grader at East Fairhaven Elementary, is glad to have Huntah and Duke patrolling the hallways at his school.

BIDEN COVID-19 PROMISES ON ELIMINATING VIRUS, FIXING TESTING FALL FLAT DURING FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE

In recent months, the Biden administration has faced criticism over how it has handled the need for coronavirus tests nationwide. A Dec. 23 report from Vanity Fair — which Biden has denied — claimed the administration rejected a plan to boost COVID testing in October.

Last month, during a meeting with governors, Biden made similar remarks when it came to testing capacities across the country.

""It’s not enough. It’s clearly not enough. If we’d have known, we’d have gone harder, quicker if we could have,"" Biden said.

Biden promised on the campaign trail that he would ""massively surge a nationwide campaign and guarantee regular, reliable, and free access to testing for all."" That was not the case over the holidays, with pharmacies running out of rapid tests and hours-long lines at free testing locations nationwide.

As the administration now works to fulfill the demand for COVID-19 tests amid the spread of the omicron variant, it launched a website on Tuesday that allows Americans to request up to four free COVID-19 tests that will be shipped in coordination with the United States Postal Service.

While the administration claims the tests will ship later this month, a pilot test for the program revealed glitches, according to social media users, including for residents of apartment buildings and people who receive their mail at post office boxes.

But despite allegedly admitting to the crime in a conversation with a Mount Pleasant detective, he hasn’t had his day in court in that case due to a 1,330-case COVID-19 backlog in the county, according to a court clerk and records.

""The Kupfer case is such a sad and unnecessary tragedy,"" Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who lives in LA, told Fox News Digital Wednesday. ""Like [Darrell] Brooks in Wisconsin, if prosecutors had done their job, innocent people may be alive today.""

UCLA STUDENT BRIANNA KUPFER'S ALLEGED KILLER ARRESTED IN PASADENA

Smith has been out for years on $50,000 bond, of which he paid less than the standard 10%, according to the bail bondsman, who declined to give a specific figure.

At 9:30 a.m. on Nov. 10, 2019, Smith pulled his 2006 Pontiac G6 up alongside Anthony Jayubo’s 2008 Mercedes near the intersection of Highway 17 and Indigo Market Drive in the town of Mount Pleasant, court documents show.

Jayubo had his toddler son in the back seat.

Smith allegedly fired a flare gun at the back window – which police said had ""contact and burn marks,"" but it does not appear that the child was injured. Police charged him with discharging a firearm at an occupied vehicle, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

Court records show no activity on the case between March 2020 and Wednesday, when prosecutors moved for a bond revocation.

The Ninth Circuit Solicitor's Office in South Carolina did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

With that case pending, Smith also racked up charges in California before police in Pasadena arrested him Wednesday in alleged connection with Kupfer’s stabbing death.

He was busted Oct. 27, 2020, outside Home Depot allegedly in possession of stolen property. He was issued a citation and ordered to appear in court but the office of the prior Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey declined to prosecute, Covina Police Department spokesman Sgt. Joshua Turner told Fox News Digital.

On the anniversary of the Biden's inauguration, that effort is still a work in progress amid a massive spike in cases with the omicron wave.

Biden also promised on the campaign trail that he would ""massively surge a nationwide campaign and guarantee regular, reliable, and free access to testing for all.""

Deaths and hospitalizations are also near their pandemic highs. Biden oversaw hundreds of thousands of coronavirus deaths during his first year in office. In fact, more people died from the virus in 2021 than did in 2020.

Biden said during a presidential debate that former President Donald Trump didn't deserve to stay in office when there were just 220,000 Americans dead under his watch.

""Two hundred twenty thousand Americans dead,"" Biden said at the Oct. 22, 2020 presidential debate. ""Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America.""

About 400,000 Americans died from COVID-19 during Biden's presidency so far.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FREE N95 MASKS

Biden can claim a significant win in his battle against the virus, with the United States' massive vaccination drive.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. administered more than 525 million COVID-19 vaccine doses since they became available.

Biden was not in office when the vaccines were developed under Operation Warp Speed. In fact, he raised doubts that Operation Warp Speed could ""secure trust from Americans who depend on its success.""

But Biden was the president when the vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines were administered, and has been the top national proponent of the vaccine as the U.S. administered a massive amount of jabs during his first year.

OMICRON VARIANT NOW 99.5% OF US COVID CASES, CDC SAYS

Nearly 67% of people over five years-old are vaccinated – totaling 209 million Americans – and almost 80 million Americans took a booster shot, according to the CDC. And perhaps most important, 88% of people aged 65 or older are fully vaccinated.

However, the White House's vaccine mandate for workers at big companies was struck down at the Supreme Court, and there are many Americans resistant to taking the COVID-19 vaccine.

And despite the shortage of coronavirus tests over the holidays, the White House this week rolled out its program allowing Americans to order free at-home tests. People who receive and take the at-home tests are not required to report results, which some critics say could skew records of how wide COVID-19 has spread.

Decreasing case severity is emboldening Biden's opponents to argue the U.S. needs to ease up on its virus mitigation measures like social distancing, masking, and requiring students to stay home from school if exposed to the virus. Those measures are having unintended consequences from development and emotional issues for children to significant hardship for small business owners, Biden's critics say, and they aren't justified for a virus those critics say is already endemic

But Psaki said this month Biden's ""ultimate goal continues to be to defeat the virus."" And the CDC is still pushing strict guidance recommending things like canceling school band, football and wrestling, while using universal masking, social distancing and at-home quarantine for students who come in contact with a COVID-19 positive person.

There's elimination and eradication.""

Fauci said it's extremely rare to eradicate or eliminate a disease, and that the control stage may be a long way off. And he wouldn't even predict what society might look like when that happens.

He required deep sedation, a breathing tube and was hooked up to a ventilator due to his oxygen levels, FOX 9 Minneapolis reported.

Allina Health did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. The New York Post reported that the hospital allegedly did not believe he had a chance for survival.

Anne Quiner was appointed by her husband, who was unvaccinated, to make health care decisions on his behalf. She claimed that without legal intervention her ""husband will die,"" the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported, citing a petition.

""I have advised the doctors that I vehemently disagree with this action and do not want my husband's ventilator turned off,"" court papers stated.

2022-01-19 02:20:00+00:00,68,"FIRST ON FOX: GOP lawmakers on Tuesday asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for answers as to why the top agency did not rely on its typical committee approval process before authorizing a third Pfizer COVID shot for children ages 12-15.

In a letter to FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock, more than two dozen Republicans in the House and Senate questioned the decision by the administration to forego the approval of the booster shot by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).

FDA APPROVES PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BOOSTERS FOR CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 12

""This is extremely puzzling and, frankly, quite troubling,"" the lawmakers, led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Chip Roy wrote. ""Children are still growing and developing, and these are relevant factors for consideration to ensure that this additional vaccine dosage is appropriate, especially as early teens in the 12 to 15 age group are at extremely low-risk for death and hospitalization from COVID-19.""

The VRBPAC voted in September 2021 to authorize a third Pfizer shot for adults 18 years and older who had already received the first two rounds of vaccine shots at least six months prior. The committee then voted to authorize the additional Moderna booster in October 2021. But the committee does not appear to have approved such authorization for Pfizer booster shot for children, despite granting FDA approval on Jan. 3.

The group of Republicans argued that uncertainties surrounding the vaccine remain when it comes to children getting the jab.

CDC RECOMMENDS PFIZER COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT AT 5 MONTHS

The lawmakers pointed to a non-peer-reviewed study that has suggested that boys ages 12-15 who received the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine may have been under a higher risk of cardiac adverse events (CAE).

""One study found that CAE in boys without comorbidities aged 12-15 who received their second vaccine was 3.7 to 6.1 times higher than their 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization risk,"" the lawmakers wrote. Though it is important to note the study said its research has ""yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.""

Additionally, the lawmakers noted another study that found myopericarditis, a condition that relates to inflammation of the heart, occurred in 1 in 2,650 boys ages 12-17 after their second shot of the vaccine. The study also noted it has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Lawmakers additionally questioned whether the White House or Dr. Anthony Fauci were involved in the authorization-making process.

""Democrats from Joe Biden all the way down to county and city officials have spent the last two years trying to stop parents from choosing what’s best for their children by closing schools, imposing authoritarian mandates, and selectively enforcing lockdowns. These petty tyrants have shamefully vilified and persecuted the parents who dared to challenge them. Parents are right to stand up for the kids and demand answers and accountability, and I’m proud to fight for them,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital.

2022-01-18 18:03:22+00:00,24,"FIRST ON FOX – Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C, on Tuesday led 16 other Republicans in sending a letter to National Institutes of Health (NIH) Acting Director Lawrence Tabak, asking him to examine the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and closures on Americans' health.

Murphy, a practicing physician who serves on the GOP Doctors Caucus, highlights several concerning health outcomes impacting Americans stemming from COVID-19 lockdowns, besides COVID-19 itself, in his letter to Tabak.

""I want to help restore faith in medicine to the American public,"" Murphy told Fox News Digital of his letter. ""I also want real answers. … Did we go overboard because we kept only focusing on one thing during this entire time period? In my opinion, I think we should have had a much more selective approach of helping those who are at high risk rather than just a shotgun approach to everybody.""

The congressman added that he is asking the NIH for data on the adverse reactions of COVID-19 lockdowns because he believes the ""shotgun approach"" to mitigating COVID-19 may have done ""more harm than good.""

Those health concerns stemming form COVID-19 lockdowns Murphy mentions in his letter include the mental and physical toll school closures had on children; a reduction in elective surgeries and subsequent rise in cardiac arrests and cancer diagnoses during initial COVID-19 lockdowns; the mental health impact of business closures and jobs lost due to vaccine mandates; and an increase in domestic violence cases during lockdowns.

""While it's important that we've worked on preventing deaths from COVID, the other forms of death in our life — medical death — I believe, have been neglected,"" Murphy told Fox News Digital of the letter. ""And so, I think it's fair that we study this type of thing to keep everything in balance and put everything in perspective.""

OMICRON'S RAPID SPREAD LIKELY DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO EVADE IMMUNITY OFFERED BY VACCINES, STUDY FINDS

Murphy cites several studies in his letter, including a 2021 Stanford University study of more than 13 million U.S. surgical procedures between Jan. 1, 2019, through Jan. 30, 2021, in which researchers found a 48% decrease in total surgical procedures ""immediately after the March 2020 recommendation to cancel elective surgical procedures.""

The congressman also noted research from Dr. Kennith Layton, a Dallas-based neuroradiologist, who reported a ""30 percent decrease in patients presenting ischemic stroke symptoms"" between January and March of 2020. During the same time period, Layton noted a ""threefold increase in patients too late to intervene.""

U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in December issued a national advisory warning of a growing youth mental health crisis amid COVID-19.

Early data show emergency room (ER) visits for suicide attempts among adolescent girls, in particular, rose by 51% during COVID-19 and ER visits among adolescent boys increased by 4% during the same time period. There were more than 6,600 suicide deaths among U.S. youth ages 10 to 24 in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

FENTANYL OVERDOSES BECOME NO. 1 CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG US ADULTS, AGES 18-45: ‘A NATIONAL EMERGENCY’

Daily screen time among adolescents more than doubled from 3.8 hours per day to 7.7 hours per day during the pandemic due to school closures, according to a 2021 study from researchers at the University of California and University of Toronto that Murphy cites in his letter.

Additionally, nearly 79,000 people between 18 and 45 years old — 37,208 in 2020 and 41,587 in 2021 — died of fentanyl poising deaths between 2020 and 2021, according to a data analysis from opioid awareness organization Families Against Fentanyl based on CDC data. Overall drug overdose deaths are expected to surpass 100,000 in 2021, according to preliminary CDC data, representing a 28% increase between April 2020 and April 2021.

Fentanyl drug seizures at the border have reached record highs in 2021, according to data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as the Biden administration faces a continuing crisis at the southern border.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas filed the lawsuit in federal court on Thursday on behalf of the inmates. Those named in the suit were the Washington County jail, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder and Dr. Robert Karas.

HOW TO GET AN AT-HOME COVID-19 TEST

The lawsuit states that after the detainees tested positive for COVID-19 in August 2021 they were told they were being given ""’vitamins,’ ‘antibiotics,’ and/or ‘steroids.""’ The inmates claim they were never told ivermectin was among the medications in their treatment.

But in August, Helder revealed that ivermectin had been prescribed to inmates to treat their COVID-19.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions. The FDA has not approved its use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. According to the FDA, side effects for the drug include skin rash, nausea and vomiting.

""The truth, however, was that without knowing and voluntary consent, plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all agree is not an effective treatment against COVID-19, and that if given in large doses is dangerous for humans,"" the lawsuit said.

The four inmates suffered side effects from taking the drug including vision issues, diarrhea and stomach cramps, according to the lawsuit. The inmates are asking that they receive a medical evaluation by a provider not affiliated with Karas.

Karas has said he began giving ivermectin at the jail in November 2020. In a September letter sent by his attorney, Karas told a Medical Board investigator that 254 inmates at the jail had been treated with ivermectin.

The state Medical Board has been investigating complaints against Karas over the jail’s use of ivermectin, and is expected to discuss the investigation at its February meeting.

At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, students and staff will be required to wear either an N95 or KN95 mask or a combination of a cloth mask with a surgical mask upon returning to campus, the school announced Friday. Masks will be distributed at several locations around the university.

In addition, the school has imposed a Feb. 1 deadline for booster shots and students on campus will be tested twice weekly. Those returning to live on campus will be tested and required to quarantine until they get a negative result.

""COVID is a serious and exhausting challenge, but it is important to emphasize how much better prepared we are to face the virus now than we were when it first emerged almost two years ago,"" read the joint message from school officials.

Classes resume Jan. 24.

Several other universities have already announced plans to shift to online classes at the beginning of this year, including Duke University , American University , Georgetown University , Stanford University , Northwestern University , Belmont University , and most University of California system campuses.

In a letter to Georgetown school officials, the Conservative and Libertarian Student Association at Georgetown Law argued against virtual instruction since the school has implemented vaccine and mask mandates.

""Every student stepping on campus this upcoming semester will be fully vaccinated with boosters, unless they have received one of the University’s illusive exemptions,"" Luke Bunting and Elana Quint, co-presidents of the group, wrote. ""If these vaccines are effective, as the school continually claims, why is virtual instruction – an option the University and Law Center acknowledge comes with significant costs to learning, engagement, and student wellbeing – even an option in a post-vaccine word?""

The opposition to remote learning has prompted some students to demand refunds or discounts from colleges.

Other higher education institutions have decided to push back return dates for undergraduates, including Princeton University, which extended its Jan. 7 date to Friday, Jan. 14. Students have had to submit to testing upon arrival in preparation for classes to start on Jan. 24.

The University of Texas at Dallas initially targeted Jan. 10 for students to return, but moved it to Tuesday to ""assess the progression of the virus and … give our faculty, staff and students a bit more time to prepare if our instructional modalities have to be adjusted,"" the school said.

2022-01-17 19:15:00+00:00,55,"SSM Health, a Catholic hospital chain that operates 23 hospitals across the Midwest, has stopped using race as a determining factor for prioritizing COVID-19 treatment, the chain announced Friday after receiving a legal threat from a nonprofit conservative law firm.

Attorneys at the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL) issued a letter Friday to SSM Health warning that it is illegal to distribute monoclonal antibody products (mAbs) based on race. The letter cited a Dec. 31 email to physicians by SSM Health that referenced a risk scoring calculator, in which non-White patients received a 7-point head start out of 20 total and were therefore more likely to receive life-saving medical treatment over White patients with medically recognized co-morbidities or symptoms, the attorneys argued.

MINNESOTA REMOVES RACE AS A FACTOR FOR COVID TREATMENT ELIGIBILITY AFTER PRESSURE

""For example, a 50-year-old white female (15 points) suffering from obesity (1 point), asthma (1 point), and hypertension (1 point) would not be eligible for mAbs because she does not receive the 20-point minimum score under the calculator,"" the letter stated. ""On the other hand, an otherwise healthy 50-year-old African-American female (22 points), without any of these health risks, would be eligible.""

""The approach taken by your calculator is not only profoundly unethical and immoral, it is illegal,"" the attorneys argued.

SSM Health, which operates hospitals in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, said Friday that the calculator referenced in WILL’s letter was outdated and no longer being used.

""While early versions of risk calculators across the nation appropriately included race and gender criteria based on initial outcomes, SSM Health has continued to evaluate and update our protocols weekly to reflect the most up-to-date clinical evidence available,"" the company said in a statement, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. ""As a result, race and gender criteria are no longer utilized. The internal memo cited by WILL inadvertently referenced an expired calculator.""

SSM Health said the calculator was updated before WILL’s letter was received Friday, but it did not specify when, the Sentinel reported.

The hospital chain had said previously that the ""ethical justification"" for the race-based policy was that ""COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on low income communities and certain racial/ethnic minorities in the United States,"" according to the Dec. 31 email obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

WILL attorney Dan Lennington responded to SSM Health's announcement Friday, arguing that race should never have been a factor in prioritizing treatment.

""We’re encouraged that SSM Health has dropped the racial classifications from their risk-scoring calculator,"" Lennington said, the Sentinel reported. ""But if they updated this calculator before today, we have yet to see any communication to Wisconsin physicians on the matter.

He is supposed to be the No. 1 seed in the upcoming Australian Open tournament, which he has won a record nine times already. But he might not get to play this year and has been threatened with arrest and even deportation.

Alex Hawke, Australia’s minister for immigration, citizen and migrant services, said in a statement Friday that he was exercising power under the country’s Migration Act to cancel Djokovic’s visa once again, days after a judge overturned the first cancellation.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC GETS AUSTRALIAN VISA CANCELED AGAIN, FACES DEPORTATION

He said he did so ""on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so.""

He framed Djokovic’s vaccine status as a border security issue and said he based his decision after receiving information from the country’s Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force.

In response, the Border Force said it could confirm that Djokovic ""failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia.""

""Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia,"" the Force said in a statement.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC IS 'PLAYING BY HIS OWN RULES,' AUSTRALIAN OPEN FAVORITE SAYS

Djokovic was expected to meet with authorities and be placed in immigration detention – which in his case could be a hotel similar to the one he spent four nights in last week during his initial visa snafu.

The Border Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Djokovic's whereabouts.

Djokovic, a 20-time major champion and the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, is unvaccinated.

But Australian rules require all Australian Open participants and foreign visitors to be vaccinated unless they have a medical exemption.

In an Instagram post Wednesday, Djokovic said he tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-December. He canceled most of his public appearances but sat for an interview with a French magazine, during which he said he socially distanced and wore a mask, except for when he posed for a photo.

Then he went into isolation ahead of the tournament.

""It is always an honor and a privilege to play in the Australian Open,"" he said. ""The Australian Open is much-loved by players, fans and the community, not just in Victoria and in Australia, but around the globe.""

Djokovic had argued last month that because he contracted COVID-19 naturally, he should get a medical exemption to the vaccine requirement under the tournament’s rules. Officials initially granted him one – but the Australian Border Force canceled his visa when he landed in Melbourne last week.

2022-01-14 05:33:00+00:00,51,"The race to track the spread of COVID-19 is taking scientists into the sewers.

They’re using wastewater to detect the virus even before people start visiting doctors and hospitals.

The state of Nevada announced its first known case of the omicron variant on Dec. 14 after a woman tested positive.

Scientists at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas detected the variant a week before.

""As we bring it up, we harvest about 500 milliliters of sewage, and this is what you’ll see,"" said Dr. Edwin Oh, an associate professor at the UNLV School of Medicine and the Nevada Institute of Medicine.

OMICRON COVID-19 VARIANT FOUND IN WASTEWATER OF CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, TEXAS CITIES

For the past two years, Dr. Oh and his students have spent hours each day analyzing wastewater to see how much of the virus is in southern Nevada.

""We can go to a stadium and we can tell you that in the stadium, you have extraordinary levels of a virus, therefore it could be a superspreader event,"" Dr. Oh said.

Under the wastewater surveillance program, UNLV and the Southern Nevada Water Authority collect samples from sewers and water treatment facilities.

Then, they test the samples in a lab.

""In the simplest sense, everybody poops, and so we get that information regardless if they’re going out and getting those clinical tests,"" said Dr. Daniel Gerrity, the SNWA’s principal research lab scientist. ""It’s not just something we want to send down the pipe and get rid of. It’s a treasure trove of information.""

Scientists have been able to detect new variants of the virus weeks or even up to a month before anyone receives a positive test result.

Virus levels may rise in wastewater before an outbreak is detected because people can shed the virus in their waste several days before they might show symptoms and get tested.

'CONCERNING' LEVELS OF COVID-19 DETECTED IN FLORIDA COUNTY WASTEWATER, OFFICIALS SAY

""Having that wastewater surveillance, you’ll know without testing anyone whether you have a pathogen or you have a drug circulating in that community,"" Dr. Oh said.

The most shocking moment was when Omicron appeared.

""For Omicron, in certain cities, we went from 20% of a community having Omicron all the way to 95% in a week, and that was a big surprise for us,"" Dr. Oh said. ""It just shows how quickly a pathogen can enter into a community and just simply take over.""

Wastewater surveillance has been used before in discovering cases of polio and the presence of drugs.

Now, it's becoming more widespread in the U.S. to fight COVID-19.

At least 34 states and the District of Columbia have a program like this.

The CDC also has its own National Wastewater Surveillance System .

The technique helps narrow down where a majority of the virus is, and for tourist cities like Las Vegas, it’s a good indicator of who is infected.

MISSOURI LAB DETECTED DELTA COVID-19 VARIANT IN WASTEWATER WEEKS BEFORE FIRST CASE WAS REPORTED

""Our hypothesis right now is that we’re getting a significant fraction of SARS-COVID-2 nucleic acid from the people who are visiting and not just the local community,"" Dr. Gerrity said. ""In more recent months, tourism is almost back to its levels of pre-pandemic time. What we’ve seen is that we have higher concentrations in the wastewater than we had seen previously.""

Wastewater surveillance has also been used to spot COVID-19 upticks in college dorms, prisons and other large settings.

Researchers at the University of Miami found that the ""widespread blood vessel dysfunction, or endothelial dysfunction, that results from the COVID-19 infection could then contribute to erectile dysfunction.""

Some have criticized China’s ""Zero COVID"" policy as harsh and extreme, with entire cities in lockdown after detecting just a few cases of COVID-19. To ensure the 2022 Winter Olympics run smoothly, China has gone so far as to utilize massive ""camps"" where people quarantine for two weeks.

Video on Twitter shows rows of the box structures, which come complete with a bed and a toilet, and even elderly people and pregnant women are not exempt, according to Indian news outlet First Post. The camp reportedly exists within Xi’an, which has fast become the epicenter of the current outbreak in China.

He asks that they let him finish his meal or get his phone, but the workers drag him into the street and stop to ask him only to put his facemask on.

Residents of Xi’an faced a ""midnight quarantine"" during which officials informed residents just as the New Year began that they had to leave their homes to go to the quarantine facilities, the BBC reported. One person reported seeing 30 buses outside the compound, with another person claiming that thousands of people were moved.

2022-01-13 18:35:08+00:00,18,"The American Cancer Society (ACS) in a new report said lung cancer incidence and mortality were declining.

The group used incidence data through 2018 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the National Program of Cancer Registries and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data through 2019 was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics.

FLORIDA BOY, 6, BATTLING CANCER NAMED POLICE CAPTAIN FOR THE DAY

Lung cancer incidence reportedly fell for advanced disease, while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, ""contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21% to 31%).""

Mortality patterns reflected incidence trends, with declines ""accelerating for lung cancer.""

In addition, declines slowed for breast cancer and stabilized for prostate cancer.

""In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment,"" the society wrote. ""More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.""

The report also highlighted that incidence from 2014 to 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer and remained stable for prostate cancer – despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011.

The proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased to 8.2% from 3.9% over the past decade.

The ACS projected that there would be 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths in the U.S., noting that cancer rates have continued to decline since the 1990s.

That number includes approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer – more than breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers combined and 2.5 times more than CRC.

2022-01-12 23:20:00+00:00,33,"The U.S. Army, for the first time, is offering a maximum enlistment bonus of $50,000 to highly skilled recruits who join for six years, The Associated Press has learned, as the service struggles to lure soldiers into certain critical jobs amid the continuing pandemic.

Maj. Gen. Kevin Vereen, head of Army Recruiting Command, told AP that shuttered schools and the competitive job market over the past year have posed significant challenges for recruiters. So heading into the most difficult months of the year for recruiting, the Army is hoping that some extra cash and a few other changes will entice qualified young people to sign up.

""We are still living the implications of 2020 and the onset of COVID, when the school systems basically shut down,"" said Vereen. ""We lost a full class of young men and women that we didn’t have contact with, face-to-face.""

Two years of the pandemic has made it more difficult to recruit in schools and at public events, and the competition for quality workers has intensified as young people weigh their options.

Some, said Vereen, are taking what he calls a gap year, and ""are making the decision that they don’t necessarily need to work right now.""

ALASKA SEES FIFTH US SOLDIER DIE IN STATE SINCE NOVEMBER

The annual recruiting goal fluctuates as currently serving soldiers decide whether to reenlist or leave. In the last two years, as the pandemic raged, many decided to stay in, lessening the pressure on recruiting. Last year's recruiting goal was 57,500, and Vereen said it will be about the same this year.

To entice recruits, those who sign up for a six-year enlistment in one of several high-demand career fields can get bonuses that total as much as $50,000. Given the high standards, it will be difficult for many to qualify for the top bonus.

The final figure depends on when they agree to ship out for training, if they already have critical skills and if they choose airborne or ranger posts. Certain careers — such as missile defense crew, special forces, signals intelligence and fire control specialists who coordinate battlefield weapons operations — can often come with the maximum bonuses. But other key jobs include infantry, intelligence analyst, combat medic specialist, military police, combat engineer and several others. And those may change every month, based on available spots in the training pipeline and other service needs.

Until now, the Army has offered a maximum bonus of $40,000.

""We’re in a competitive market,"" said Vereen. ""How we incentivize is absolutely essential, and that is absolutely something that we know that is important to trying to get somebody to come and join the military.'

Sgt. 1st Class Mary James has been working as a recruiter in Ohio since November 2020, and she said the early months — when COVID-19 was surging and there were no vaccines — were challenging. It's gotten better, and she said the higher bonuses will help her.

""Money isn’t always the first thing that they talk about, but it does come into play,"" said James, who's been in the Army for 15 years. ""It will be exciting to see what the return is on that. You know, I think it does put us in one of the top tier levels of competitive businesses.""

James, who previously worked as a signals intelligence analyst, can also talk to recruits about deploying to war zones, and the exciting opportunities the military offers. And she said she hears a lot of questions and worries about stability, leaving home and a career that may have them moving from place to place every few years.

Vereen said the Army is doing more to address those types of concerns. Last fall the Army significantly increased the option to enlist for two years, expanding it to a total of 84 different career fields. And some will be able to choose where they will initially be assigned — a benefit Army leaders approved in an effort to be more family friendly and bolster the recruiting effort, particularly in the pandemic.

OLDEST WWII VETERAN IN US DIES AT 112

According to Vereen, the total amount of bonuses available hasn't been set. But the money has decreased every year since a peak of more than $485 million in 2018, after the Army failed to meet its annual recruiting goal. In the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, the Army spent more than $233 million on bonuses, with about 16,500 recruits getting an average enlistment bonus of more than $14,000.

""We want to promote the value of serving your country first,"" said Vereen. ""But we also know that, this generation and I guess human nature, you know, it’s all about compensation, too.""

For James, the money may help her meet her recruiting goal as the Army heads into what it calls the ""bathtub"" months of February to May, when recruiting is historically at its low point. During the spring, the Army's more than 9,400 recruiters have to seek out and sign up people who have already graduated from high school and college. Recruiting traditionally spikes as students graduate in the spring and start looking for jobs.

James said her goal is to get 20 qualified candidates a week to take initial enlistment steps, and last week she made 75% of that. She had more success around the holidays, but it's more difficult now.

Compounding the issue is the highly contagious omicron variant, which is prompting some school systems to shut down — just as recruiters want to get into the schools or get out to sports events to woo candidates.

As a result, Brig. Gen. John Cushing, the deputy commander at Recruiting Command, said the Army decided to tweak its bonus systems. In previous years, said Cushing, the Army spread out the bonuses. ""sort of evenly like peanut butter across the whole accessions (recruiting) year."" This year, the money will be concentrated in the next few months when it is really needed.

And, the recommendation is not going to change,"" she told reporters during the White House COVID-19 response team briefing.

And, we want to provide Americans [with] the best and most updated information to choose what mask is going to be right for them,"" she added.

The statement comes on the heels of one recent study that said cloth masks may not even be effective at protecting against the omicron variant of COVID-19.

The Washington Post reported Monday that the agency was working to update its guidance to recommend people opt for the highly protective N95 or K95 masks, citing ""an official close to the deliberations.""

""The agency is currently actively looking to update its recommendations for KN95 and N95 in light of omicron,"" the official reportedly said. ""We know these masks provide better filtration.""

CALIFORNIA EXTENDS MASK MANDATE THROUGH FEB. 15 AMID SURGE OF COVID-19 CASES

As the omicron variant continues to surge, sending hospitalizations and case numbers skyrocketing to record highs, Walensky cited a preprinted study of data from Southern California's Kaiser Permanente that had been analyzed by academic partners with CDC collaboration and funding.

The data, she continued, ""provided key insight into clinical outcomes"" among patients infected with the variant of concern, using mathematical modeling to estimate the risk of hospitalization and severe disease.

""The data in this study remained consistent with what we are seeing from omicron in other countries, including South Africa and the U.K., and provides some understanding of what we can expect over the coming weeks as cases are predicted to peak in this country,"" Walensky explained.

While early evidence shows omicron is less severe than the delta variant – with those infected less likely to require hospitalization – she instructed that it was important to note that omicron continues to be much more transmissible.

""We must do – all of us – do our part to protect our hospitals and our neighbors and reduce the further spread of this virus,"" Walensky stated, encouraging Americans to wear masks in public indoor settings with high transmission, testing before gathering with others and staying ""up to date"" on COVID-19 vaccinations.",FoxNews,"['masks', 'covid19', 'director', 'peak', 'update', 'study', 'note', 'cdc', 'walensky', 'guidance', 'mask', 'variant', 'provide', 'predicted', 'change', 'omicron', 'face']",0

Omicron, which studies show is more transmissible but less lethal than previous variants, now accounts for 98.3% of all new cases in the United States.

The CDC said that it took the economic and ""societal impact"" into account when it halved the isolation and quarantine time from 10 days to 5 days for all workers nationwide.

""Spread of the Omicron variant has the potential to worsen staffing shortages and increase supply chain challenges, which jeopardize industry, education, and other systems that are essential to maintain a functioning society and economy,"" the CDC explained.",FoxNews,"['staffing', 'covid19', 'amid', 'states', 'cdc', 'nearly', 'shortage', 'hospitals', 'critical', 'health', 'care', 'record', 'cases', 'workers', 'work', 'report']",0
2022-01-12 01:10:00+00:00,53,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez proposed treating COVID-19 as an ""endemic disease"" rather than a pandemic this week, saying that the country is considering a move to start tracking the virus like the flu instead of counting every case.

""I believe that we have the conditions for, with precaution, slowly, opening the debate at the technical level and at the level of health professionals, but also at the European level, to start evaluating the evolution of this disease with different parameters than we have until now,"" Sánchez told a Spanish radio station on Monday.

Sánchez's comments come after El País reported that Spanish health officials are preparing to roll out a new system to track COVID-19 like other respiratory illnesses by not testing every mildly symptomatic case and using smaller samples to monitor the spread.

""We are going to have to learn to live with it [the coronavirus] as we do with many other viruses,"" Sánchez said Friday, noting that the virus's lethality has decreased, according to the Spanish newspaper.

The World Health Organization warned against treating COVID-19 as endemic yet. Senior Emergency Officer for Europe Catherine Smallwood explained that an endemicity assumes ""the stable circulation of the virus at predictable levels.""

CDC RECOMMENDS PFIZER COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT AT 5 MONTHS

""What we’re seeing at the moment coming into 2022 is nowhere near that. We still have a huge amount of uncertainty and a virus that is evolving quite quickly, imposing new challenges,"" Smallwood said at a news conference Tuesday.



""We are certainly not at the point where we are able to call it endemic,"" she added. ""It may become endemic in due course, but pinning that down to 2022 is a little bit difficult at this stage.""

Nadhim Zahawi, the British education secretary and former minister for vaccine deployment, said Sunday that the United Kingdom might lead the way in treating COVID-19 as endemic.

""I hope we will be one of the first major economies to demonstrate to the world how you transition from pandemic to endemic, and then deal with this however long it remains with us, whether that's five, six, seven, 10 years,"" Zahawi told Sky News.

Treating COVID-19 as endemic would mean focusing efforts on increasing immune protection through vaccination and ramping up treatments instead of trying to eradicate the virus completely.

""The expected continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2 stands in contrast with the first round of SARS in 2003 and with the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in 2014, when public health measures ultimately stopped spread and brought both outbreaks to an end,"" Yonatan Grad, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard University, explained last year.

Omicron is likely more transmissible due to its ability to evade immunity offered by prior infection and vaccines, but it is also associated with less severe illness, according to multiple studies.

Europe reported more than 7 million new cases of COVID-19 in the first week of January, more than doubling in two weeks, according to the World Health Organization.

2022-01-11 21:35:22+00:00,164,"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Tuesday announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19 despite being vaccinated.

Lightfoot said she was experiencing ""cold-like symptoms"" but feels fine otherwise – which she credited to being vaccinated and boosted.

""I will continue to work from home while following the CDC guidelines for isolation,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""This is an urgent reminder for folks to get vaccinated and boosted as it’s the only way to beat this pandemic.""

Lightfoot joins a long list of Democratic politicians who have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks. Since December, Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., have tested positive.

MICHIGAN'S WHITMER ISOLATING FROM HUSBAND AFTER HE TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19

Lightfoot’s announcement came after the Chicago Teachers Union approved a plan with the city’s school district over COVID-19 safety protocols, ending a bitter standoff that canceled classes for five days.

Approved late Monday, the deal would have students back in class on Wednesday and teachers back a day earlier. It still requires approval from the union's roughly 25,000 members, with voting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.

CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION VS. CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS: WHAT HAPPENED?

Chicago Teachers Union spokesperson Ronnie Reese confirmed the goal to bring students back on Wednesday, even as the vote proceeds.

Neither side disclosed full details of the proposal Monday evening, but leaders generally said the agreement included metrics to close individual schools during outbreaks and plans to boost COVID-19 testing in the largely low-income Black and Latino school district of about 350,000 students.

The union last week called for districtwide online learning until a safety plan could be negotiated or the latest COVID-19 surge subsided. The district, which has rejected districtwide remote instruction, responded by locking teachers out of remote teaching systems two days after students returned from winter break. The union's house of delegates voted Monday evening to suspend their work action.

CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION CONCEDES TO MAYOR LIGHTFOOT'S COVID-19 SAFETY PROPOSAL: ‘A ONE-WOMAN KAMIKAZE’

Parents and advocacy groups also stepped up calls Monday for quicker action. Some parents on the city's West Side demanded students return immediately.

District officials, who call the union action ""an illegal stoppage,"" had kept buildings open for student meal pickup and said schools with enough staff were allowed to open their doors to students. Some teachers showed up despite union directives; district officials estimated about 16% of teachers did so Monday.

City officials argued that schools are safe with protocols in place. School leaders have touted a $100 million safety plan, including air purifiers in each classroom. Roughly 91% of staff are vaccinated and masks are required indoors.

Union officials argued that the safety measures fell short and that the district botched both testing and a database tracking infections.

Several liberal journalists have appeared to shift their thinking on coronavirus mandates and lock-downs in the wake of officials' response to the omicron variant.

2022-01-11 05:30:00+00:00,59,"Deltacron, the reported new variant of COVID-19 said to combine both delta and omicron variants, has sparked a reaction of skepticism from world health experts.

Scientists have expressed their doubts about its existence to various media platforms, saying that deltacron is likely the result of a lab contamination error. However, on Monday, the scientist behind the discovery defended his findings. A Cyprus researcher discovered deltacron, according to a report in Bloomberg News Saturday.

According to the report, Leondios Kostrikis, who is a biological sciences professor at the University of Cyprus, discovered a genetic background of the delta variant along with some mutations of omicron. The media report stated that Kostrikis and his team claim to have found 25 cases and sent the findings to GISAID, an international database that tracks changes in the virus.

Kostrikis told the Cyprus Sigma TV network last week, ""We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious,"" but he told the media outlet that the dominant strain will be omicron, according to multiple reports.

Dr. Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Imperial College in London, tweeted that the anomaly appears to be ""quite clearly contamination"" and said that it does not meet the criteria for a new variant.

OMICRON, DELTA HAVE FUSED INTO NEW 'DELTACRON' STRAIN

Another World Health Organization COVID-19 expert, Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, also wrote on her Twitter account, ""This is likely sequencing artifact (lab contamination of Omicron fragments in a Delta specimen)"".

Amidst the backlash, Kostrikis defended his findings with an emailed statement Sunday to the Bloomberg media outlet.

Kostrikis told the media outlet that the contamination hypothesis should be ruled out because the deltacron infection rate was higher among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 than among non-hospitalized patients, according to the report.

The researcher in Cyprus said that the cases he identified ""indicate an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event,"" according to the report.

OMICRON CASES SURGE: MORE THAN 4,000 CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED NATIONWIDE, REPORT SAYS

Kostrikis also said in the media report that the samples were processed in multiple sequencing procedures in more than one country. According to his statement in the report, at least one other sequence from Israel was deposited in a global database that exhibited deltacron genetic characteristics.

""These findings refute the undocumented statements that deltacron is a result of a technical error,"" Kostrikis said in the media report.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., emergency department physician Dr. Fred Davis told Fox News, ""The reports out of Cyprus are the first we are hearing of such a variant and will continue to be followed.""

""I want to ask you about those encouraging headlines that we're talking about this morning, this new study showing just how well vaccines are working to prevent severe illness. Given that, is it time to start rethinking how we're living with this virus, that it's potentially here to stay?"" co-host Cecilia Vega asked on Friday's ""Good Morning America.""

Some social media users said the show appeared to edit out the start of Walensky's answer – a common practice on television to fit tight time windows.

""The overwhelming number of death, over 75 percent, occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities,"" Walensky said in the posted video after Vega's question. ""So really, these are people who were unwell to begin with. And yes, really encouraging news in the context of omicron. This means not only just to get your primary series but to get your booster series, and yes, we're really encouraged by these results.""

CDC DIRECTOR WALENSKY FAILS TO DISCLOSE HOW MANY DEATHS WERE ‘FROM’ COVID-19: ‘DATA WILL BE FORTHCOMING’

Critics jumped on Walensky's remarks across the spectrum when they were posted online, with some thinking she was callously encouraged that only those with several underlying factors were dying of the virus, while others thought she was tacitly admitting that the coronavirus death count – officially over 800,000 and counting in the United States – was inflated since those dying had other problems.

However, a CDC spokesman confirmed Walensky's remarks about what was ""really encouraging"" referred to news about the effectiveness of vaccines against the variant, as her ""over 75 percent"" statement was about a newly released CDC study showing those were the deaths that occurred among vaccinated people against coronavirus. In other words, the study found breakthrough coronavirus deaths among the vaccinated were far more likely to occur among people with multiple chronic conditions or risk factors, such as advanced age or immunodeficiency.

""Among 1,228,664 persons who completed primary vaccination during December 2020–October 2021, severe COVID-19–associated outcomes (0.015%) or death (0.0033%) were rare. Risk factors for severe outcomes included age ≥65 years, immunosuppressed, and six other underlying conditions. All persons with severe outcomes had at least one risk factor; 78% of persons who died had at least four,"" the CDC study released Friday said.

Some users like writer James Surowiecki said Walensky appeared to make more remarks on ""Good Morning America"" before her line about the ""over 75 percent.""

IT'S TIME FOR THE CDC TO PIVOT ON COVID TESTING

""Good Morning America screwed over Walensky by the way it edited her comments. If you watch the full section of the clip, she said something before the 75% line, presumably to explain the numbers. But GMA cut it,"" he wrote.

ABC News didn't respond to requests for comment.

A CDC spokesman said she did not mean to offend people with disabilities in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""Dr. Walensky did not intend comments in a recent television appearance to be hurtful toward those with disabilities.

2022-01-09 21:10:00+00:00,86,"Pharmaceutical giant Moderna announced that people may need a second COVID-19 vaccine booster shot while health officials continue to explore the need for further shots.

Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel made the announcement during a Goldman Sachs-organized healthcare conference Thursday.

""I still believe we’re going to need boosters in the fall of ’22 and forward,"" Bancel said.

The announcement follows data from Israel that noted a fourth COVID-19 booster produced a five-fold increase in antibodies just one week after administering the shot. Bancel said the company had started working on a vaccine tailored to the omicron variant, but any such shot would not be available in the next few months, Reuters reported.

But with first boosters only just administered to most eligible adults, data remains light on the actual efficacy or loss of efficacy of the shots, and the Israel study only noted an increase in antibodies and did not say anything about efficacy.

Israel has taken the data as an indication that second boosters will prove necessary.

But some researchers have considered that repeat doses of the same vaccine could dampen the body’s immune response, The Washington Post reported. Other experts questioned the wisdom in rushing yet another shot when some people have yet to receive a single shot at all.

After Gordon called the police and returned to the car, she saw the teen was seated in the back. The child was not harmed, officials said.

Beam is a teacher with the district and has been placed on administrative leave, the district told Fox News.

2022-01-07 17:30:00+00:00,30,"Between a surge of COVID-19 variants, an active flu season and other spreading viruses, determining what an illness is can be tricky.

Experts say that testing is the best way to find out for certain because overlapping symptoms could cause confusion.

NEW YORK, FLORIDA SHATTER SINGLE-DAY RECORDS FOR COVID-19 CASES

For example, influenza symptoms include a fever or chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue and some vomiting and diarrhea.

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever or chills, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, new loss of taste or smell, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.

Common colds tend to be milder, with symptoms including a stuffy nose and sore throat.

Viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19 are spread through droplets from the noses and mouths of those infected – even before symptoms occur.

The time for when someone starts to feel sick varies and some people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, while still having the ability to spread the disease.

Recently, reports have spread about a co-infection nicknamed ""flurona,"" when a person catches COVID-19 and the flu at the same time.

CDC: FLU VIRUS DETECTIONS ON THE RISE, EARLY SIGNS VACCINATION DOWN

However, the viruses have not merged to create a new illness.

In order for medical professionals to prescribe the right treatment for their patients, testing plays an important role.

While at-home tests for flu aren't as widely available as rapid tests for COVID-19, some pharmacies offer testing for both.

Getting vaccinated helps reduce the spread of the viruses.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season – especially those who are at higher risk.

Children ages 5 years and older and adults who are eligible are instructed to get vaccinated against COVID-19 regardless of whether they already have been infected.

2022-01-07 16:02:32+00:00,60,"Democrats have been notably hesitant to criticize President Biden about a continued shortage in testing kits for COVID-19.

An insufficient supply of COVID-19 tests had been a major point of criticism from Democrats toward former President Trump back in 2020.

However, some officials within the Biden administration are failing to grasp the testing strategy nearly two years into the pandemic.

""The White House, in baseball terms, was playing small ball,"" Dr. Steven Phillips, vice president of science and strategy for COVID Collaborative, told Vanity Fair in December. ""When it comes to rapid testing, they’re bunting the players along.""

WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS TESTING RESPONSE AMID SHORTAGE, SAYING IT QUADRUPLED AT-HOME SUPPLY SINCE SEPTEMBER

Until recently, the White House had no plans to provide free tests for individuals. Last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki mockingly dismissed the idea of free tests when it was suggested by NPR reporter Mara Liasson.

""Should we just send one to every American?"" Psaki responded sarcastically. When Liasson said yes, Psaki challenged the idea.

""Then what happens … if every American has one test? How much does that cost, and then what happens after that?""

In April 2020, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., produced an open letter signed by 46 Democrats to former Vice President Pence. The document blasted the administration for ""over-promising and under-delivering"" on COVID-19 tests. It also demanded an increase in transparency and internal scrutiny of the administration's test kit supply lines.

""Given the Administration’s track record of over-promising and under-delivering on testing for COVID-19, the public deserves full transparency about our national capacity for COVID-19 testing, including where tests are available, how many have been conducted, which patients have access to testing, and what the results of these tests revealed,"" the senator wrote in the joint letter.

Just one month later, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., drafted yet another open condemnation of the Trump administration's lack of sufficient testing supplies. This letter – signed again by dozens of Democratic Party leaders – explicitly blamed the federal government in large part for the failure to disperse the necessary kits.

""We are deeply troubled by the lack of detail and strategy in your testing blueprint, and we fundamentally reject the notion that the federal government bears this little responsibility in increasing testing capacity,"" the Democrat leaders wrote.

Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., slammed the Trump administration for testing issues, calling the shortages ""totally inexcusable.""

""[The testing shortage] has been one of the greatest failures of this administration, and I hope they learn from it,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told the hosts of ""The View: in March 2020. ""I want us to come together and solve this problem for people's sake, not get political advantage, but the bottom line is Donald Trump said on March 6th, everyone who needs a test can get a test.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday said the CDC might adopt a new testing recommendation for Americans looking to leave isolation after five days – a measure which would come while COVID-19 test shortages are already plaguing the nation as the omicron variant of the coronavirus surges.

Americans waited for hours in long lines at testing sites as the omicron variant surged over the holiday season, especially after gatherings for Christmas. The White House said Americans would have to wait at least several weeks for the rollout of promised at-home testing kits.

Public Health and Medical Professionals sued the FDA under a Freedom of Information Act that demanded more transparency, Reuters reported last month.

The FDA—citing staffing issues—agreed to release 12,000 pages by the end of January and a ""minimum"" of 500 pages a month going forward, the report said. The group found that number unacceptable and said there are more than 400,000 pages of data needed, which could mean it may be 2097 before all the documents are made public.

U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman called the group’s FOIA request ""of paramount public importance,"" and demanded that the FDA release 55,000 pages a month—which means all information should be available within eight months, Reuter’s Jenna Greene, who had been following the suit, reported.

WILL OMICRON BE LAST COVID-19 VARIANT?

""Even if the FDA may not see it this way, I think Pittman did the agency—and the country—a big favor by expediting the document production,"" she wrote.

The FDA and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News about the order.

Aaron Siri, the lawyer representing the group, called Pittman’s ruling a ""great win for transparency and removes one of the strangleholds federal ‘health’ authorities have had on the data needed for independent scientists to offer solutions and address serious issues with the current vaccine program.""

Siri pointed out that Pittman quoted President John F. Kennedy who said, a ""nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.""

2022-01-07 01:45:00+00:00,16,"Teachers in San Francisco and nearby Oakland, California , are demanding their school districts take more COVID-19 precautions amid the surge of omicron, with some members allegedly threatening walkouts.

Like the Chicago Teachers Union, which is negotiating with the Chicago school district, some United Educators of San Francisco (UESF) members and Oakland teachers may not show up to school in-person this week as they negotiate with their respective districts for more COVID-19 safety measures, according to local reports.

""Our goal is to keep school buildings open safely, and that requires regular, accessible testing and guaranteed COVID sick leave,"" UESF President Cassondra Curiel said in a Wednesday statement. ""The district could have avoided this crisis with forethought and a sincere interest in keeping schools open and kids and educators safe. There have been serious gaps in judgment. But we can all turn it around so that we can give our students the opportunity for a smooth school year.""

Curiel told FOX 2 San Francisco on Wednesday that ""some rank and file members have been passing around a petition"" in response to a question about a potential walkout.

""That's what I know. I know members feel desperate and I don't blame them at all,"" she said.

More than 700 people have signed an online petition calling for a ""sickout"" Thursday.

""Omicron breaks through vaccines and boosters and has a short incubation period. We need regular mandatory testing for all employees and students to ensure that major outbreaks do not occur, especially BEFORE we return to sites,"" the petition states. ""Everyone in schools must be screened, and if ‘we can’t afford it,’ we shouldn’t be opening at all.""

It is unclear how many San Francisco teachers did not show up to class Thursday. The SFUSD did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital regarding the scheduled sickout, but SFUSD Superintendent Vincent Matthews in a Wednesday statement pushed to continue in-person learning amid a surge in omicron cases.

""In-person learning offers the best form of instruction for our students, and even as the pandemic continues, we believe school remains a safer place for our students considering the harmful effects of social isolation and learning loss,"" Matthews said. ""…As we returned from winter break this week, we encouraged testing, set up new testing sites and sent out information about numerous ways to get tested prior to school reopening. Throughout this week and this weekend we are making rapid testing available at several schools and district headquarters.""

The district recently received a new order of COVID-19 tests and has ""begun to prepare them for distribution and delivery to each school site to hand out to students,"" along with personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical and cloth masks, he said.

Meanwhile, the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) on Thursday warned parents of a potential teacher ""sickout"" on Friday, according to an email from OUSD leaders.

""It has come to our attention that some OUSD teachers may be planning an illegal ‘sick out’ tomorrow,"" the email reads. ""… We need to be clear: this action — at whichever school it occurs — is likely to significantly disrupt basic operation and instruction and will negatively impact the safety of students.""

The school district leaders added that ""despite the high number of staff absences this week,"" it has been able to keep schools open due to the amazing dedication of … employees, who have gone above and beyond to cover absences, take additional students, and do what else needs to be done.""

A press release from a group of Oakland Unified teachers and staff from various schools will meet at Leona Canyon Trail Head on Friday and drive as a caravan to the OUSD District Office. Their demands include two weeks of remote learning; the ""mass purchase and distribution of N95/KN95 masks for all staff and students""; weekly PCR testing for all staff and students; retroactive extension of COVID-19 leave between Nov. 7, 2021, and June 20, 2022; a meeting with the Oakland Education Association (OEA) bargaining team; HEPA filters in all cafeterias and large spaces; and more.

Oakland's teachers' union, the Oakland Education Association, did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital.

Most California public schools were closed for a year between March 2020 and March and April 2021.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Dec. 22 affirmed state leaders' ""shared commitment … to keep each other safe and to keep our classrooms open.""

In a statement, the group's president, Dr. Gerald Harmon, said the American people should be able to count on the agency for timely, accurate and clear guidance.

Instead, he said, the CDC's new recommendations are ""not only confusing, but are risking further spread of the virus.""

US ADVISERS ENDORSE PFIZER COVID BOOSTERS FOR YOUNGER TEENS

""With hundreds of thousands of new cases daily and more than a million positive reported cases on January 3, tens of thousands – potentially hundreds of thousands of people – could return to work and school infectious if they follow the CDC’s new guidance on ending isolation after five days without a negative test,"" Harmon said. ""Physicians are concerned that these recommendations put our patients at risk and could further overwhelm our health care system.""

He said that negative tests should be required for ending isolation after a positive test, adding that reemerging without knowing one's status ""unnecessarily risks further transmission of the virus.""

""Test availability remains a challenge in many parts of the country, including in hospitals, and we urge the administration to pull all available levers to ramp up production and distribution of tests. But a dearth of tests at the moment does not justify omitting a testing requirement to exit a now shortened isolation,"" he concluded.

Ahead of the new year, the CDC announced that it would shorten its recommended isolation and quarantine period from 10 to five days.

""People with COVID-19 should isolate for five days and if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving (without fever for 24 hours), follow that by five days of wearing a mask when around others to minimize the risk of infecting people they encounter,"" it said in a statement.

In addition, the CDC said people exposed to COVID-19 who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose – or more than two months after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – and not yet boosted are recommended to quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days.

Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following exposure but are advised to wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure.

CDC DOUBLES DOWN ON ISOLATION GUIDELINES AFTER CRITICISM, SAYS PEOPLE CAN TAKE A TEST IF THEY HAVE 'ACCESS'

For all exposed, best practices would include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day five after exposure, and individuals should immediately quarantine if symptoms occur until testing negative.

While the CDC was criticized over the guidance, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky defended the decision – saying that previous guidance had been ""conservative.""

""The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after,"" the CDC wrote in its guidance.

On Tuesday, the CDC updated its protocol for ending isolation, saying Americans can take a COVID-19 test toward the end of the five-day isolation period if they have ""access.""

The agency said that tests ""are best used early in the course of illness to diagnose COVID-19"" and are not authorized to ""evaluate duration of infectiousness.""

""Data, including a review of 113 studies from 17 countries, show that most SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of infection,"" the CDC wrote in its explanation.

While White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the CDC's decisions were led by science, external factors, like keeping the labor force operational, were also a factor, according to Walensky.

""There are a lot of studies [from other variants] that show the maximum transmissibility is in those first five days,"" Walensky said. ""And [with omicron] we are about to face hundreds of thousands more cases a day, and it was becoming very, very clear from the health care system that we would have people who were [positive but] asymptomatic and not able to work, and that was a harbinger of what was going to come in all other essential functions of society.""

All of this comes as the omicron variant of the coronavirus continues to spread around the country, leading to staffing shortages in multiple fields and an increase in pediatric hospitalizations, with more than 95% of new COVID-19 cases linked to the variant of concern.

Although scientists recognize that the variant is more transmissible than other COVID-19 strains, more research is being done to determine its severity of disease and ability to evade immune response and vaccines – as well as the future of the pandemic in the U.S.

The group, which included 20 sailors who had just entered active service, were removed via entry-level separations, causing them to be separated during their first 180 days.

On Dec. 15, Navy commanders were ordered to begin the separation process for sailors who declined to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

The Navy further said that as of Jan. 5, 2022, the service has approved eight permanent medical exemptions, 242 temporary medical exemptions, 74 administrative exemptions, but no religious exemptions to the vaccine, despite 3,009 active duty requests for one.

LAWSUIT FILED ON BEHALF OF NAVY SEALs FACING INTIMIDATION FOR SEEKING RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS

Among the Navy Reserve, there are presently no permanent medical exemptions, nine temporary medical exemptions, 31 administrative exemptions. None of the 691 religious accommodation requests from Ready Reserve service members have been approved, either.

JUDGE ISSUES STAY AGAINST VACCINE MANDATE FOR NAVY SEALs SEEKING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION

On Dec. 24, the littoral combat ship USS Milwaukee held off on deploying to South America following positive tests from some of its sailors, some of whom exhibited mild symptoms. The crew had been ""100% immunized,"" the Navy said at the time.

Vaccine mandates for the U.S. military have proven to be a point of contention that has led to several lawsuits. No branch of the military has approved a religious accommodation request for the vaccine.

On Monday, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction against a federal vaccine mandate for Navy SEALs who sued President Biden because they were seeking a religious exemption.

Judge Reed O'Connor, the U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas, issued the stay in response to a lawsuit filed by First Liberty Institute in November on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists seeking a religious exemption, as first reported by Fox News Digital.

""The Navy service members in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment,"" O'Connor wrote in his ruling. ""There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""

""We are aware of the injunction and are reviewing it,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby of the ruling at the time.

In a series of opinion articles posted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, Drs. Ezekiel Emanuel, Michael Osterholm, Celine Gounder, David Michaels, Rick Bright and Luciana Borio offered various suggestions for how to move forward.

CDC'S NEW COVID-19 ISOLATION GUIDANCE CALLED OUT BY AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

""As the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates, COVID-19 is here to stay,"" Emanuel, Osterholm and Gounder wrote in a piece in which they say Biden's national strategy for COVID-19 response must be ""updated.""

""The goal for the ‘new normal’ with COVID-19 does not include eradication or elimination, eg, the ‘zero COVID’ strategy. Neither COVID-19 vaccination nor infection appear to confer lifelong immunity,"" they wrote. ""Current vaccines do not offer sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infectious diseases cannot be eradicated when there is limited long-term immunity following infection or vaccination or nonhuman reservoirs of infection.""

The ""new normal,"" they explained, should be ""recognizing that SARS-CoV-2 is but one of several circulating respiratory viruses that include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and more."" They noted that people have been living normal lives while facing the threat of those other respiratory illnesses, and they must learn to view the threat of COVID-19 as just an additional threat alongside the others.

OMICRON, WINTER STROMS HIT US, SCHOOL DISTRICTS CLOSED OR DELAYED ACROSS MANY STATES

Still, they made clear that while this is a goal, COVID-19 is currently more serious than the other illnesses in terms of hospitalizations and fatalities.

""What constitutes appropriate thresholds for hospitalizations and death, at what cost, and with what trade-offs, remains undetermined,"" they said.

What the Biden administration should do, they suggested, is to put in place infrastructure that ""includes real-time electronic collection of comprehensive information on respiratory viral infections, hospitalizations, deaths, disease-specific outcomes, and immunizations merged with sociodemographic and other relevant variables."" This system would collect data at the national, state and local level, as well as from various academic institutions, labs and health care systems.

Additionally, they said, there should be a ""permanent public health implementation workforce"" to address ongoing problems and emergencies. This would include public agency workers and an increase in school nurses. They also called for creating pathways to increase telemedicine and the ability for doctors to practice and bill in different states.

Finally, they said it is imperative ""to rebuild trust in public health institutions and a belief in collective action in service of public health.""

CDC DOUBLES DOWN ON ISOLATION GUIDELINES AFTER CRITICISM, SAYS PEOPLE CAN TAKE A TEST IF THEY HAVE 'ACCESS'

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she had not read the articles, when asked on Thursday. But she insisted that Biden's goal is still to ""defeat the virus.""

""The president's focus and objective is to save as many lives as possible,"" Psaki said. ""And we know what works and we know that pushing more people, getting more people vaccinated, getting more people boosted, encouraging mask wearing, making sure schools have the resources they need to stay open and do that in a safe way – these are steps that work.""

An article from Emanuel, Michaels and Bright said the government's early response to the pandemic was ""seriously flawed,"" and that problems continue to exist.

""Early guidance on testing was mistargeted, getting tested was a logistical nightmare, and too few tests were performed,"" they wrote. ""Once an acceptable, yet suboptimal, testing infrastructure was established, it was marginalized, thought to be superfluous because of the vaccines. Even now, testing results are not reliably linked with sociodemographic data, vaccination status, or clinical outcomes; the availability of reliable rapid tests remains limited; and prices are too high.""

In order to get to a new normal, the doctors said the country needs to set up ""a comprehensive, permanently funded system for testing, surveillance, and mitigation measures that does not currently exist.""

A third article, from Borio, Emanuel, and Bright, focused on ""faster development and more efficient deployment of vaccines and therapeutics.""

In terms of vaccines, the doctors offered strong support for mandates, arguing that they ""have been shown to be effective, especially among individuals who are not fundamentally opposed to vaccination, but are procrastinating, confused, or have barriers to access."" They also claimed that mandates are needed in order to get 90% of the population vaccinated.

Supporting Biden's mandate approach, they said mandates for government employees and contractors, health care workers, and employees of businesses with at least 100 employees are ""necessary"" in order for enough people to be vaccinated ""to return to pre–COVID-19 life expectancy and social and economic vitality.""

That being said, they pushed for more work to be done to determine optimal dosages and administration of the existing vaccines.

2022-01-06 16:20:20+00:00,16,"CBS correspondent Vladimir Duthiers praised Australia following Novak Djokovic's apparent failed attempt to defend his Australian Open title after declining to provide his COVID-19 vaccination status, a saga which has gripped the sports world.

Djokovic's quest for back-to-back championships was questionable for months after the No. 1 player in the world declined to provide his vaccine status to the tournament. But a beaming Djokovic announced to his fans on Tuesday that he had been given a medical exemption from the vaccine requirement, and he would be heading down under after all.

It turned out to be a short-lived celebration. Just a day after Djokovic's smiling Instagram post, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison released a statement saying they had encountered a problem with the athlete's visa; it had been ""canceled"" and he would be sent home. Australian Border Forces released its own statement that Djokovic did not provide the ""appropriate evidence"" to meet the government’s entry requirements.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC DENIED ENTRY INTO AUSTRALIA AFTER VISA MISHAP, FACING DEPORTATION

Djokovic's fans were furious. But others, like CBS's Vladimir Duthiers, suggested Australian officials had done the right thing, and patted them on the back for such stringent measures.

""Australia has done very, very well in vaccines and in keeping people safe, so that's why they're doing it,"" Duthiers said on ""CBS Mornings,"" saying the federal government must have seen something that tennis Australia did not.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC’S ENTRY TO AUSTRALIA DELAYED OVER VIS MISHAP, BEING HELD IN GUARDED ROOM

Duthiers's colleague Gayle King, who noted Djokovic has never wanted to reveal either his vaccine status or the reasoning behind his medical exemption, said she was ""surprised"" Djokovic would ""even want to play"" at the tournament at all knowing ""there's this big controversy.""

Australia has had some of the strictest lockdowns in the world throughout the pandemic. The country's ""COVID zero"" policy in part prevented international arrivals, closed state borders, and enforced city and state-wide lockdowns, sometimes even after just one reported COVID-19 case.

Morrison eventually announced an end to the policy in August after saying it was not ""sustainable.""

Djokovic's situation has torn the tennis world. Tennys Sandgren, an American tennis player who is unvaccinated, defended him.

""Just to be crystal clear here, 2 separate medical boards approved his exemption And politicians are stopping it Australia doesn’t deserve to host a grand slam,"" Sandgren tweeted.

World No. 6 and fellow Grand Slam title winner Rafael Nadal, however, said rules are rules.

TOM HOMAN SOUNDS ALARM ON VACCINE MANDATES: ‘DEVASTATING TO OUR BORDER SECURITY’

The vaccine mandate for Border Patrol agents has proven controversial. The Biden administration announced in September that all federal workers must be fully vaccinated by Nov. 22 or face termination. A senior official at Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, recently said that ""counseling letters"" have been sent to employees who rejected getting the vaccine, which puts them ""on notice.""

""A counseling letter puts an employee on notice,"" the senior official told The Intercept last month . ""Counseling letters set the stage — management can say, ‘Hey, we told you [that] you are going to be subject to discipline for failing to follow instructions.’""

State Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly announced the one-month extension on Wednesday.

The extended mandate announcement comes just days after a report that suggested cloth masks are ineffective against the omicron variant of COVID-19.

CDC SPARKS OUTRAGE WITH 'CONFUSING' UPDATED COVID ISOLATION GUIDANCE: 'SERIOUSLY?'

""At that time, we will again re-evaluate the condition across California, our communities and our health-care delivery settings to make sure that we are taking the latest information into account to determine if there would be another extension, or if we're prepared to lift that requirement across the state,"" Ghaly said during a briefing. ""Omicron is here and it’s here now.""

The original mask mandate went into effect Dec. 15 and was slated to expire on Jan. 15. It requires the wearing of masks in all indoor spaces regardless of vaccination status.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles County reported more than 21,000 new COVID-19 cases. The county reported 45,000 new cases after the holiday weekend.

Those figures prompted the county court system to pause criminal jury trials for at least two weeks beginning Wednesday. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California also announced the immediate suspension of federal trials for at least three weeks because of the coronavirus.

Statewide, there were just over 8,000 hospitalizations for COVID-19, according to the Department of Public Health and Human Services.

Ghaly urged people to get vaccinated, obtain their booster shots and to wear better-fitting masks to combat omicron. He also said the mandate would not impact Super Bowl LVI, which is scheduled to be held in SoFi Stadium, in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood on Feb. 13.

The venue is home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers and has had a mask policy since October.

""The Super Bowl is coming to L.A.,"" he told FOX 11 Los Angeles.

The NFL told Fox News it still plans to hold its annual championship game in Los Angeles.

""As part of our standard contingency planning process that we conduct for all regular and postseason games, we have contacted several clubs to inquire about stadium availability in the event we cannot play the Super Bowl as scheduled due to weather-related issues or unforeseen circumstances,"" NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in a statement.

He added the league contacted the Dallas Cowboys club to inquire about the availability of the Cowboys Stadium as a backup venue for the Super Bowl. McCarthy also noted that the Rams will play in SoFi Stadium on Sunday where it will host 70,000-plus fans.

The extended mandate came on the same day a testing site in Los Angeles County confirmed the first known local case of ""flurona,"" a combination of the flu and the coronavirus.

The U.S. reported more than 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, setting a global record and almost doubling the previous record set last week. Hospitalizations have also skyrocketed across the country, but deaths have held relatively steady in recent weeks.

BIDEN'S 'PANDEMIC OF THE UNVACCINATED' NARRATIVE FALLS APART AS OMICRON CASES SKYROCKET

Biden gave a speech Tuesday maintaining his position that ""this continues to be a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" even though breakthrough cases of COVID-19 among people who are fully vaccinated continue to rise across the country as new variants emerge.

Biden said unvaccinated people ""have some reason to be alarmed"" about the omicron variant and some may ""needlessly die"" due to their continued refusal to get the shot.

""There is no excuse — no excuse for anyone being unvaccinated,"" he said.

The president's remarks came exactly six months after he gave an Independence Day speech on the White House South Lawn, saying ""we’ve gained the upper hand against this virus"" and that Americans could go back to living their lives.

""Two hundred and 45 years ago, we declared our independence from a distant king,"" he said. ""Today, we’re closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.""

Biden acknowledged at the time that there was still ""a lot more work to do"" and that more people needed to get vaccinated in order to claim victory against the virus.

""Thanks to our heroic vaccine effort, we’ve gained the upper hand against this virus. We can live our lives, our kids can go back to school, our economy is roaring back,"" he said, in part. ""So, today, while the virus hasn’t been vanquished, we know this: It no longer controls our lives. It no longer paralyzes our nation.""

Biden had tempered his remarks after failing to meet his vaccination goal of 70% of adult Americans vaccinated by July 4, 2021. Two months before his Independence Day speech, he wrote on Twitter, ""In two months, let’s celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus.""

Despite failing to meet its goal, the White House hosted a barbecue with essential workers and military families on the South Lawn on the Fourth of July. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at the time that the event was being held so ""friends and family can gather together to celebrate our independence from the virus.""

During his speech on July 4, the CDC was reporting that 67% of the adult population had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and about 47% had received both doses. Now, about 74% have received their first dose, up seven percentage points, and about 62% have taken their second dose, up 15 percentage points, according to the CDC.

But the coronavirus is currently rampaging through the vaccinated population due to the high transmissibility of the omicron variant.

Biden admitted during Tuesday’s speech that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted ""can still get COVID-19"" but said it is ""highly unlikely"" that those individuals become ""seriously ill.""

The president appears to have corrected his messaging after falsely claiming for months that vaccinated people can’t spread COVID-19, despite his own CDC saying since at least last April that breakthrough infections can and do occur.

""How about making sure that you’re vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anyone else,"" the president said just last month.

Biden’s past comments about kids going back to school and the country not being paralyzed due to the virus have also not held up.

Biden suggested that vaccinations would ""protect"" people from getting the illness.

""Omicron is a very transmissible, transmissible variant, but much different than anything we've seen before,"" Biden said. ""You can protect yourself, and you should protect yourself, quite frankly. Get vaccinated, get boosted. There are plenty of booster shots. Wear a mask while you're in public.""

But the CDC noted on Dec. 20 that it ""expects that anyone with Omicron infection can spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated or don’t have symptoms.""

According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, ""The symptoms of breakthrough COVID-19 are similar to COVID-19 symptoms in unvaccinated people, but are generally milder,"" though the vaccines ""are very effective"" at preventing hospitalization and death.

Biden warned that those who are unvaccinated ""have some reason to be alarmed.""

""Many of you will, you know, you'll experience severe illness in many cases if you get COVID-19 if you are not vaccinated,"" Biden said. ""Some will die, needlessly die. Unvaccinated are taking up hospital beds and crowding emergency rooms and intensive care units.""

The president said there is ""concern and some considerable confusion"" about the rising cases of COVID-19 across the nation.

Biden said the COVID-19 testing situation in the United States is ""frustrating"" but maintained that his administration is ""making improvements"" by creating federal testing sites and making more at-home rapid tests available to the public.

Biden also said that the increased capacity for in-person testing will reduce lines and make more appointments available.

As for those looking to test at home, Biden said drug stores and online websites ""are re-stocking,"" saying more at-home tests will ""continue to become available.""

The president also announced that next week, insurance companies will begin reimbursing individuals for at-home rapid tests.

""If you're insured, you can buy the test and get paid for it,"" Biden said, adding that many states and local governments are ""passing out free at-home tests that you can pick up.""

""Just find out where they are,"" Biden said.

COVID-19 TREATMENT PILLS: WHEN ARE WHERE WILL THEY BE AVAILABLE?

The president also added that the federal government is launching a website in January where individuals can go and request tests to be shipped to their homes for free.

During his remarks, Biden also announced that he had directed health officials to double the U.S. government's purchase of Pfizer's antiviral COVID-19 pill from 10 million to 20 million treatment courses and planned to accelerate the delivery of those treatments.

The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Pfizer's Paxlovid-nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets last month – the first oral antiviral treatments for COVID-19.

The Biden administration in November had announced a commitment to securing 10 million treatment courses of Pfizer's Paxlovid oral antiviral drug, contingent on the FDA's emergency use authorization. The administration paid $5.295 billion for the first 10 million courses.

It took only about a month for the new variant to displace delta, as the first case of omicron was detected in the United States on Dec. 1 and it was responsible for just 0.6% of new cases for the week that ended Dec. 4.

Omicron was responsible for 8% of cases by Dec. 11, 37.9% of cases by Dec. 18, and 77% of cases by Dec. 25.

Delta is still dominant in parts of New England and the Plains, but omicron is dominant everywhere else, according to CDC data.

The rise of omicron has coincided with a record surge in new COVID-19 cases, as the seven-day average for new cases stood at 316,277 on Dec. 29.

The United States reported 1,082,549 new cases on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University, but that number may be elevated due to a backlog of cases over the holidays and weekend.

Multiple studies have shown that omicron's rapid spread may be due to the variant's ability to evade immunity offered by both vaccines and previous infection.

While it may be spreading faster than previous variants, omicron has been associated with milder disease.

A study conducted by Discovery Health in South Africa, where omicron was first identified, found that hospital admissions for adults with the new variant were 29% lower than for those with delta.

COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE UNCERTAINTY AS SCHOOLS GO REMOTE, DELAY RETURN TO CAMPUS

Researchers at the LKS Faculty of Medicine at The University of Hong Kong found that omicron replicates 70 times faster than delta in the human bronchus, but 10 times slower in lung tissue, which may explain why it spreads more rapidly but is responsible for less severe disease.

Vaccines are still effective against illness from omicron, according to a University of Copenhagen study that found a booster shot offered 86% protection against symptoms and 98% protection against severe disease.

All of this comes after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use for children ages 12 to 15, shortened the period for booster shot eligibility to ""at least five months,"" and said it would allow a third primary series dose of the Pfizer vaccine for ""certain immunocompromised children 5 through 11 years of age.""

""Peer-reviewed data from multiple laboratories indicate that a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine greatly improves an individual’s antibody response to be able to counter the omicron variant,"" the FDA wrote. ""Authorizing booster vaccination to take place at five months rather than six months may therefore provide better protection sooner for individuals against the highly transmissible omicron variant.""

Boosters are already recommended for everyone 16 years of age and older.

2022-01-04 16:50:00+00:00,26,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Monday that the interval between a second dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine and a booster shot remains six months.

""Right now if you got J&J, you get a booster after two months. If you got Pfizer as your primary series, you can get a booster at five months or beyond. If you got Moderna, you can get a booster at six months or beyond. Whatever you decide to get a booster of,"" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a call with reporters.

""So, for right now, safe action pertains to the Pfizer vaccine. The boosters for Moderna remain unchanged, for the moment, at six months,"" Dr. Peter Marks, the director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, added.

FDA APPROVES PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BOOSTERS FOR CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 12

Their comments come after the FDA's move to authorize a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in children ages 12 to 15 and its decision to shorten the period for booster shot eligibility to ""at least five months.""

In addition, the agency said it would allow a third primary series dose of the Pfizer vaccine for ""certain immunocompromised children 5 through 11 years of age.""

""Throughout the pandemic, as the virus that causes COVID-19 has continuously evolved, the need for the FDA to quickly adapt has meant using the best available science to make informed decisions with the health and safety of the American public in mind,"" Woodcock said in a statement announcing the updates. ""With the current wave of the omicron variant, it’s critical that we continue to take effective, life-saving preventative measures such as primary vaccination and boosters, mask wearing and social distancing in order to effectively fight COVID-19.""

The FDA said it ""determined that the protective health benefits of a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to provide continued protection against COVID-19 and the associated serious consequences that can occur including hospitalization and death, outweigh the potential risks in individuals 12 through 15 years of age.""

""Additionally, peer-reviewed data from multiple laboratories indicate that a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine greatly improves an individual’s antibody response to be able to counter the omicron variant,"" the FDA wrote. ""Authorizing booster vaccination to take place at five months rather than six months may therefore provide better protection sooner for individuals against the highly transmissible omicron variant.""

PHYSICIAN WRITES THAT COVID-19 TESTS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM MOST

The chief safety concern for younger teenagers is a rare side effect called myocarditis: a type of heart inflammation seen mostly in younger men and teen boys who get either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. The vast majority of cases are mild and far milder than the heart inflammation caused by the coronavirus.

The agency noted that it continues to review data concerning all available vaccines and would ""provide additional updates as appropriate.""

A panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to decide later this week whether to recommend boosters to the younger teens, including a final decision by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

Boosters are already recommended for everyone 16 years of age and older.

While vaccines still offer protection against serious illness from COVID-19, officials are urging everyone who is eligible to receive a booster shot amidst a surge of the omicron variant.

Child hospitalizations are rising due to the variant of concern, and most of the patients are unvaccinated.

As cases continue to rise nationwide, thousands of flights have been canceled as an increased number of airline workers have tested positive, and other Americans have been waiting hours at testing sites.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently cut down the recommended isolation time for those who test positive but show no symptoms from 10 days to just five – though it’s unclear if the agency will amend its advice to recommend a negative test for those wishing to leave quarantine early. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week that a PCR test after infection can be positive for up to 12 weeks.

As schools are looking to resume after holiday breaks, testing woes could further impact students' and teachers’ return. And omicron's effect is being felt across other industries as more workers call out sick.

""The Governor and First Lady tested themselves due to a recent known non-family contact in their home. Required procedures for reporting, case investigation, and contact tracing have been followed,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office said in a statement Sunday.

Murphy and the couple's four children all tested negative but will continue to be tested in the coming days, according to reporting from North Jersey.com.

The Democratic governor and his wife are both vaccinated, and Murphy will continue with a normal schedule but will wear a mask at public events.

The positive test comes after Murphy faced criticism for a holiday vacation to Costa Rica despite the emergence and spread of the omicron variant in recent weeks, with the seven-day rolling average of cases in New Jersey reaching over 14,000 before he departed on his trip Dec. 22.

Asked last week if he believed the trip was appropriate given the surge in cases in his state, Murphy said his family needed the time together.

""We’re going to spend some time together as a family,"" Murphy said. ""Please God, we need that.""

Murphy has become one of the country's most controversial governors throughout the pandemic, with his heavy-handed restrictions ranking among the most strict.

New York set a record of 85,476 cases on Saturday, breaking the state's record set just days earlier. The surge in cases came amid high numbers of testing.

Florida recorded 75,900 cases on Dec. 31, marking the fourth time in seven days that Florida has broken its record, which has raised the 7-day average to 42,600 - twice as much as this past summer’s surge thanks to the delta variant.

OMICRON VARIANT MAY IMPACT LUNGS DIFFERENTLY, STUDIES SAY

Florida usually only reports numbers on a Friday, but it feeds daily numbers to the CDC, which is where the new numbers came from. The Florida Department of Health will remain closed throughout the New Year’s holiday weekend, meaning new numbers will not be available until the following week, WFLA reported.

OMICRON LOOKS TO BRING IN NEW YEAR WITH HIGHEST CASELOADS RECORDED YET

The omicron variant has driven the new surge as it has in most parts of the country, resulting in a desperate need for testing. Florida residents have formed long lines in many areas, with wait times so long that at least three people have collapsed while standing in line.

Three people waiting at the Al Lopez Park testing site collapsed Friday, requiring immediate medical attention. One person left before the medics arrived, and the other two were women in their 60s – both with a history of blood pressure issues.

2022-01-01 22:22:48+00:00,108,"A Virginia teachers union has faced ridicule online after it sent a letter riddled with grammatical and typographical errors. The union president explained that the union mistakenly published a draft, rather than the completed letter.

""On behalf of the members of the Arlington Education Association, this dire expression lends great concerns for Arlington Public Schools (APS) return plan for January 3rd, 2022,"" begins the letter, which Arlington Education Association (AEA) President Ingrid Gant sent to Arlington Public Schools Superintendent Francisco Duran on Dec. 30, 2021. The letter raised concerns about the omicron variant of the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, a more contagious variant that has spread rapidly throughout the U.S.

VIRGINIA SCHOOL DISTRICT ‘INDOCTRINATING’ KIDS WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY, PARENTS CLAIM IN LAWSUIT

Ellen Gallery, a homeschooling mother of three who lives in the area, claimed that she and her kids had gone through the letter, correcting mistakes. She and her kids marked what they identified as eight errors in that one opening sentence.

The mother posted a picture of the letter with copious corrections, faulting AEA for leaving out words, adding unnecessary commas, confusing subject-verb agreement, and more.

One offending pair of sentences read, ""The fire departments in are region are exemplifying domino outbreaks as well. APS employees are no different or above this trend, yet leadership prepares to send educators into situations that will make them sick."" In the first sentence, Gant used ""are"" when she clearly meant to write ""our."" Gallery and her kids suggested ""neither different nor above"" for the second sentence.

""The next few weeks are going to be very challenging and without the testing capacity and necessary mitigations, it will be dangerous,"" Gant wrote in another sentence. Gallery corrected ""it"" to ""they,"" since the pronoun appears to refer to ""the next few weeks.""

""Being able to write a clear, persuasive letter is a fundamental skill all students should master before high school,"" Gallery told Fox News. ""The quality of this writing was so glaringly terrible that it distracts from the writer's message.""

On Saturday, the Virginia Education Association – the teachers union of which AEA is a part – sent Fox News a statement from Gant explaining the errors.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has persisted far longer than any of us in the Arlington community had expected,"" the teachers union president wrote in the statement. ""A draft letter was sent in place of a fully edited one in a rush to address the latest challenge. While I personally take full responsibility for this mistake, errors in my letter should in no way distract from its message: Arlington's students and educators are returning to school Monday without sufficient testing supplies and with a lunch plan that fails to address the increased risks associated with the Omicron variant.""

Gallery told Fox News that the AEA's COVID-19 concerns ""should have been discussed months ago, not days before kids are supposed to go back to school. Virginia has been allocated billions of taxpayer dollars to make the needed changes to allow in-person learning. We've known about Omicron for more than two months. As a homeschooling mom, I know my kids are profoundly fortunate that they haven't missed a single day of education due to covid or covid policies.""

""As a taxpayer, a voter, and someone who believes that a good education is an indispensable foundation for a fulfilling life, I'm heartbroken for the students in Arlington,"" Gallery added. ""All kids deserve effective, competent, in-person education. This letter does not inspire confidence that the leadership of the Arlington Education Association is on their side.""

Corey DeAngelis, national director of research at the American Federation for Children, praised the Gallerys' response to the letter as ""epic.""

""But the bigger issue is that the teachers union is signaling support for closing schools once again,"" he warned. ""They want all students and staff tested before reopening schools, but that's not the norm for any other businesses, and the added barrier could have practical issues in terms of logistics and testing supply.""

""Enough is enough,"" DeAngelis added. ""It's time to free families from the clutches of the teachers unions once and for all. Virginia public schools spend over $13,000 per student per year. That money should go directly to families so they can find alternatives. Many Virginia families felt powerless last school year. Funding students directly would ensure families never have to feel powerless when it comes to their children's education ever again.""",FoxNews,"['union', 'covid19', 'arlington', 'students', 'virginia', 'kids', 'mocked', 'teachers', 'education', 'schools', 'grammatical', 'letter', 'errors', 'school']",0
