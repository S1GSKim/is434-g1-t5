2021-02-25 05:27:14+00:00,23,"A new COVID-19 variant spreading through New York City has mutations that may weaken the effectiveness of vaccines, according to two new studies.

The B.1.526 variant, which first appeared in samples collected in New York City in November, now makes up about 27 percent of viral sequences deposited into a database shared by scientists called GISAID, according to The New York Times.

One of the studies was led by a group at California Institute of Technology and published online on Tuesday. The other cited by the Times was conducted by researchers at Columbia University but has not yet been made public.

Neither study has been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal, the outlet noted, but experts not involved with either study called the results worrying.

New York City, which was the epicenter of the pandemic last spring, has recorded 707,695 COVID-19 cases, and 29,025 people have died from the virus.

New cases and daily deaths in the city are decreasing, with 24,558 people testing positive and 384 fatalities in the past seven days. The city's test positivity rate is 8.06%.

Caltech researchers told the New York Times they found two versions of coronavirus rising rapidly in the city. They are calling both the B.1.526 variant for now.

One carries the E484K mutation, which has independently been found in Brazil and South Africa. Scientists believe that mutation reduces the effectiveness of vaccines.

The other has the S477N mutation which may act like a guide for COVID-19 to human cells, optimizing the binding process and possibly increasing infection rates.

The Caltech researchers discovered B.1.526's rise by scanning a database for mutations in hundreds of thousands of viral genetic sequences.

'There was a pattern that was recurring, and a group of isolates concentrated in the New York region that I hadn't seen,' Anthony West, a computational biologist at Caltech. told the Times.

Columbia University researchers identified the variant with a different method: by analyzing the genetic sequences of 1,142 samples from patients at their medical center.

In their study, researchers identified that 12 percent of the patients at their center had been infected with the variant containing the E484K mutation.

Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, said cases carrying the mutation were dispersed throughout the metropolitan area - but most were in nearby Manhattan neighborhoods like Washington Heights and Inwood.

'We see cases in Westchester, in the Bronx and Queens, the lower part of Manhattan and in Brooklyn,' Dr. Ho said.

'So it seems to be widespread. It's not a single outbreak.'

Ho's team also found six cases of the Britain's B.1.1.7 variant - as well as two infections with Brazil's P1 and one with South Africa's B.1.351 variant, neither of which had not previously been reported in New York City.

Britain's B.1.1.7 variant is expected to become the most prevalent form of the coronavirus in the United States by the end of March, according to the Times, and now accounts for about 2,000 cases in 45 states.

Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, was not involved in the new research efforts but called the B.1.526 variant 'one to watch.'

'Given the involvement of E484K or S477N, combined with the fact that the New York region has a lot of standing immunity from the spring wave, this is definitely one to watch,' Andersen told the Times.

Michel Nussenzweig, a Rockefeller University immunologist who was not involved in either study. said: 'It's not particularly happy news.'

'But just knowing about it is good because then we can perhaps do something about it,' he said.

Nussenzweig added that he is more worried about the variant in New York than the one quickly spreading in California because the E484K mutation interferes the antibodies from vaccines and treatments nearly everyone makes.",MailOnline,"['cases', 'researchers', 'study', 'according', 'variant', 'york', 'spreading', 'city', 'weaken', 'effect', 'covid19', 'vaccines', 'mutation', 'e484k']",0

Research carried out by De Montfort University (DMU) in Leicester looked at how a coronavirus behaves on three fabrics commonly used in the healthcare industry.

Polyester enables the virus to survive at infectious levels for up to 72 hours, whereas it dies within 24 hours on 100 per cent cotton.

However, coronaviruses can only survive on a polycotton hybrid however for six hours, the study found.

The study used a model coronavirus called HCoV-OC43 which is very similar to SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.

Droplets were added to polyester, polycotton and cotton to see how long the virus lasted on these surfaces.

The findings are concerning, the researchers say, because if live virus sticks to the clothing of healthcare professionals then it could be carried from the hospital and into the home of staff and rub off onto various surfaces, allowing it to spread.

Microbiologist Dr Katie Laird, who led the study, has advised the Government that all healthcare uniforms should be laundered in hospitals to commercial standards or by an industrial laundry.

Dr Laird, head of the Infectious Disease Research Group at DMU, said: 'When the pandemic first started there was very little understanding of how long coronavirus could survive on textiles.

'Our findings show that three of the most commonly used textiles in healthcare pose a risk for transmission of the virus.

'If nurses and healthcare workers take their uniforms home, they could be leaving traces of the virus on other surfaces.'

Researchers from the University of Quebec studied 813 healthcare workers who contracted Covid-19.

Public Health England (PHE) published guidance in 2020 that the uniforms of healthcare workers should be laundered to industrial standards.

However, there is an exception for this if it is deemed to not be possible.

The NHS says a home wash of at least 60°C is fine and able to get rid of pathogens.

However, Dr Laird warns this NHS guidance is based on 14-year-old evidence and is in need of urgent review.

The researchers put the NHS advice to the test on 100 per cent cotton, the most common textile used in a healthcare environment.

What is anosmia? Anosmia is the medical name for a condition in which someone suffers a complete or partial loss of their sense of smell. The most common single cause of the condition – temporary or permanent – is illnesses which affect the nose or sinuses, such as polyps which grow in the airways, fractured bones or cartilage, hay fever or tumours. It is different to hyposmia, which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells. Around 3.5 million people in the UK are affected by the condition, along with nearly 10 million in the US. It is surprisingly common and affects between three and five per cent of people. Head injuries and nervous system diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's may also contribute to the condition by damaging nerves in the nose which are responsible for detecting smells.

Participants in the study all filled in questionnaires and completed home tests to evaluate their sense of taste and smell.

These were done, on average, five months after they caught Covid-19 and therefore the researchers are unable to say whether or not anosmia endures for longer than this, as the data does not yet exist.

'While COVID-19 is a new disease, previous research shows that most people lose their sense of smell and taste in early stages of the illness,' said study author Dr Johannes Frasnelli.

'We wanted to go further and look at how long that loss of smell and taste lingers, and how severe it is in people with COVID-19.'

People graded their sense of smell and taste on a scale of 0 to 10, with zero being no sense at all and 10 meaning a strong sense.

The average score for people recovering from Covid was an eight, whereas it was a nine for people before they got sick.

Of the 813 participants, 527 lost their sense of taste during the initial illness.

Thirty-eight per cent (200 people) of these had not regained their sense of taste five months later.

'Our results show that an impaired sense of smell and taste may persist in a number of people with COVID-19,' Dr Frasnelli said.

'This emphasises the importance of following up with people who have been infected, and the need for further research to discover the extent of neurological problems associated with COVID-19.'

The study has not yet been peer-reviewed and will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 73rd Annual Meeting between April 17 and 22.

Loss of smell and taste was officially recognised as a symptom of Covid on May 18, 2020, and since then has become an integral part of the diagnostic process as the NHS says the only three tell-tale signs of the illness are a fever, cough or loss of taste and smell.

Researchers from King's College London (KCL) recently called for policymakers to extend this set of recognised symptoms.

Researchers from the University of Quebec studied 813 healthcare workers who contracted Covid-19. More than a third (38 per cent) of those who lost their senses had not fully regained their taste after five months (stock)

Symptom prevalence among ill Covid-19 patients Cough - 29.40% Fatigue weakness - 28.11% Headache - 27.78% Muscle ache myalgia - 22.02% Fever - 18.92% Sore throat - 18.61% Loss of taste - 17.14% Loss of smell - 16.23% Shortness of breath - 10.48% Nausea vomiting - 8.79% Diarrhoea - 6.03% Abdominal pain - 5.91% Advertisement

They say adding fatigue, sore throat, headache and diarrhoea would allow 'millions' of unconfirmed cases to be detected.

Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty is already under pressure to change the official list of Covid symptoms after results from a government-led study, REACT, revealed thousands of infected people are slipping through the cracks due to the narrow guidance.

The World Health Organization and officials in the US recognise other less common symptoms such as muscle pain and diarrhoea.

But current Test and Trace rules mean swabs in the UK are only reserved for people with a fever, continuous cough or loss of smell or taste.

Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the Zoe app and an epidemiologist at King's College London, said: 'We've known since the beginning that just focusing testing on the classic triad of cough, fever and anosmia misses a significant proportion of positive cases.

'We identified anosmia as a symptom back in May and our work led to the Government adding it to the list; it is now clear that we need to add more.

'By inviting any users who log any new symptoms to get a test, we confirmed that there are many more symptoms of Covid.'

A group of 140 family doctors in London echoed this sentiment and called on health chiefs to expand the number of recognised symptoms.

They say many patients with milder signs have not even considered they could have the virus and have not self-isolated when they are most infectious.

The doctors add they must encourage patients to lie in order to get a test, which are only available to those with the three recognised symptoms.

Expanding the scheme to include runny noses in the depth of winter would likely pile immense pressure on the UK's Test and Trace system.

2021-02-22 19:15:12+00:00,10,"The World Health Organisation has blasted wealthy countries for hogging Covid vaccines days after the World Trade Organisation chief called on the UK to send jabs abroad.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said some rich countries' direct deals with manufacturers has caused a reduction in doses for poorer countries.

The chief said the money was there to procure doses for some of the poorest countries, following fresh contributions from the US, the European Union and Germany - but it was worthless if there was nothing to buy.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (pictured) has blasted wealthy countries for hogging Covid vaccines

Tedros urged wealthy nations to start checking first as to whether their own deals with pharmaceutical companies were undermining Covax, the global vaccine scheme which poorer countries are relying on as they await their first doses.

'Even if you have the money, if you cannot use the money to buy vaccines, having the money doesn't mean anything,' he told a virtual press conference with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The ONE Campaign, a global organisation co-founded by U2 singer Bono, said last week that members of the Group of Seven top industrialised nations along with the rest of the EU plus Australia had collectively bought nearly 1.25billion more doses than they needed to inoculate every member of their populations against Covid-19.

'Some high-income countries are actually approaching manufacturers to secure more vaccines, which is affecting the deals with Covax - and even the amount that was allocated for Covax was reduced because of this,' Tedros said.

WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (pictured) says the UK and other wealthy nations should send Covid vaccines to poorer countries now rather than wait for a surplus

'We can only have vaccines delivered to the countries who are members of Covax if the high-income countries cooperate in respecting the deals that Covax did.'

The first wave of Covax vaccines are to be shipped out between late February and the end of June.

Some 145 participating economies are set to receive 337million doses - enough to vaccinate a little over three percent of their combined populations.

Covax has said it hopes to raise the figure to up to 27 per cent in lower-income countries by the end of December.

It comes after the new WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it was 'in the interest' of richer countries like the UK to donate vaccines to poorer countries now.

Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU have purchased more than 3billion doses of the vaccine. This leaves a surplus of 1.2billion

The new director-general is both the first African and the first female to occupy the role and is keen to make an early impression.

Ms Okonjo-Iweala told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK's plan to donate its surplus vaccines to the developing world was welcomed but needs to be accelerated.

She said: 'I don't think we should wait to get surplus when other people have been served.

'I think that any donations that are coming must come now.

'The reason is very simple. It's in the interest of rich countries as well as poor countries to have equitable access.'

She cited a study by the International Chamber of Commerce that outlines the case for global vaccinations.

The study claimed the world could lose £6.4trillion ($9trillion) if richer countries have vaccinated half their populations and poor countries have not vaccinated theirs by the middle of the year.

Boris Johnson (pictured at the virtual meeting of G7 leaders) told global leaders there is 'no point' in vaccinating national populations if efforts are not made to ensure the 'whole world' receives jabs

Boris Johnson appears to agree, telling G7 leaders there is 'no point' in vaccinating national populations if efforts are not made to ensure the 'whole world' receives jabs.

The world's biggest vaccine maker, India's Serum Institute, on Monday urged other countries to be 'patient' about it supplying anti-coronavirus shots, saying it has been instructed to prioritise its home market.

Steinmeier said that although countries were focused on protecting their own citizens from coronavirus, it made sense for the wealthier nations speeding ahead in the vaccine race to ensure that people in poorer nations were jabbed at the same time.

'Governments are first and foremost - and understandably so - committed to their respective publics,' he said.

However, 'if we refuse to grant the necessary solidarity, we must not be surprised if other countries come in to fill this vacuum by delivering earlier what is required - and using that that for their own purposes.'

Tedros called for intellectual property rights on Covid-19 medical goods to be waived - a move which could facilitate greater knowledge-sharing and the rapid scale-up of production sites.

The idea, currently before the World Trade Organisation, is staunchly opposed by pharmaceutical giants.

Tedros also urged pharmaceutical companies that were not making their own Covid-19 vaccines to turn over their facilities to produce other companies' doses, as Sanofi has done for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.

'If we increase the pie, then better opportunities to share it equitably too.'

Steinmeier however said he did not think a waiver for patents or licensing 'would be the right approach'.",MailOnline,"['countries', 'uk', 'wealthy', 'hoarding', 'slams', 'doses', 'covax', 'nations', 'vaccine', 'rich', 'covid19', 'world', 'vaccines', 'poorer']",0

You may exercise on your own, with one other person, or with your household or support bubble.

You should not meet other people you do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, unless for a permitted reason.

Stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household. Detailed guidance on the national lockdown: You must not leave or be outside of your home except where you have a 'reasonable excuse'. This will be put in law. The police can take action against you if you leave home without a 'reasonable excuse', and issue you with a fine (Fixed Penalty Notice). You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400. A 'reasonable excuse' includes: Work - you can only leave home for work purposes where it is unreasonable for you to do your job from home

Volunteering - you can also leave home to provide voluntary or charitable services

Essential activities - you can leave home to buy things at shops or obtain services. You may also leave your home to do these things on behalf of a disabled or vulnerable person or someone self-isolating

Education and childcare - you can only leave home for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children where they are eligible to attend.

Meeting others and care - you can leave home to visit people in your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one), to provide informal childcare for children under 14 as part of a childcare bubble (for example, to enable parents to work), to provide care for disabled or vulnerable people

Exercise - you can continue to exercise alone, with one other person or with your household or support bubble, limited to once per day, and not outside your local area

Medical reasons - you can leave home for a medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and emergencies

Harm and compassionate visits - you can leave home to be with someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse).

You can also leave home to visit someone who is dying or someone in a care home (if permitted under care home guidance), hospice, or hospital, or to accompany them to a medical appointment

Animal welfare reasons – you can leave home for animal welfare reasons, such as to attend veterinary services for advice or treatment

Communal worship and life events - You can leave home to attend or visit a place of worship for communal worship, a funeral or event related to a death, a burial ground or a remembrance garden, or to attend a wedding ceremony. There are further reasonable excuses. For example, you may leave home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or where it is reasonably necessary for voting in an election or referendum.

The risk of becoming infected with Covid while socialising outdoors is 'much, much lower' than doing the same indoors, say leading scientists.

Even the slightest breeze will radically cut the chance of receiving an infectious dose from a nearby diner, as the air movement will prevent build-up of Sars-Cov-2 particles.

What's more, the paucity of infections believed to have taken place outside adds to the fact the infection risk in open air is likely to be very low indeed, they say.

But transmission could still occur if people are sitting at the same outside table, they caution.

Explaining why infection risks are far lower outdoors than in, ventilation expert Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University, said: 'The biggest factor is the much, much lower level of concentration of virus particles that you would be subjected to in an outdoor setting.

'Fresh air effectively carries the virus away.'

This dilution makes 'a huge difference as evidence shows people are able to fend off infection if they are exposed to a low dose'.

But Dr Fitzgerald stressed the importance of keeping a distance in face-to-face outdoor settings to avoid larger droplets.

It comes as hoards of lockdown-weary revellers didn't appear to be worried about the rules as they flocked to the great outdoors on the first weekend of fine weather since England's third dreary shutdown began last month.

Current restrictions forbid meeting other people you do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, unless for a permitted reason.

Any outdoor gatherings must be limited to between just two people from two households, yet crowds of sunseekers took to beaches and green spaces across the country on Saturday, just days ahead of Boris Johnson's 'roadmap' to freedom announcement.

No 10 insisted yesterday that increasing social contact for families was an 'absolute priority' in easing lockdown, with many having now gone several weeks without seeing loved ones since the restrictions were ramped up at the start of January.

In a positive boost for the PM's highly-anticipated plans for life after lockdown, figures show Britain's second Covid wave is continuing to shrink as a further 445 people died after testing positive - down 28 per cent on last Saturday.

And yesterday's daily case total has dropped too, with 10,406 people testing positive. The figure is 21.8 per cent lower than the 13,308 seen on this day last week and is the lowest week-on-week Saturday rise since the end of September.

Under Mr Johnson's plan - set to be announced on Monday - pubs will be given the green light to serve people outdoors from April, while two households of any size will be allowed to meet outside.

Current rules ban picnics and outdoor gatherings - with Britons ordered to stay indoors for all but essential reasons, such as Government-mandated daily exercise.

Ministers are keen to focus on the outdoors when relaxing social contact rules, as virus transmission is deemed less of a risk.

But revellers appeared to be unable to wait for the imminent rule change, with coat-clad crowds soaking up the sun as the mercury started to creep up this morning.

Countless Britons gathered in Victoria Park, Wimbledon and Primrose Hill in London to enjoy the mild weather on Saturday - with many stopping for breaks on benches and grassy areas.

Adding to the pull to the great outdoors was the promise of skyrocketing temperatures, with highs of 63F (17C) predicted - and the potential to hit the 64F (18C) mark in some regions.

Warm weather will be a welcome break for those still recovering from the 'dangerous' blizzards and sub-zero temperatures brought by the 'Baltic Beast' - or Beast from the East II - earlier this month.

A 16-year-old with no known underlying health conditions was among those who died after testing positive for Covid in England, Saturday's figures show.

Official statistics revealed another 307 people who tested positive for coronavirus died in hospital in England, aged between 16 and 100. All except four - aged between 16 and 68 - had known underlying health conditions.

Scotland recorded a further 803 new cases of coronavirus, along with 29 new deaths. Wales recorded a further 363 positive tests and an additional 16 fatalities.

Yesterday's data also revealed the UK has hit a grand total of 17,852,327 jabs. Of these, 17,247,442 were first doses - a rise of 371,906 on the previous day - data up to February 19 showed.

Some 604,885 were second doses, an increase of 15,294 on figures released on Thursday.

The Prime Minister is poised to allow more social mixing within weeks, providing a light at the end of the tunnel for millions of grandparents isolated from their grandchildren.

Ministers are looking at the data and a final decision on when the restrictions will be eased will be taken at the weekend.

It is thought the new plan could replace the 'Rule of Six' as entire families, regardless of size, are expected to be allowed to meet up in outside spaces.

From April, two households would be able to meet outdoors while gatherings of six people from six different households would also be acceptable.

Relatives who live further away from each other may have to wait a little longer for a reunion, as the future rules on travelling longer distances are still unclear. And in the case of those who do meet up, the two-metre rule is expected to remain in place for months to come.

Welsh salons to reopen - but no luck for Brit barnets until April Hairdressers may be able to open within four weeks – at the same time as non-essential shops – in Wales. Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said: 'If it is possible from March 15 to begin the reopening of some aspects of non-essential retail and personal services such as hairdressing then ... that is what we would want to do.' Hairdressers and barbers had been expected to reopen weeks after shops. Mr Drakeford's comments to BBC Breakfast will likely put more pressure on Boris Johnson to do the same in England. He also announced on Friday that children aged between three and seven will return to schools from Monday, with further pupils joining by mid-March if conditions allow. Lockdown restrictions, which have been in place in Wales since December 20, will also be slightly eased to allow four people from two different households to exercise together. Advertisement

Mr Johnson is set to meet senior ministers tomorrow to hammer out the final details. The committee will examine the latest data on the impact of lockdown and the vaccine rollout, so they can decide how quickly to lift restrictions.

Cabinet will then rubber stamp the plans on Monday morning, before they are revealed to the Commons that afternoon.

The blueprint is likely to see schools return on March 8 along with more relaxed rules on outdoor exercise; the return of outdoor sports like golf and tennis at the end of next month and non-essential shops opening soon after Easter.

Pubs and restaurants may also be able to serve people outdoors from April – although not indoors until May.

Ahead of revealing his roadmap out of lockdown, Mr Johnson has also been urged to allow pubs to reopen as soon as possible.

Beer sales in pubs dropped by 56 per cent in 2020, a decrease of £7.8billion, due to Covid-19 restrictions and the lockdowns, according to British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) figures.

Emma McClarkin, BBPA chief executive, believes that pubs should reopen alongside non-essential retail once the most vulnerable in society have been vaccinated, as they have a community role.

She said: 'The Great British Pub has always been more than just a place to drink. It is where we go to connect. It is where we go to form community.'

There are also fears over workers being made homeless as tens of thousands of pubs are small family businesses which also double up as someone's home, the BBPA said.

Meanwhile, the co-founder of fast food chain Leon said this morning it is 'quite plausible' the company will not exist if the 'weeks and months drag on'.

John Vincent told Radio 4's Today Programme: 'About 235 businesses a week are going under. It's not being reported, it's not being understood.

'We served 1million meals as to the NHS, a million meals to frontline ITU teams.

'If we don't exist, which is quite plausible if the weeks and months drag on, we can't even do the basics of what we did to feed a million meals to frontline teams. 'Businesses are at the heart of a functioning, healthy society. I would say: Produce the analysis, inform yourself and take the whole picture into account for the good of society.'

It comes as the Government was last night forced to deny that Chris Whitty feels 'very unhappy' about plans for a 'big bang' reopening of schools on March 8.

Downing Street knocked down claims the chief medical officer has concerns a full return - rather than a staggered approach call for by unions - will cause a spike in infections.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made clear his ambition for all 10 million schoolchildren and staff to return on March 8. The children would be tested for coronavirus twice a week in an effort to control the spread of the virus.

But education sources told The Guardian Mr Whitty was 'very unhappy' with the plan. Some officials are concerned a mass return will both rise infection rates and pose problems with administering covid tests to pupils.

Both ministers and senior advisers want Mr Whitty to publicly back a full return, but he is said to be 'lukewarm'.

A Department for Education source last night branded the claim 'absolute b******t'. A government source also said the claim was 'categorically untrue'.

SAGE have modelled the impact of sending all children back to school at once, against a staggered year-by-year approach.

They believe that sending all children back to school at once will inevitably lead to a slightly bigger rise in the R value than only a smaller number of children.

However, Government scientists have stressed that it is up to ministers to weigh up these risks against the well-being of children.

Officials including Mr Whitty have repeatedly stressed the immense damage to children of staying at home target than being at school.

The ONS infection survey estimated 481,300 people in England would have tested positive for the virus on any given day in the week to February 12, a dip of 30 per cent compared to the same time last week

But separate data from the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app suggested cases have plateaued. It said there were 14,064 new infections a day in the UK in the second week of February, a drop of just five per cent compared to the last seven-day spell. Their app can only pick up symptomatic infections, and not those with no warning signs thought to account for at least a third of all cases

The ONS also showed Covid infections had dropped in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland compared to the previous week

And every region in England was also seeing infections continuing to fall in the week to February 12

Infections are now lowest among those aged over 70. But it is not clear whether this is due to the vaccine, with scientists saying they are only starting to see early signs of the jabs 'doing their job' in some areas

Public Health England data published revealed Covid cases had plunged in all but two regions of England in the second week of February. They only rose in Tameside, Greater Manchester, and North East Lincolnshire

The slow opening is likely to anger hospitality chiefs who have demanded an accelerated lifting of restrictions, given the success of the vaccine rollout. It is as yet unclear when domestic staycations or travel around Britain will be allowed to resume.

Co-founder of fast food chain Leon: 'It is quite plausible we won't exist if the weeks and months drag on' The co-founder of fast food chain Leon said this morning that the company is losing around £200,000 every week 'of cash going out the bank' and warned that it is 'quite plausible' the company will not exist if the 'weeks and months drag on'.

However, the First Minister of Wales raised the prospect that these could be possible as soon as Easter yesterday, saying that self-catering accommodation could be re-opened in the principality.

Mark Drakeford said allowing people to rent out self-contained accommodation would be a big boost to the tourism industry.

He said that following a meeting with tourism bosses yesterday, he was hoping to relax some measures 'around the Easter period'.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The most that we would be doing would be the reopening of self-contained accommodation where there aren't shared facilities and there isn't social mixing.

'But if we could do that – and six weeks is a very long time in this business – if we could do that in six weeks' time, I know that would be a boost to the industry and a big boost to hundreds of thousands of families in Wales for whom going down [to] the caravan for a few days for a break would be a very welcome prospect.'

Meanwhile there are also indications that Britons may yet be able to go on foreign holidays this summer. The Government is considering internationally recognised vaccination passports that will allow people to travel and is in talks with holiday destinations such as Greece about how they will work.

The roadmap is not expected to include a timeline for easing restrictions on holidays.

One Government source said: 'It's looking increasingly positive on summer holidays. Once the vaccination passport system is set up it should be straightforward. That won't be easy, but we can see the way ahead.'

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said no firm decisions had been taken but 'we will speak to international partners about what they may require and respect that'.

He told the BBC: 'It would be wrong for me to start speculating now. We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that.'

Haris Theoharis, the Greek tourism minister, said that vaccination passports and mass testing could allow for a 'semi-normal summer'.

The aviation industry are expecting a task force to be announced to come up with a plan for when international travel could be re-started. An industry source said: 'I think that provides the Government the ability to say we've heard aviation, while telling the public, we're not moving too fast here.

'What's frustrating for us is we've been trying to do our part to support the Government but we've been getting very little support back.'",MailOnline,"['support', 'outdoors', 'minister', 'getting', 'leave', 'infected', 'socialising', 'week', 'positive', 'lower', 'covid19', 'restrictions', 'pictured', 'going', 'weeks', 'risk']",0
2021-02-22 00:13:14+00:00,10,"Scientists have criticised the slow pace of China's investigation into the origins of Covid-19 as 'implausible', as reports claim that the 'patient zero' was not properly contact traced.

A World Health Organisation report is set to recommend extensive contact tracing of the first known patient in Wuhan, China, as well as the supply chain of traders in the city's Huanan seafood market.

The 'wet' market - where exotic live animals were traded - is believed to have played a key role in the early spread of the virus in late 2019.

But independent scientists have said they can't understand why Chinese scientists had not done the recommended investigative work months ago.

Scientists have criticised the slow pace of China's investigation into the origins of Covid-19 as 'implausible', as reports claim that the 'patient zero' was not properly contact traced

Professor Maureen Miller, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, said: 'It's implausible that this research has not been done. It's not realistic, given they have world-class scientists there, and the technology invested in over the last 20 years.

Miller, who was shown a copy of the to-be-published report by CNN, said the first patient's infection on December 8 without direct contact with the wet market or travel shows there was already community transmission.

'In the short and long term, it is detrimental to China to try to hide the fact that this virus started in China and was exported around the world,' she told the website.

Professor Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it was surprising China 'hasn't invested in investigating two important clues like that.'

A team of 10 WHO scientists travelled to Wuhan in January - over a year after the first infection - to carry out an independent investigation of the virus' origins

He added the country had recently mobilised the entire city of Beijing to find the source of a Covid-19 outbreak.

'They have top-notch scientists, who are much more knowledgeable than most in terms of recognising the importance of this information,' he said.

Huang added that the WHO recommendations showed they were 'uncovering some interesting information tracing of the origins of the virus.'

A team of 10 WHO scientists travelled to Wuhan in January - over a year after the first infection - to carry out an independent investigation of the virus' origins.

But unable to provide any significant findings, the group's trip was criticised as a 'charade', and US officials in the Trump administration accused China of trying to hide information from them.

WHO scientists have since said they were unable to rule out that the virus had escaped from a lab, or that the first infection came from inside China.

Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told reporters that an independent report on the coronavirus' origins 'doesn't mean bowing to the Western approach towards China based on presumption of guilt'

However they have managed to discover several signs that there was a much wider outbreak in December 2019 than was reported earlier.

The leader of the WHO mission, Peter Ben Embarek, declined to comment on the details of any further contact tracing or testing that could be recommended. He told CNN: 'Further studies are needed.'

On February 18, Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told reporters that an independent report on the coronavirus' origins 'doesn't mean bowing to the Western approach towards China based on presumption of guilt.'

Chunying added: 'China has conducted a very thorough, professional, science-based study with the WHO experts,' and insisted the WHO panel was satisfied with China's cooperation.

2021-02-21 23:30:04+00:00,10,"Rules on leaving the house in lockdown You cannot leave your home to meet socially with anyone you do not live with or are not in a support bubble with (if you are legally permitted to form one).

You may exercise on your own, with one other person, or with your household or support bubble.

You should not meet other people you do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, unless for a permitted reason.

Stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household. Detailed guidance on the national lockdown: You must not leave or be outside of your home except where you have a 'reasonable excuse'. This will be put in law. The police can take action against you if you leave home without a 'reasonable excuse', and issue you with a fine (Fixed Penalty Notice). You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400. A 'reasonable excuse' includes: Work - you can only leave home for work purposes where it is unreasonable for you to do your job from home

Volunteering - you can also leave home to provide voluntary or charitable services

Essential activities - you can leave home to buy things at shops or obtain services. You may also leave your home to do these things on behalf of a disabled or vulnerable person or someone self-isolating

Education and childcare - you can only leave home for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children where they are eligible to attend.

Meeting others and care - you can leave home to visit people in your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one), to provide informal childcare for children under 14 as part of a childcare bubble (for example, to enable parents to work), to provide care for disabled or vulnerable people

Exercise - you can continue to exercise alone, with one other person or with your household or support bubble, limited to once per day, and not outside your local area

Medical reasons - you can leave home for a medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and emergencies

Harm and compassionate visits - you can leave home to be with someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse).

You can also leave home to visit someone who is dying or someone in a care home (if permitted under care home guidance), hospice, or hospital, or to accompany them to a medical appointment

Animal welfare reasons – you can leave home for animal welfare reasons, such as to attend veterinary services for advice or treatment

Communal worship and life events - You can leave home to attend or visit a place of worship for communal worship, a funeral or event related to a death, a burial ground or a remembrance garden, or to attend a wedding ceremony. There are further reasonable excuses. For example, you may leave home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or where it is reasonably necessary for voting in an election or referendum.

The risk of becoming infected with Covid while socialising outdoors is 'much, much lower' than doing the same indoors, say leading scientists.

Even the slightest breeze will radically cut the chance of receiving an infectious dose from a nearby diner, as the air movement will prevent build-up of Sars-Cov-2 particles.

What's more, the paucity of infections believed to have taken place outside adds to the fact the infection risk in open air is likely to be very low indeed, they say.

But transmission could still occur if people are sitting at the same outside table, they caution.

Explaining why infection risks are far lower outdoors than in, ventilation expert Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University, said: 'The biggest factor is the much, much lower level of concentration of virus particles that you would be subjected to in an outdoor setting.

'Fresh air effectively carries the virus away.'

This dilution makes 'a huge difference as evidence shows people are able to fend off infection if they are exposed to a low dose'.

But Dr Fitzgerald stressed the importance of keeping a distance in face-to-face outdoor settings to avoid larger droplets.

It comes as hoards of lockdown-weary revellers didn't appear to be worried about the rules as they flocked to the great outdoors on the first weekend of fine weather since England's third dreary shutdown began last month.

Current restrictions forbid meeting other people you do not live with, or have formed a support bubble with, unless for a permitted reason.

Any outdoor gatherings must be limited to between just two people from two households, yet crowds of sunseekers took to beaches and green spaces across the country on Saturday, just days ahead of Boris Johnson's 'roadmap' to freedom announcement.

No 10 insisted yesterday that increasing social contact for families was an 'absolute priority' in easing lockdown, with many having now gone several weeks without seeing loved ones since the restrictions were ramped up at the start of January.

In a positive boost for the PM's highly-anticipated plans for life after lockdown, figures show Britain's second Covid wave is continuing to shrink as a further 445 people died after testing positive - down 28 per cent on last Saturday.

And yesterday's daily case total has dropped too, with 10,406 people testing positive. The figure is 21.8 per cent lower than the 13,308 seen on this day last week and is the lowest week-on-week Saturday rise since the end of September.

Under Mr Johnson's plan - set to be announced on Monday - pubs will be given the green light to serve people outdoors from April, while two households of any size will be allowed to meet outside.

Current rules ban picnics and outdoor gatherings - with Britons ordered to stay indoors for all but essential reasons, such as Government-mandated daily exercise.

Ministers are keen to focus on the outdoors when relaxing social contact rules, as virus transmission is deemed less of a risk.

But revellers appeared to be unable to wait for the imminent rule change, with coat-clad crowds soaking up the sun as the mercury started to creep up this morning.

Countless Britons gathered in Victoria Park, Wimbledon and Primrose Hill in London to enjoy the mild weather on Saturday - with many stopping for breaks on benches and grassy areas.

Adding to the pull to the great outdoors was the promise of skyrocketing temperatures, with highs of 63F (17C) predicted - and the potential to hit the 64F (18C) mark in some regions.

Warm weather will be a welcome break for those still recovering from the 'dangerous' blizzards and sub-zero temperatures brought by the 'Baltic Beast' - or Beast from the East II - earlier this month.

A 16-year-old with no known underlying health conditions was among those who died after testing positive for Covid in England, Saturday's figures show.

Official statistics revealed another 307 people who tested positive for coronavirus died in hospital in England, aged between 16 and 100. All except four - aged between 16 and 68 - had known underlying health conditions.

Scotland recorded a further 803 new cases of coronavirus, along with 29 new deaths. Wales recorded a further 363 positive tests and an additional 16 fatalities.

Yesterday's data also revealed the UK has hit a grand total of 17,852,327 jabs. Of these, 17,247,442 were first doses - a rise of 371,906 on the previous day - data up to February 19 showed.

Some 604,885 were second doses, an increase of 15,294 on figures released on Thursday.

The Prime Minister is poised to allow more social mixing within weeks, providing a light at the end of the tunnel for millions of grandparents isolated from their grandchildren.

Ministers are looking at the data and a final decision on when the restrictions will be eased will be taken at the weekend.

It is thought the new plan could replace the 'Rule of Six' as entire families, regardless of size, are expected to be allowed to meet up in outside spaces.

From April, two households would be able to meet outdoors while gatherings of six people from six different households would also be acceptable.

Relatives who live further away from each other may have to wait a little longer for a reunion, as the future rules on travelling longer distances are still unclear. And in the case of those who do meet up, the two-metre rule is expected to remain in place for months to come.

'So that absolutely costs lives and its quite disappointing that the government hasn't produced in any way… if you magnify that. 'No one has asked us these numbers. So how does the Government even know what is going on in the economy?' Advertisement

However, the First Minister of Wales raised the prospect that these could be possible as soon as Easter yesterday, saying that self-catering accommodation could be re-opened in the principality.

Mark Drakeford said allowing people to rent out self-contained accommodation would be a big boost to the tourism industry.

He said that following a meeting with tourism bosses yesterday, he was hoping to relax some measures 'around the Easter period'.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The most that we would be doing would be the reopening of self-contained accommodation where there aren't shared facilities and there isn't social mixing.

'But if we could do that – and six weeks is a very long time in this business – if we could do that in six weeks' time, I know that would be a boost to the industry and a big boost to hundreds of thousands of families in Wales for whom going down [to] the caravan for a few days for a break would be a very welcome prospect.'

Meanwhile there are also indications that Britons may yet be able to go on foreign holidays this summer. The Government is considering internationally recognised vaccination passports that will allow people to travel and is in talks with holiday destinations such as Greece about how they will work.

The roadmap is not expected to include a timeline for easing restrictions on holidays.

One Government source said: 'It's looking increasingly positive on summer holidays. Once the vaccination passport system is set up it should be straightforward. That won't be easy, but we can see the way ahead.'

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said no firm decisions had been taken but 'we will speak to international partners about what they may require and respect that'.

He told the BBC: 'It would be wrong for me to start speculating now. We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that.'

Haris Theoharis, the Greek tourism minister, said that vaccination passports and mass testing could allow for a 'semi-normal summer'.

The aviation industry are expecting a task force to be announced to come up with a plan for when international travel could be re-started. An industry source said: 'I think that provides the Government the ability to say we've heard aviation, while telling the public, we're not moving too fast here.

'What's frustrating for us is we've been trying to do our part to support the Government but we've been getting very little support back.'",MailOnline,"['support', 'outdoors', 'minister', 'getting', 'leave', 'infected', 'socialising', 'week', 'positive', 'lower', 'covid19', 'restrictions', 'pictured', 'going', 'weeks', 'risk']",0
2021-02-21 20:36:25+00:00,16,"Scientists have criticised the slow pace of China's investigation into the origins of Covid-19 as 'implausible', as reports claim that the 'patient zero' was not properly contact traced.

A World Health Organisation report is set to recommend extensive contact tracing of the first known patient in Wuhan, China, as well as the supply chain of traders in the city's Huanan seafood market.

The 'wet' market - where exotic live animals were traded - is believed to have played a key role in the early spread of the virus in late 2019.

But independent scientists have said they can't understand why Chinese scientists had not done the recommended investigative work months ago.

Scientists have criticised the slow pace of China's investigation into the origins of Covid-19 as 'implausible', as reports claim that the 'patient zero' was not properly contact traced

Professor Maureen Miller, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, said: 'It's implausible that this research has not been done. It's not realistic, given they have world-class scientists there, and the technology invested in over the last 20 years.

Miller, who was shown a copy of the to-be-published report by CNN, said the first patient's infection on December 8 without direct contact with the wet market or travel shows there was already community transmission.

'In the short and long term, it is detrimental to China to try to hide the fact that this virus started in China and was exported around the world,' she told the website.

Professor Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it was surprising China 'hasn't invested in investigating two important clues like that.'

A team of 10 WHO scientists travelled to Wuhan in January - over a year after the first infection - to carry out an independent investigation of the virus' origins

He added the country had recently mobilised the entire city of Beijing to find the source of a Covid-19 outbreak.

'They have top-notch scientists, who are much more knowledgeable than most in terms of recognising the importance of this information,' he said.

Huang added that the WHO recommendations showed they were 'uncovering some interesting information tracing of the origins of the virus.'

A team of 10 WHO scientists travelled to Wuhan in January - over a year after the first infection - to carry out an independent investigation of the virus' origins.

But unable to provide any significant findings, the group's trip was criticised as a 'charade', and US officials in the Trump administration accused China of trying to hide information from them.

WHO scientists have since said they were unable to rule out that the virus had escaped from a lab, or that the first infection came from inside China.

Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told reporters that an independent report on the coronavirus' origins 'doesn't mean bowing to the Western approach towards China based on presumption of guilt'

However they have managed to discover several signs that there was a much wider outbreak in December 2019 than was reported earlier.

The leader of the WHO mission, Peter Ben Embarek, declined to comment on the details of any further contact tracing or testing that could be recommended. He told CNN: 'Further studies are needed.'

On February 18, Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told reporters that an independent report on the coronavirus' origins 'doesn't mean bowing to the Western approach towards China based on presumption of guilt.'

Chunying added: 'China has conducted a very thorough, professional, science-based study with the WHO experts,' and insisted the WHO panel was satisfied with China's cooperation.

2021-02-19 14:43:03+00:00,20,"A leading Chinese COVID-19 expert has demanded the United States invite the World Health Organization (WHO) to its biological warfare laboratories to trace the source of the coronavirus pandemic.

'The United States must be the focus of the focus in the origin-tracing works of the novel coronavirus,' said Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese CDC.

Mr Zeng's statement gave a fresh push to Beijing's unproven claims that the global health crisis started outside China. Communist officials have repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory that links the origins of COVID-19 to a US army laboratory.

Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese CDC, has indicated that COVID-19 could have come from the US. The picture shows Mr Zeng talking to state media in a separate interview

Mr Zeng, a member of China's COVID-19 expert team, criticised the United States for being 'nontransparent' after WHO experts had completed a tightly controlled tour in Wuhan, where COVID-19 first emerged over a year ago.

Speaking to guacha.cn, a Chinese website, the epidemiologist insisted that it would be crucial for WHO experts to probe 'certain' laboratories in America.

He said: 'American biological labs can be found across the world. Why does the United States need to set up so many labs? What are its purposes?

'On many things, the United States requires others to be open and transparent. But in the end, it is often the United States itself that has been the most nontransparent.'

The CDC official insisted that Washington open itself up for probes 'no matter if the United States has indeed played any special tricks on the novel coronavirus issue or not'.

'The United States must be the focus of the focus in the origin-tracing works of the novel coronavirus,' said Mr Zeng. The above picture shows Peter Ben Embarek, a member of the WHO team attends the WHO-China joint study news conference in Wuhan on February 9

Mr Zeng carried on by accusing America of covering its mistakes and shifting responsibility to others.

He blasted: 'The United States should bear the responsibility of proving itself to the world instead of indulging itself in hegemonic thinking.'

He regarded those theories, which associate the pandemic with some American laboratories of biological weapons, as 'not completely groundless'.

'The United States should be like China and work with the WHO openly, inviting international experts to America to conduct on-site investigations at certain labs. Only in this way can the United States convince all,' Mr Zeng concluded.

Mr Zeng's assertions have been echoed by Hua Chunying, a spokesperson from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

During a press briefing on Thursday, Ms Hua urged Washington to 'provide all relevant raw data', 'work with the WHO comprehensively and thoroughly' and 'invite WHO experts to go to the United States to carry out an origin-tracing inspection and publish an independent conclusion'.

Hua Chunying (pictured), a spokesperson from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has made similar comments that point the possible source of the coronavirus to the United States

China has been accused of taking the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins.

Among powerful forces around the world, Beijing's propaganda machines played a key role in churning out conspiracies about the coronavirus originating from other countries, according to a nine-month investigation by Associated Press.

Earlier this month, Wang Wenbin, another spokesperson from China's foreign ministry, told a press briefing that the United States should adopt a 'positive, scientific and cooperative attitude' towards the probe of the virus's source.

Weeks before, Beijing's state broadcaster told its millions of viewers that 'something fishy' was going on at the Fort Detrick lab, reviving rumour that the contagion could have come from there.

The official report came three days after Beijing urged Washington to 'open the biological lab at Fort Detrick' and 'invite WHO experts to conduct origin-tracing in the United States' in an apparent attempt to point the source of the virus to America.

China's state broadcaster CCTV suggested that 'something fishy' was going on at the Fort Detrick lab in the United States during a news programme on January 21 (screenshot above)

China's Central Television Station claimed that the lab was branded as 'the darkest experiment centre of the US government' by American political news sites - without mentioning specific publications. A scientist is pictured working in the lab in the above photo from March 19, 2020

The novel coronavirus, scientifically known as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in Wuhan, a city in central China's Hubei Province, in December 2019.

Most of the first cases recorded in Wuhan came from a seafood market, which, among others, sold live wild animals such as snakes, rats, beavers and foxes.

However, several conspiracy theories have appeared on the internet since the beginning of the pandemic.

They suggest that the virus could have been purposely created as a biological weapon or escaped from a lab - claims that have been 'strongly condemned' by scientists around the world.

As early as April last year, a Chinese state TV presenter claimed that the coronavirus originated from the US instead of China in an Arabic programme.

The anchor, who calls herself 'Ms V', referred to several conspiracy theories in an opinion show on CGTN, the English arm of CCTV, to prove 'it is clear that the virus in China was transmitted from abroad'.

Most of the first cases recorded in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic were associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, seen in a picture taken on March 20, 2020

The Arabic-speaking reporter hinted that the contagion could have escaped from Fort Detrick or been brought into China during the Military World Games in Wuhan - a theory promoted by another foreign ministry's spokesperson, Zhao Lijian.

Ms V suggested that that the 'CDC suddenly and completely shut down' the Fort Detrick Biological Weapons Laboratory after failing to 'fully prevent the loss of pathogens'.

2021-02-19 08:36:54+00:00,39,"The first 'real-world' data examining the impact of vaccines suggests the Oxford and Pfizer jabs cut two thirds of infections and transmissions.

The data, which supports Britain's policy of widening the time between doses, will show one shot of either of the vaccines will have that effect on people of all ages.

Boris Johnson is expected to hear evidence on the impact of jabs on transmission, infection, hospital admissions and deaths by the end of Friday.

This will be ahead of the PM's highly-anticipated 'roadmap' out of England's lockdown on Monday.

It comes as it was revealed Britons as young as 40 could be offered a jab within a few weeks.

Government advisers are set to recommend the next phase of the vaccine rollout continues on the basis of age, rather than prioritising key workers.

The data, which supports Britain's policy of widening the time between doses, will show one shot of either of the vaccines will have that effect on people of all ages. Pictured: A person gets the coronavirus vaccine in Westfield Stratford City shopping centre on Thursday

Boris Johnson is expected to hear evidence on the impact of jabs on transmission, infection, hospital admissions and deaths by Friday

This will come ahead of the PM's highly-anticipated 'roadmap' out of England's lockdown on Monday

The 'real world' data, from Public Health England studies with 40,000 healthcare workers and 9,000 care homes, are to be released later this month.

But Mr Johnson is reportedly going to get preliminary results - showing the positive impact of the Oxford and Pfizer jabs in cutting infections - early.

Sources told the Telegraph the data was 'very encouraging' and will play a large part in when England is opened up again.

Most of the data is on the effect of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after doses were first given in December.

But similar results were found with the Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs, just on a smaller scale due to it being rolled out later.

A PHE spokesman said: 'We have been analysing the data since the start of the vaccination rollout and will publish our findings in due course.'

Meanwhile it was revealed today Britons as young as 40 could be offered a jab within a few weeks.

Government advisers are set to recommend the next phase of the vaccine rollout continues on the basis of age, rather than prioritising key workers.

But the age brackets will be wider than before – meaning 40 to 49-year-olds are likely to be invited to have a jab once the 32million people in the top nine groups have had their first dose.

Earlier this week it emerged this target could be hit as soon as March 24, if the daily average is maintained.

This would mean the over-40s being invited for a jab in less than five weeks.

It would be a huge boost for Britain's vaccine programme and could add to the pressure on ministers to ease the lockdown sooner.

The priority list for the rollout is determined by the Government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which met yesterday to draft its recommendations for the next phase.

These are expected to be signed off by members today before being sent to ministers to approve at the start of next week.

It is understood the committee rejected the idea of prioritising key workers or ethnic minorities in favour of a simple age-based approach.

Vaccine age bands are set to be widened, with no priority for key workers, meaning that over-40s could get a first does of a Covid jab by the end of March. Pictured: A vaccinator administers an injection of AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine to a patient at the vaccination centre set up at Chester Racecourse, in Chester, England, on February 15

In further encouraging news Public Health England (PHE) said cases were still falling in all regions, while separate figures suggested deaths among the over-80s are down by two thirds in three weeks.

Boris Johnson is due to unveil his roadmap out of lockdown on Monday after a meeting of his 'Covid O' committee and data – expected today – on how well the vaccine rollout is working.

The Mail revealed this week that under the current plans, life is unlikely to return to normal until July.

That has led to pressure on Mr Johnson to go further in easing restrictions.

The first 15million people to receive the jab were prioritised by five-year age bands, and also included front-line health and social care workers.

The current phase includes everyone over 50 as well as those who have certain underlying medical conditions.

It had been thought this group would all have been offered the first dose by the start of May, but it emerged earlier this week that the target could be hit much sooner – potentially in late March.

A graph showing the number of vaccines per day in the UK. Over 16.4 million people have so far received at least one dose in the UK

The issue of who should be prioritised next has been debated for weeks, with many arguing key workers – such as police or teachers – should be offered a jab first.

It has also been suggested ethnic minorities should be prioritised as data from the first wave suggested they were up to twice as likely to die from Covid.

Members of the JCVI are said to be satisfied that those at highest risk within the key worker and ethnic minority groups are already accounted for, due to being 'clinically vulnerable' or 'over 50'.

However, they are believed to have suggested the age brackets could be widened from five years to ten in the next phase.

This is because the difference in death risk between someone aged 30 and someone aged 39 is significantly less than between a 70-year-old and a 79-year-old.

There is therefore no need to segment younger people into such narrow age categories.

Ministers may still take a 'political decision' to prioritise teachers and other front-line workers, contrary to the committee's guidance.

There is a chance some other medical conditions may be added to the priority list, too.

2021-02-19 02:30:09+00:00,25,"The coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and moderna may be less effective against the highly contagious variant first detected in South Africa.

In two new studies, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the vaccines seemed to generate enough antibodies to neutralize the virus.

But the study of the Pfizer shot found that it offered roughly two-thirds less antibody protection.

And the Moderna study found a six-fold decrease in antibody response against the variant from its vaccine.

The findings raise concerns that the companies may need to develop a booster shot to add protection against the variant that is now in 10 U.S. states.

It comes the heels of news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday that Bristol variant of the virus - which has the same makeup of the UK variant with an additional mutation - has been detected for the first time in the U.S.

A study found that Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine offered roughly two-thirds less antibody protection against the South African variant (right, purple) compared to the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials (left, black)

A separate study found Moderna's vaccine had a six-fold decrease in antibody response against the variant (far right) that other common versions of the virus

Both shots seemed to generate enough antibodies to neutralize the variant that has been found in 10 states (purple dot)

The South African variant was first discovered in December, and shares mutation with the UK variant.

In January, President Joe Biden invoked a travel ban on people coming from South Africa in an effort to stop importation of the new variant.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, says that the South African variant is the most concerning one because it might render vaccines less effective due to mutations that help it 'hide' from antibodies developed after vaccination or a previous bout of COVID-19.

For the Pfizer study, scientists from the company and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) developed an engineered virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike protein, of the highly contagious variant, known as B.1.351.

The spike protein is used by the virus to enter and infect human cells, and is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.

Researchers tested the engineered virus against blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine.

The findings raise concerns that the companies will need to develop booster shots to offer enough protection against the variant known as B.1.351. Pictured (left to right): Vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines

They found that only one-third of its neutralizing antibodies were activated compared with its effect on the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials.

Because there is no established benchmark yet to determine what level of antibodies are needed to protect against the virus, it is unclear whether that two-thirds reduction will render the vaccine ineffective against the variant spreading around the world.

However, UTMB professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he believes the Pfizer vaccine will likely be protective against the variant.

'We don't know what the minimum neutralizing number is. We don't have that cutoff line,' he said, adding that he suspects the immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection.

This is because, in clinical trials, both the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine conferred some protection after a single dose with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels caused by the South African variant in the laboratory study.

Currently, the U.S. is vaccinating average of 1.7 million Americans per day against COVID-19, up from under in one million a month ago

Biden is currently on track to blow past his goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, but vaccinations must be ramped ur to meet his plans to vaccinate nearly all adults by the end of the summer.

Even if the concerning variant significantly reduces effectiveness, the vaccine should still help protect against severe disease and death, he noted.

Health experts have said that is the most important factor in keeping stretched healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed.

For the Moderna study, the team looked at blood samples of people that had been given their vaccine.

Next, they studied the neutralizing antibodies of the South African variant, the UK variant and others included the variant discovered in mink in Denmark.

The data, from the experiment performed last month, found a significant reduction in coronavirus-fighting antibodies

When the full group of South African mutations was examined, there was six-fold drop in antibody levels compared to earlier versions of the virus.

Moderna also said the actual efficacy of its vaccine against the South African variant is yet to be determined.

The company has previously said it believes the vaccine will work against the variant.

Currently, the U.S. is vaccinating average of 1.7 million Americans per day against COVID-19, up from under in one million a month ago.

Biden is currently on track to blow past his goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office - though the pace must pick up even further to meet his plans to vaccinate nearly all adults by the end of the summer.

The White House also said the government will ramp up genetic analysis of coronavirus samples from around the country to gain information on where more infectious and potentially deadlier mutations may be spreading.

According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 70,188 new COVID-19 cases and 2,459 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday.

This is a dramatic decline from the record-high for new infections of 299,087 on January 2 and the record-high for fatalities of 5,077 on February 4.

Today's virtual G7 meeting will be Mr Johnson's first major multilateral summit with new US President Joe Biden.

They are due to meet in person at a scaled-down summer G7 summit in Cornwall – with attendees subjected to a strict Covid testing regime.

PHE said 147 out of 149 councils saw a drop in their infection rates in the seven days to February 14;

Dozens of MPs warned Britain was facing a 'cancer disaster' that could cost tens of thousands of lives;

It was announced yesterday that a further 454 people had died and another 12,057 had tested positive for the virus.

Mr Johnson will vow to share up to 75 per cent of the UK's surplus vaccine supplies with developing nations under the international Covax initiative.

Countries such as Ireland, which have been hard-hit by production problems, could benefit – although no firm decisions have yet been made.

The details of Britain's donation will be settled later this year, once it has been determined whether residents require third doses or booster jabs for emerging variants.

The UK has ordered more than 400million jabs from seven different companies, including 100million doses of the Oxford vaccine.

The total number of orders works out at around five vaccine doses per head – meaning there should be a sizeable surplus.

Doses could be deemed surplus to our requirements while still in production, meaning they could be diverted to those in need without ever reaching British shores.

The UK hopes to have offered a vaccine to its entire adult population by the autumn – but the World Health Organisation has warned of a looming 'catastrophic moral failure' amid concerns that poorer countries would struggle to secure supplies.

Professor Azeem Majeed of Imperial College London today told Good Morning Britain spare vaccines will only be offered to developing countries once this process is completed.

He said: ‘We plan to vaccinate everyone in the UK by September so the plan is to finish that process first and only offer spare vaccines once we have enough to vaccinate our own population, which I think is a reasonable step to do.

‘So hopefully by the summer everyone will have been offered a vaccine and then we’ll have vaccinations to offer to other countries.'

Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed this week that he hoped all adults in Britain would be offered the vaccination 'a bit before' September.

The Covax group has already agreed deals for 1.1billion doses. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said yesterday: 'Vaccinating everyone, everywhere, is our collective way out of this pandemic.

'It won't change our vaccination campaigns, but each country should set aside a small number of the doses it has to transfer tens of millions of them, but very fast, so that people on the ground see it happening.'

'International co-operation has to be at the heart of this effort, so we are calling on the G7 and other nations to step up support to get vaccines to everyone.'

Today's virtual summit will see Mr Johnson urge Britain's fellow members – the US, Japan, Canada, Germany, France and Italy – to increase funding for Covax.

In addition, he will call on the group to support the 100-day target set by the international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) for developing and approving new vaccines and treatments.

Mr Johnson's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance is to work with the WHO and Cepi, along with industry experts, in the drive to secure faster results.

'Perhaps more than ever, the hopes of the world rest on the shoulders of scientists,' Mr Johnson will say. 'Over the last year, like countless times before, they have risen to the challenge.

'The development of viable coronavirus vaccines offers the tantalising prospect of a return to normality, but we must not rest on our laurels. As leaders of the G7 we must say today 'never again'.

By harnessing our collective ingenuity, we can ensure we have the vaccines, treatments and tests to be battle-ready for future health threats.'

Today's video conference marks the first meeting of the G7 since last April, with leaders due to travel to England in June.

Officials insisted yesterday that the Cornwall summit is likely to go ahead in person, albeit on a much smaller scale than previous meetings.

Mr Johnson, Mr Biden and others will be subjected to rigorous virus testing, and a 'bubble' system will be used to prevent the spread of infection.

The Prime Minister has also invited the leaders of India, South Korea and Australia to Cornwall, with a view to creating a 'D10' group of leading democracies.

Bonnie Jacobson, 34, said she is not an 'anti-vaxxer' but wanted to wait for more research as she recently starting trying to get pregnant with her husband, she told DailyMail.com.

Jacobson, who started working at the Red Hook Tavern in August, said the restaurant first sent out an email on February 8 which said: 'If you choose to get vaccinated, here’s what you need to know.'

That email, reviewed by DailyMail.com, did not tell employees that vaccinations were required.

Jacobson said she told her manager during a staff meeting that she wanted more time to research the vaccine and said her manager initially understood her concerns, telling her she would not be required to get the shot.

But the Brooklyn tavern changed its mind days later on February 12 and sent workers and email noting the vaccines were mandatory.

Jacobson said she wanted to wait to get the coronavirus vaccine after workers were sent an email telling them it was mandatory

'Please be advised that we will require that all employees receive the vaccination,' notes the email.

'This will be mandatory for all existing employees and any new hires. The exception to this policy will be if your own personal health or disability prohibits you from obtaining this vaccination. We encourage you to consult your healthcare professional to determine if getting a vaccine is right for you.'

Jacobson then emailed her employers on Saturday and said that she did not yet want to get the vaccine, which she said she 'fully supports.'

'I am choosing not to get the vaccine because there just isn’t enough data or research at this point on its effects on fertility,' she wrote to her boss.

'While I fully support the vaccine and understand its importance I do believe this is a very personal choice. I really hope this choice would not affect my employment at Red Hook Tavern.'

In her email, Jacobson noted that she takes COVID 'very seriously,' and has practiced the safety guidelines and would continue to do so.

'I get tested every 1-2 weeks and have never tested positive for COVID. I plan to continue these safety practices for as long as necessary,' she wrote.

She continued: 'Also once there is more research to support that it does not affect fertility I would reconsider my position.'

But on Monday, Jacobson received an email back noting her 'very personal choice' and saying the company 'respected' her decision to not get vaccinated.

'In order to continue employment with us, getting the vaccine is required. At this time your employment will be terminated. We are sad to see you go. If you do change your mind, please do not hesitate to let us know,' the company wrote.

DailyMail.com has reached out to Red Hook Tavern owner Billy Durney for additional information and further comments.

Red Hook Tavern owner Billy Durney said he could have handled the situation differently

Durney said the Red Hook Tavern would update its policy so it’s clear to its employees how the process works

Jacobson said her concerns were sparked when she saw articles online indicating vaccines could cause infertility. After further research, most of what she saw was debunked, she acknowledged.

'The research does say there is no evidence to support it does cause fertility. But there is not enough data to say it doesn’t,' she said.

'As a 34-year-old woman, why take the risk right now when I can just wait a little longer when there are people a lot older and more at risk who could use the vaccine more than I could right now?'

She added: 'My dad is 68 years old and lives in Pennsylvania and has diabetes, there’s no reason why I should be getting that before him.'

Jacobson said she was frustrated that the restaurant didn't even give her the chance to have an in-person conversation about the vaccine requirements, and said she might have been convinced into getting one.

'I just wanted more time they didn’t allow me that, I didn’t even have time to consult a physician. It was a week from being 'your choice,' to it's not going to be mandatory, to it us mandatory, to you’re fired,' she said.

'I had a very good working relationship there. I just had an employee review on February 6 and it was all positive, so it was truly shocking that it was so impersonal.'

Jacobson said that when she sent her email on Saturday, she expected the restaurant's management would have a conversation with her directly if they wanted her to get the vaccine.

'The conversation may have swayed me the other way. When I first saw the email about getting fired, I thought, ""Okay, maybe I will get vaccinated."" So they maybe could have talked me into getting vaccinated,' she said.

Durney acknowledged to The New York Times that he could have handled the situation differently.

'Once New York state allowed restaurant workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, we thought this was the perfect opportunity to put a plan in place to keep our team and guests safe,' Durney said in an emailed statement obtained by the outlets.

He continued: 'No one has faced these challenges before and we made a decision that we thought would best protect everyone,'

'And, we now realize that we need to update our policy so it’s clear to our team how the process works and what we can do to support them. We’re making these changes immediately.'

Jacobson said she was not offered her job back,and would not accept it if she was.

Restaurant employees were among the first groups to be eligible to get the vaccine in New York outside of the health care industry and can help struggling businesses bring back diners.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces workplace discrimination laws, does allow companies to mandate the flu and other vaccines.

In December, the agency issued guidelines ruling that companies can require employees to get vaccinated but had to provide 'reasonable accommodations' to those with disabilities.

Some existing laws could throw uncertainty to the legality of requiring a woman who is already pregnant to get the vaccine.

LEGAL EXEMPTIONS FOR MANDATORY VACCINATION PROGRAMS Religious Accommodations Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 The law prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. This means employees can request an exemption to mandatory vaccination programs if it goes against a 'sincerely held religious belief.' Establishing the case may be challenging however, depending on how jurisdictions define religious beliefs. Personal or ethical objections or personal anti-vaccination positions are not covered by this law. Medical Accommodations Under the ADA Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employees can object to a mandatory vaccine policy for medical reasons. The worker is required to prove they have a medical condition that makes it unsafe to get a vaccine. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970 Section 11(c) of the act pertains to whistle blower rights. 'An employee who refuses vaccination because of a reasonable belief that he or she has a medical condition that creates a real danger of serious illness or death (such as serious reaction to the vaccine)' may be protected under this law.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, and sex, including pregnancy.

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act forbids discrimination based on pregnancy, including hiring and firing, If a woman is temporarily unable to perform her job due to a medical condition related to pregnancy.

The American Disabilities Act notes that pregnancy alone cannot be deemed a disabling condition requiring reasonable accommodations, but many pregnancy-related conditions are considered disabilities.

Labor lawyer Carolyn D. Richmond told The New York Times it is too early in the distribution of the vaccine for companies to mandate employees get the shot.

'Pregnancy and vaccine — as soon as you hear those words in the workplace, you should stop to think if what you are doing is right or wrong,' said Richmond, who advises the NYC Hospitality Alliance.

'It has to be generally available to the employee population and it's not. None of us are having an easy time getting appointments.'

Adam Mastroleo, a lawyer with Syracuse-based Bond, Schoeneck and King, told Syracuse.com that everyone has the right to choose whether or not to get the vaccine because it was approved under emergency authorization.

Others claim that laws are pretty clear about whether employers can force their workers to get a vaccine.

Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law, told CNBC that private businesses have extensive rights.

“Requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule, and employers can do that,” Reiss told the outlet in December.

Hana El Sahly, a doctor who oversaw a clinical trial for Moderna’s vaccine, told CNBC that hospitals could eventually make the COVID vaccine a condition of employment.

The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were not tested on pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and their 'actual risks' to pregnant women and their fetuses remains unknown.

2021-02-18 14:58:19+00:00,17,"By the thousands, US service members are refusing or putting off the COVID-19 vaccine as frustrated commanders scramble to knock down internet rumors and find the right pitch that will persuade troops to get the shot.

Air Force Major General Jeff Taliaferro, vice director of operations for the Joint Staff, told Congress on Wednesday that 'very early data' suggests that just up to two-thirds of the service members offered the vaccine have accepted.

That's higher than the rate for the general population, which a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation put at roughly 50 per cent.

So far, almost 150,000 service members have been fully vaccinated, defense officials told lawmakers. There are about 1.3 million active-duty troops, according to The Washington Post.

If one-third of troops have refused and 150,000 have agreed to get the vaccine, that means some 75,000 soldiers have declined the offer so far.

Military leaders searching for answers believe they have identified one potential convincer: an imminent deployment.

Navy sailors on ships heading out to sea last week, for example, were choosing to take the shot at rates exceeding 80 per cent to 90 per cent.

Members of the United States military attend a press conference following the opening of a new large scale COVID-19 vaccination site at Cal State Los Angeles on Tuesday

The significant number of forces declining the vaccine is especially worrisome because troops often live, work and fight closely together in environments where social distancing and wearing masks, at times, are difficult.

The military's resistance also comes as troops are deploying to administer shots at vaccination centers around the country and as leaders look to American forces to set an example for the nation.

'We're still struggling with what is the messaging and how do we influence people to opt in for the vaccine,' said Brigadier General Edward Bailey, the surgeon for Army Forces Command.

He said that in some units just 30 per cent have agreed to take the vaccine, while others are between 50 per cent and 70 per cent.

Forces Command oversees major Army units, encompassing about 750,000 Army, Reserve and National Guard soldiers at 15 bases.

At Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where several thousand troops are preparing for future deployments, the vaccine acceptance rate is about 60 per cent, Bailey said.

Senior military officials said that as many as one in three US service members have so far refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine (like the one seen in the above file photo)

That's 'not as high as we would hope for front-line personnel,' he said.

Bailey has heard all the excuses.

'I think the most amusing one I heard was, ""The Army always tells me what to do, they gave me a choice, so I said no"",' he said.

Service leaders have vigorously campaigned for the vaccine.

They have held town halls, written messages to the force, distributed scientific data, posted videos, and even put out photos of leaders getting vaccinated.

For weeks, the Pentagon insisted it did not know how many troops were declining the vaccine.

On Wednesday they provided few details on their early data.

Officials from individual military services, however, said in interviews with The Associated Press that refusal rates vary widely, depending on a service member's age, unit, location, deployment status and other intangibles.

The variations make it harder for leaders to identify which arguments for the vaccine are most persuasive.

The Food and Drug Administration has allowed emergency use of the vaccine, so it's voluntary.

But Defense Department officials say they hope that soon may change.

'We cannot make it mandatory yet,' Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis, commander of the Navy's 2nd Fleet, said last week.

'I can tell you we're probably going to make it mandatory as soon as we can, just like we do with the flu vaccine.'

About 40 Marines gathered recently in a California conference room for an information session from medical staff.

One officer, who was not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Marines are more comfortable posing questions about the vaccine in smaller groups.

The officer said one Marine, citing a widely circulated and false conspiracy theory, said: 'I heard that this thing is actually a tracking device.'

The medical staff, said the officer, quickly debunked that theory, and pointed to the Marine's cellphone, noting that it's an effective tracker.

Other frequent questions revolved around possible side effects or health concerns, including for pregnant women.

Army, Navy and Air Force officials say they hear much the same.

The Marine Corps is a relatively small service and troops are generally younger.

Similar to the general population, younger service members are more likely to decline or ask to wait.

In many cases, military commanders said, younger troops say they have had the coronavirus or known others who had it, and concluded it was not bad.

'What they're not seeing is that 20-year-olds who've actually gotten very sick, have been hospitalized or die, or the folks who appear to be fine but then it turns out they've developed pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities,' Bailey said.

One ray of hope has been deployments.

Lewis, based in Norfolk, Virginia, said last week that sailors on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which is operating in the Atlantic, agreed to get the shot at a rate of about 80 per cent.

Sailors on the USS Iwo Jima and Marines in the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, who also are deploying, had rates of more than 90 per cent.

Bailey said the Army is seeing opportunities to reduce the two-week quarantine period for units deploying to Europe if service members are largely vaccinated and the host nation agrees. US Army Europe may cut the quarantine time to five days if 70 per cent of the unit is vaccinated, and that incentive could work, he said.

The acceptance numbers drop off among those who are not deploying, military officials said.

General James McConville, the Army's chief of staff, used his own experience to encourage troops to be vaccinated.

'When they asked me how it felt, I said it was a lot less painful than some of the meetings I go to in the Pentagon,' he said.

Colonel Jody Dugai, commander of the Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital at Fort Polk, Louisiana, said that so far conversations at the squad level, with eight to 10 peers, have been successful, and that getting more information helps.

At the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Brigadier General David Doyle, has a dual challenge.

As base commander, he must persuade the nearly 7,500 soldiers on base to get the shot and he needs to ensure that the thousands of troops that cycle in and out for training exercises are safe.

Doyle said the acceptance rate on his base is between 30 per cent and 40 per cent, and that most often it's the younger troops who decline.

'They tell me they don't have high confidence in the vaccine because they believe it was done too quickly,' he said.

Top health officials have attested to the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.

Doyle said it appears peers are often more influential than leaders in persuading troops - a sentiment echoed by Bailey, the Army Forces Command surgeon.

'We're trying to figure out who the influencers are,' Bailey said.

'Is it a squad leader or platoon sergeant in the Army? I think it probably is. Someone who is more of their age and interacts with them more on a regular basis versus the general officer who takes his picture and says, ""I got the shot"".'",MailOnline,"['officials', 'service', 'refuse', 'members', 'army', 'troops', 'vaccine', 'general', 'leaders', 'covid19', 'military', 'cent']",0
2021-02-18 13:16:05+00:00,10,"The coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and moderna may be less effective against the highly contagious variant first detected in South Africa.

In two new studies, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the vaccines seemed to generate enough antibodies to neutralize the virus.

But the study of the Pfizer shot found that it offered roughly two-thirds less antibody protection.

And the Moderna study found a six-fold decrease in antibody response against the variant from its vaccine.

The findings raise concerns that the companies may need to develop a booster shot to add protection against the variant that is now in 10 U.S. states.

It comes the heels of news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday that Bristol variant of the virus - which has the same makeup of the UK variant with an additional mutation - has been detected for the first time in the U.S.

A study found that Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine offered roughly two-thirds less antibody protection against the South African variant (right, purple) compared to the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials (left, black)

A separate study found Moderna's vaccine had a six-fold decrease in antibody response against the variant (far right) that other common versions of the virus

Both shots seemed to generate enough antibodies to neutralize the variant that has been found in 10 states (purple dot)

The South African variant was first discovered in December, and shares mutation with the UK variant.

In January, President Joe Biden invoked a travel ban on people coming from South Africa in an effort to stop importation of the new variant.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, says that the South African variant is the most concerning one because it might render vaccines less effective due to mutations that help it 'hide' from antibodies developed after vaccination or a previous bout of COVID-19.

For the Pfizer study, scientists from the company and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) developed an engineered virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike protein, of the highly contagious variant, known as B.1.351.

The spike protein is used by the virus to enter and infect human cells, and is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.

Researchers tested the engineered virus against blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine.

The findings raise concerns that the companies will need to develop booster shots to offer enough protection against the variant known as B.1.351. Pictured (left to right): Vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines

They found that only one-third of its neutralizing antibodies were activated compared with its effect on the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials.

Because there is no established benchmark yet to determine what level of antibodies are needed to protect against the virus, it is unclear whether that two-thirds reduction will render the vaccine ineffective against the variant spreading around the world.

However, UTMB professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he believes the Pfizer vaccine will likely be protective against the variant.

'We don't know what the minimum neutralizing number is. We don't have that cutoff line,' he said, adding that he suspects the immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection.

This is because, in clinical trials, both the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine conferred some protection after a single dose with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels caused by the South African variant in the laboratory study.

Currently, the U.S. is vaccinating average of 1.7 million Americans per day against COVID-19, up from under in one million a month ago

Biden is currently on track to blow past his goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, but vaccinations must be ramped ur to meet his plans to vaccinate nearly all adults by the end of the summer.

Even if the concerning variant significantly reduces effectiveness, the vaccine should still help protect against severe disease and death, he noted.

Health experts have said that is the most important factor in keeping stretched healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed.

For the Moderna study, the team looked at blood samples of people that had been given their vaccine.

Next, they studied the neutralizing antibodies of the South African variant, the UK variant and others included the variant discovered in mink in Denmark.

The data, from the experiment performed last month, found a significant reduction in coronavirus-fighting antibodies

When the full group of South African mutations was examined, there was six-fold drop in antibody levels compared to earlier versions of the virus.

Moderna also said the actual efficacy of its vaccine against the South African variant is yet to be determined.

The company has previously said it believes the vaccine will work against the variant.

Currently, the U.S. is vaccinating average of 1.7 million Americans per day against COVID-19, up from under in one million a month ago.

Biden is currently on track to blow past his goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office - though the pace must pick up even further to meet his plans to vaccinate nearly all adults by the end of the summer.

The White House also said the government will ramp up genetic analysis of coronavirus samples from around the country to gain information on where more infectious and potentially deadlier mutations may be spreading.

According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 70,188 new COVID-19 cases and 2,459 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday.

This is a dramatic decline from the record-high for new infections of 299,087 on January 2 and the record-high for fatalities of 5,077 on February 4.

Bonnie Jacobson, 34, said she is not an 'anti-vaxxer' but wanted to wait for more research as she recently starting trying to get pregnant with her husband, she told DailyMail.com.

Jacobson, who started working at the Red Hook Tavern in August, said the restaurant first sent out an email on February 8 which said: 'If you choose to get vaccinated, here’s what you need to know.'

However, UTMB professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he believes the Pfizer vaccine will likely be protective against the variant.

'We don't know what the minimum neutralizing number is. We don't have that cutoff line,' he said, adding that he suspects the immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection.

This is because, in clinical trials, both the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine conferred some protection after a single dose with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels caused by the South African variant in the laboratory study.

Currently, the U.S. is vaccinating average of 1.7 million Americans per day against COVID-19, up from under in one million a month ago

Biden is currently on track to blow past his goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, but vaccinations must be ramped ur to meet his plans to vaccinate nearly all adults by the end of the summer.

Even if the concerning variant significantly reduces effectiveness, the vaccine should still help protect against severe disease and death, he noted.

Health experts have said that is the most important factor in keeping stretched healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed.

For the Moderna study, the team looked at blood samples of people that had been given their vaccine.

Next, they studied the neutralizing antibodies of the South African variant, the UK variant and others included the variant discovered in mink in Denmark.

The data, from the experiment performed last month, found a significant reduction in coronavirus-fighting antibodies

When the full group of South African mutations was examined, there was six-fold drop in antibody levels compared to earlier versions of the virus.

Moderna also said the actual efficacy of its vaccine against the South African variant is yet to be determined.

The company has previously said it believes the vaccine will work against the variant.

Biden is currently on track to blow past his goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office - though the pace must pick up even further to meet his plans to vaccinate nearly all adults by the end of the summer.

The White House also said the government will ramp up genetic analysis of coronavirus samples from around the country to gain information on where more infectious and potentially deadlier mutations may be spreading.

2021-02-18 02:44:03+00:00,18,"Three genes inherited from Neanderthals slash the risk of severe Covid-19 by 22 per cent, a new study has revealed.

The genes sit next to each other on chromosome 12, and this large chunk of genetic material includes 75,000 individual pieces of DNA.

Researchers compared the DNA of 2,200 Covid-19 patients from around the world with the genes of three Neanderthals that lived 50,000, 70,000 and 120,000 years ago.

They found people with Neanderthal versions of the genes OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 were less likely to develop severe symptoms after infection with the coronavirus.

These genes produce enzymes which specifically target invading RNA viruses, and the Neanderthal version is thought to be more potent.

Previous research has found eight genetic locations spread across five chromosomes (3, 6, 12, 19 and 21) which are 'associated with risk of requiring intensive care upon SARS-CoV-2 infection'. However, the new analysis shows only those found at chromosome 3 and 12 come from Neanderthals (pictured). Chromosome 12 contains three genes which help fight Covi and slash risk of severe infection by 22%

Professor Hugo Zeberg and Dr Svante Pääbo from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, respectively, conducted the study.

Previous research has found eight genetic locations spread across five chromosomes (3, 6, 12, 19 and 21) which are 'associated with risk of requiring intensive care upon SARS-CoV-2 infection'.

However, the new analysis shows only those found at chromosome 3 and 12 originate from cross-species trysts between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.

Researchers compared the DNA of 2,200 Covid-19 patients from around the world with the genomes of three Neanderthals that lived 50,000, 70,000 and 120,000 years ago. They found people with neanderthal versions of the genes OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 were less likely to develop severe symptoms after infection with the coronavirus

The chromosome 3 gene was the subject of previous research from the same team of experts.

It revealed the Neanderthal version, which is present in around one in eight people today, actually doubles the risk of needing intensive care if a person catches Covid.

But the stretch of Neanderthal DNA on chromosome 12 is more common.

It was present in around one in ten humans that lived more than 20,000 years ago, and then increased to around 15 per cent up to 10,000 years ago.

The researchers estimate it continued to become more dominant, with around a third of people who lived between 3,000 and 1,000 years ago having it.

Five genes make you more likely to die from coronavirus or be admitted to ICU Five genes identified by the University of Edinburgh increase the likelihood of a Covid-19 patient being admitted to intensive care and dying. A landmark study published in December gathered DNA from 2,700 Covid-19 patients in 208 intensive care units across the UK. These are the most severe cases of Covid, and 22 per cent of patients studied died, with 74 per cent unable to breathe on their own and needing mechanical ventilation. The genetic information of these patients was compared to 100,000 anonymous Britons, and five genes emerged as being extremely common in severe Covid cases. Researchers say the discovery of five genes that appear so clearly to be linked to the disease is unprecedented in the field. Knowing which genes are involved in severe cases of coronavirus infection can help scientists identify pre-existing drugs that could help treat Covid, the researchers say. The genes were identified across the genome, with two on chromosome 19 called TYK2 and DPP9. One, called IFNAR2, is found on chromosome 21. CCR2 is a gene found on chromosome four and OAS1 is located on the twelfth chromosome. Advertisement

'Intriguingly, the current allele frequency in Eurasia is around 30 per cent, suggesting that the Neandertal haplotype may have increased in frequency relatively recently,' the researchers write in their paper.

They add: 'It is present in populations in Eurasia and the Americas at carrier frequencies that often reach and exceed 50 per cent.'

Dr Pääbo says it is 'striking' that two Neanderthal variants can have such drastically different impacts on human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

'This shows that our heritage from Neanderthals is a double-edged sword when it comes to our response to SARS-CoV-2,' adds Professor Zeberg.

The researchers believe the location of the Neanderthal DNA on chromosome 12 is key, as it includes three genes (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3) which play a critical role in fighting infection.

Specifically, they help produce enzymes which target and destroy invasive RNA, such as SARS-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19.

The new research, published in the journal PNAS, also found the Neanderthal variant makes more virus-fighting enzymes than the ancestral Homo sapien alternative.

'One may speculate that, when modern humans encountered new RNA viruses outside Africa, the higher enzymatic activity of the ancestral variants that they acquired through genetic interactions with Neandertals may have been advantageous,' the researchers write.

'Intriguingly, there is evidence that the Neanderthal-like OAS haplotype may have recently increased in frequency in Eurasia, suggesting that selection may have positively affected the Neandertal-derived OAS locus in the last millennium.'

Due to the ancient migratory patterns of Neanderthals and the fact they sparsely inhabited Africa before going extinct, very little Neanderthal DNA is seen in people living in sub-Saharan Africa today.

In fact, the researchers say the Neanderthal Covid-fighting genes are 'almost completely absent' from these populations.

'In the Americas, it occurs in lower frequencies in some populations of African ancestry, presumably due to gene flow from populations of European or Native American ancestry,' they add in the paper.

The latest study backs up previous findings from a separate team of researchers from Canada, which also came to the conclusion the OAS1 gene reduces the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.

Although they did not look at the gene's origin, they did find five genes which increase the odds of severe infection.

2021-02-17 21:30:03+00:00,3,"With the nation staying at home amid the Covid-19 lockdown and pubs forced to shut, some families decided to get creative and build their own in their homes and gardens.

The impressive designs have everything you'd find if you took a trip to your local - including dartboards, jukeboxes, bar snacks, Sky Sports and even a fruit machine.

With prices ranging from £400 up to a whopping £18, 000, FEMAIL takes a look at some of the best home pubs getting the country through the pandemic...

Viva las Solihull! - Creative father builds Las Vegas themed bar in his family's back garden

A creative family who were missing weekends down the pub during lockdown have built a stunning Las Vegas-themed sports bar in their back garden.

Carpenter John O'Grady, 46, from Birmingham, forked out around £50,000 creating the ultimate DIY boozer with the help of relatives - complete with a jukebox, pool table and huge TVs.

The father-of-four came up with the ingenious way to beat lockdown boredom after the family business came to a standstill during the pandemic.

So John decided to make his life-long dream come true and built his own fully-functioning bar from scratch - with all nine family members chipping in.

Inspired by Las Vegas and other places they have visited, it has draught beer pumps, a fully-stocked bar, jukebox, pool table (pictured), darts board and three TVs

The incredible homemade pub took just over four months to complete with the O'Grady's starting the project mid May and finishing in late September.

Inspired by Las Vegas and other places they have visited, it has draught beer pumps, a fully-stocked bar, jukebox, pool table, darts board and three TVs.

They also enlisted the help of a graffiti artist friend, who has decorated the whole 12m (39ft) x 6m (19ft) outbuilding with stunning murals of Vegas landmarks.

O'Grady's Bar boasts two smartly decked-out sitting areas where they can enjoy a game of poker or a few drinks while watching football on the TV.

There's also Wifi, a toilet with plumbed in Saniflow system, neon lighting, running water, central heating and is fully insulated.

The family-of-nine includes John's four kids, his son's girlfriend and his mother and father who all live together in Solihull, in the West Midlands.

They said building the state-of-the-art bar had kept them busy over the past few months and had been an ideal way to cheer them all up during lockdown.

'I'd always wanted one of those pub sheds but I thought we'd take it to the next level and just build a pub from scratch,' explained John. 'We just wanted a room where we could all just go and relax with a drink and enjoy playing pool or darts.

'I have always wanted to do it but we had just been so busy with work as we run a small little family business. We just never got around to it so when the pandemic started we had some time on our hands.

'We decided then to build what we had always wanted down the bottom of the garden - our very own bar. We're quite proud of it but no one has seen it in person. We have been stunned by the reaction from people who have seen pictures. They just can't believe it.

'I have got friends who have built them and now I feel awful when they compare it to ours. But everyone is excited now to come and have a look.

John's children Alex, 23, Thomas, 17, Alfie, 13, and eight-year-old Scarlett and wife Shell, 46, all got fully involved in the project (pictured together)

'We're looking forward to spending time there with our friends once this is all over. I can't see us going to the pub much anymore though now we have our very own at the end of the garden.'

John's children Alex, 23, Thomas, 17, Alfie, 13, and eight-year-old Scarlett and wife Shell, 46, all got fully involved in the project.

His mother Margaret, 67, and father Tom, 71, have also lived with the family for the last 10 years along with eldest son's Alex's partner 26-year-old Jade.

John added: 'It has all been one big family effort and has created brilliant memories and we know we are very lucky as we understand people have had it very tough.

'We've possibly spent around £40,000 to £50,000 on it all when you add it up. A friend of ours called David Brown, who's a graffiti artist from Birmingham, said he could do some walls for us.

'He knew we loved America and Vegas in particular and had a bit of memorabilia so that's how the theme all started really.

'It's got a projector in there now and three different TVs and it has CCTV up and around the back of the house.

'There are also fully functioning beer taps and Carling is our favourite lager so we've got barrels of Carling which we get from a local brewery. The lighting is controlled by apps, it is also fully insulated and has central heating so it's good to go in any weather.

He continued: 'Last week when it was freezing we were down there till around 11pm and it was red hot so the cold is no problem at all. The walls are also painted with UV paints on some of them so when we turn the lights off everything comes alive in there and it looks totally different.

'We just thought we wouldn't be going out for a few months, we just didn't realise it was going to last for this long.'

Pints are on me! Father builds garden pub complete with Sky Sports and a fruit machine for just £400

This father transformed a few wooden pallets into an incredible garden pub complete with Sky Sports, a dartboard, and a fruit machine - all for just £400.

Marc Lee says even his kids love spending time at 'The Boozy Bear' at their home in Kingstanding, Birmingham.

Initially, he said he put together a bit of a 'make do' bar without a roof in a spot in his garden that never got used.

The project was added to over time and now he loves spending every weekend in the DIY pub with his partner and two kids, aged 14 and 11.

Marc, who works in putting together exhibitions, said: 'It just grew from nothing really.

'We had a small dirt track beside the garage so I made a bit of an outside bar out of pallets with no roof.

'Working in exhibitions, there's normally a lot of bits of timber and plastic that just gets thrown away and I wondered if I could do something with it.'

At the start of the third lockdown, he installed a corrugated roof and PVC skimmed it to make it watertight.

He added electricity, atmospheric strip lighting, and a Heineken Blade beer machine so that he can enjoy draught pints.

He gets the beer supplied from O'Neill's Brewing Company, based at The Barn Pub & Restaurant in Willey, Warwickshire.

Marc added: 'It's turned into one of those hobbies that you don't stop spending money on. I think the total cost is around £400 and mostly recycled from exhibition waste materials.

'Now there's a dartboard, Sky Sports TV, WiFi and a fruit machine. We have a bar and bar stools. It can seat around eight to 10 people.

'My partner and kids love it. We all go in there every weekend, especially in the summer.

The bar, which has a stylish glass frontage and is around three metres by three metres, has been named 'The Boozy Bear' (pictured)

'It's been a godsend when we've not been able to go out due to lockdown. We're all big [Aston] Villa fans so we like to sit and watch the football in there.'

The bar, which has a stylish glass frontage and is around three metres by three metres, has been named 'The Boozy Bear'.

'The name is a bit of a long story,' explained Marc. 'I used to be called ""the Bear"" at work so it's kind of come from there. I'm really pleased with how the bar has turned out. It's in a space that we couldn't use for anything else so it's been great.'

Mark O'Neill supplies the draught beer for 'The Boozy Bear' and said he'd seen a surge of home bars being built across the Midlands.

Mr O'Neill said: 'Since March, we have supplied about 150 home bars across the Midlands with full size beer kegs and have since started stocking smaller kegs for blade machines.'

Cheers to that! Father splashes out £18,000 on his own boozer in the back garden

This father claims he doesn't need pubs to reopen - as he splashed £18,000 on building his own boozer in his back garden - complete with a bespoke bar, beer pumps and industrial chillers.

Darren Field-Thomas, from Derbyshire, had a light-bulb moment last year when faced with the prospect of being forced to stay indoors through the pandemic, so built the ultimate man-cave to escape to.

The father-of-five spent six months building the giant 21ft by 17ft space but says the eye-watering sum was 'worth every penny' as he recreated a full-scale pub in his back yard.

Like all good boozers, the 60-year-old's man-cave features a 7ft signature pool table, karaoke machine, a 65inch plasma TV and even a 'last orders' bell.

It even has a giant Sky Sports pub banner reading 'Watch live football here' - with relatives 'booking' it to watch games when lockdown allowed.

The operations manager shared footage of the 'one big fun area' in all its glory on LinkedIn and it amassed more than 180,000 likes, comments and views.

Darren, from Ilkeston, said: 'It truly is amazing - I'm glad I did it. I haven't skimped on anything - it's absolutely been worth every penny.

'It was absolutely fantastic when it was all finished - I can just walk down my pathway if I've got nothing to do and go in there, play pool and put the music on - it's just great.

'It's quite amazing how many people have said 'why would anyone want to go to the pub when you can come here?'.

'Once lockdown's finished you don't need to go to a pub.'

Building on the man cave began last February as Darren watched nervously as the pandemic began racing across Europe, with the main build being completed within a month.

It was completed and furnished to a high spec by August, including bespoke bi-fold doors that let in the all important sunshine during the summer months, as well as a top of the range mixer.

Darren said: 'I thought if we're in lockdown and can't go out, I'm going to build a mancave.

'We started hearing these rumours [about a lockdown] and I thought 'what am I going to do to keep the family together? Where am I going to go if we can't go out?'

The pub features a bespoke bar, beer pumps and industrial chillers. Right is the jukebox with 15,000 music videos on it

The pub even has a 'last orders' bell as well as a wide range of beers, spirits and soft drinks available

'Keeping the family together, that's my main aim. I thought I'd have somewhere to go to where I can play pool, put the music and karaoke on.'

Darren also plans on kitting the 'fantastic' space out with an ice machine, microwave, beer kegs and chiller pumps as well as wrap around furniture for the outdoor area.

The operations manager, who loves hosting, said that as soon as restrictions allow he hopes to use the mancave for team meetings and also 'can't wait' to throw a works do too.

Darren said: 'I think they'll thoroughly enjoy it as we've been locked down for so long - I've already got at least 40-50 people who've already accepted the invite, it's going to be massive.

'I love being behind that bar - I love singing and mixing with people - I love everything like that.

'When people come around we're going to have a BBQ outside, karaoke parties in the garden with chefs doing all the cooking - it's just one great big fun area.

'I've got a load of pumps in there, most of them are for show, but there will be larger and cider hooked up once we're out of lockdown - I can't wait to pour a pint for 30 people.'

The 60-year-old's incredible project has gone viral and he's been inundated with messages from admirers across the globe who've all been commenting on how amazing his creation is.

Darren said: 'I just wanted to put it on there [LinkedIn] for my work colleagues to see - and it's just soared.

'So many people have asked where I got stuff from and if I've got any papers with all the design, construction and architecture.

'It was just a dream in my head and I told the builders what I wanted - I had a vision of what it was going to look like and got it built - there was no plans or nothing.

'From something I wanted to do for many different reasons, it's blown into a fantastic area and I can't wait for the summer.'",MailOnline,"['families', 'pub', 'pubs', 'machine', 'gardens', 'pool', 'lockdown', 'family', 'beer', 'going', 'garden', 'bar', 'pictured', 'build', 'homes']",0
2021-02-17 16:30:09+00:00,12,"Three genes inherited from Neanderthals slash the risk of severe Covid-19 by 22 per cent, a new study has revealed.

The genes sit next to each other on chromosome 12, and this large chunk of genetic material includes 75,000 individual pieces of DNA.

Researchers compared the DNA of 2,200 Covid-19 patients from around the world with the genes of three Neanderthals that lived 50,000, 70,000 and 120,000 years ago.

They found people with Neanderthal versions of the genes OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 were less likely to develop severe symptoms after infection with the coronavirus.

These genes produce enzymes which specifically target invading RNA viruses, and the Neanderthal version is thought to be more potent.

Previous research has found eight genetic locations spread across five chromosomes (3, 6, 12, 19 and 21) which are 'associated with risk of requiring intensive care upon SARS-CoV-2 infection'. However, the new analysis shows only those found at chromosome 3 and 12 come from Neanderthals (pictured). Chromosome 12 contains three genes which help fight Covi and slash risk of severe infection by 22%

Professor Hugo Zeberg and Dr Svante Pääbo from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, respectively, conducted the study.

Previous research has found eight genetic locations spread across five chromosomes (3, 6, 12, 19 and 21) which are 'associated with risk of requiring intensive care upon SARS-CoV-2 infection'.

However, the new analysis shows only those found at chromosome 3 and 12 originate from cross-species trysts between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.

Researchers compared the DNA of 2,200 Covid-19 patients from around the world with the genomes of three Neanderthals that lived 50,000, 70,000 and 120,000 years ago. They found people with neanderthal versions of the genes OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 were less likely to develop severe symptoms after infection with the coronavirus

The chromosome 3 gene was the subject of previous research from the same team of experts.

It revealed the Neanderthal version, which is present in around one in eight people today, actually doubles the risk of needing intensive care if a person catches Covid.

But the stretch of Neanderthal DNA on chromosome 12 is more common.

It was present in around one in ten humans that lived more than 20,000 years ago, and then increased to around 15 per cent up to 10,000 years ago.

The researchers estimate it continued to become more dominant, with around a third of people who lived between 3,000 and 1,000 years ago having it.

Pictured, a world map showing the percentage of people who have the Neanderthal versions of the OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 genes (red portions of pie charts). Due to the ancient migratory patterns of Neanderthals and the fact they sparsely inhabited Africa before going extinct, very little Neanderthal DNA is seen in people living in sub-Saharan Africa today

Five genes make you more likely to die from coronavirus or be admitted to ICU Five genes identified by the University of Edinburgh increase the likelihood of a Covid-19 patient being admitted to intensive care and dying. A landmark study published in December gathered DNA from 2,700 Covid-19 patients in 208 intensive care units across the UK. These are the most severe cases of Covid, and 22 per cent of patients studied died, with 74 per cent unable to breathe on their own and needing mechanical ventilation. The genetic information of these patients was compared to 100,000 anonymous Britons, and five genes emerged as being extremely common in severe Covid cases. Researchers say the discovery of five genes that appear so clearly to be linked to the disease is unprecedented in the field. Knowing which genes are involved in severe cases of coronavirus infection can help scientists identify pre-existing drugs that could help treat Covid, the researchers say. The genes were identified across the genome, with two on chromosome 19 called TYK2 and DPP9. One, called IFNAR2, is found on chromosome 21. CCR2 is a gene found on chromosome four and OAS1 is located on the twelfth chromosome. Advertisement

'Intriguingly, the current allele frequency in Eurasia is around 30 per cent, suggesting that the Neandertal haplotype may have increased in frequency relatively recently,' the researchers write in their paper.

They add: 'It is present in populations in Eurasia and the Americas at carrier frequencies that often reach and exceed 50 per cent.'

Dr Pääbo says it is 'striking' that two Neanderthal variants can have such drastically different impacts on human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

'This shows that our heritage from Neanderthals is a double-edged sword when it comes to our response to SARS-CoV-2,' adds Professor Zeberg.

The researchers believe the location of the Neanderthal DNA on chromosome 12 is key, as it includes three genes (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3) which play a critical role in fighting infection.

Specifically, they help produce enzymes which target and destroy invasive RNA, such as SARS-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19.

The new research, published in the journal PNAS, also found the Neanderthal variant makes more virus-fighting enzymes than the ancestral Homo sapien alternative.

'One may speculate that, when modern humans encountered new RNA viruses outside Africa, the higher enzymatic activity of the ancestral variants that they acquired through genetic interactions with Neandertals may have been advantageous,' the researchers write.

'Intriguingly, there is evidence that the Neanderthal-like OAS haplotype may have recently increased in frequency in Eurasia, suggesting that selection may have positively affected the Neandertal-derived OAS locus in the last millennium.'

Due to the ancient migratory patterns of Neanderthals and the fact they sparsely inhabited Africa before going extinct, very little Neanderthal DNA is seen in people living in sub-Saharan Africa today.

In fact, the researchers say the Neanderthal Covid-fighting genes are 'almost completely absent' from these populations.

'In the Americas, it occurs in lower frequencies in some populations of African ancestry, presumably due to gene flow from populations of European or Native American ancestry,' they add in the paper.

The latest study backs up previous findings from a separate team of researchers from Canada, which also came to the conclusion the OAS1 gene reduces the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.

Although they did not look at the gene's origin, they did find five genes which increase the odds of severe infection.

Four of these genes — TYK2 and DPP9 on chromosome 19; IFNAR on chromosome 21 and OAS on chromosome 12 — were also studied by the latest study.",MailOnline,"['stretch', 'genes', 'slashes', 'researchers', 'neanderthals', '12', 'severe', 'illness', 'covid', 'dna', 'chromosome', 'cent', '22', 'risk', 'neanderthal']",0

Taiwan's health minister said on Wednesday that the island's plans to purchase the coronavirus vaccine, BioNTech SE, are now on hold, citing potential political pressure from Beijing for the delay.

The announcement comes at a time that tensions between the two sides have reached boiling point in recent months as they clashed over a range of issues including territorial disputes, the pandemic and human rights.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly sparred with the self-ruled island over the coronavirus pandemic.

Taiwan has been angered by China's assertion only it can speak for the island on the international stage about the subject, while Taiwan has accused China of lack of transparency.

Taiwan announced late in December said it had agreed to buy almost 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, including 10 million from UK drugmaker AstraZeneca, with the rest coming from the COVAX global vaccine programme and an unnamed company.

On Wednesday, Taiwan's Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said officials were on the verge of announcing the vaccine deal with BioNTech in December when the German firm pulled the plug.

While he did not directly say China was to blame, Chen implied there was a political dimension to the decision and that he had been worried about 'outside forces intervening', hence his caution in discussing the planned deal publicly.

'Certain people don't want Taiwan to be too happy,' he added, without elaborating, in a radio interview.

In return it agreed to pay up to $85 million (£61 million) in licensing fees and invest $50 million (£36 million) for a stake in the German firm.

2021-02-16 20:30:06+00:00,10,"From a dry cough to a high fever, coronavirus is known to be linked to a range of unpleasant symptoms.

Now, a new study has revealed another potential side effect - nodules on the eyeballs.

Researchers have warned that coronavirus infection may trigger inflammation of the eyeballs and lead to the formation of mysterious nodules at the back of the organ.

Experts do not yet know what causes these nodules or the impact they have on a patient's long-term health.

However, a study of 129 French patients who had severe Covid-19 and underwent MRI scans revealed nine of them (seven per cent) suffered abnormalities.

He was on a ventilator and in the prone position. This photo shows nodules at the back of the eyeball in the macular region (white arrowhead) and the extramacular region (black arrowhead). The arrow on the right points out a detached retina

Eight of the patients in the study were at some point treated in intensive care.

'We showed that a few patients with severe COVID-19 from the French COVID-19 cohort had one or several nodules of the posterior pole of the globe,' said study lead author Dr Augustin Lecler from the University of Paris.

'This is the first time these findings have been described using MRI.'

The images produced by the MRI reveal at least one nodule on the macular region of the organ in afflicted individuals. This region is integral to central vision.

Researchers believe the nodules could be linked with inflammation triggered by the virus, a common manifestation of the disease which attacks several organs.

Pictured, another MRI image from the same 56-year-old French Covid patient, the black arrowhead shows a nodule in the extramacular region of the sight organ. Experts do not yet know what causes or the impact they have on the patient's long-term health

Scientists investigate whether coronavirus patients with neurological symptoms are affected long-term The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19 is known to infect the brain and affect the body's network of neurons. Now scientists are investigating the long-term impact of these symptoms, to see if the virus causes enduring neurological damage. Researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden are following the progress of 19 individuals who caught the virus last year and developed neurological symptoms. Disease severity in the cohort varied from mild to critical and all the participants recovered, with symptoms ranging from delirium to a coma. Eight people in the study (42 per cent) had 'altered mental status' and eight also had headaches as a result of their Covid-19. Advertisement

But they also theorise the problem could be caused by patients lying on their fronts in hospital in the prone position which inadvertently prevents veins from draining.

Of the nine patients with eye nodules, two had diabetes, six were obese and two had hypertension.

The team behind the finding also speculate the nodules could be connected to intubation for ventilation.

'Our study advocates for screening of all patients hospitalized in the ICU for severe COVID-19,' Dr. Lecler said.

'We believe those patients should receive specific eye-protective treatments.'

The researchers are performing follow-up clinical and MRI examinations in the survivors to monitor the nodules and see if they carry any clinical consequences such as vision loss or visual field impairment.

They are also performing MRI exams in new patients with severe COVID-19 from the second and third waves of the pandemic, using more rigorous tests.

Meanwhile, the effects on patients with moderate Covid are currently under investigation.

Dr Lecler added: 'We have launched a prospective study with dedicated high-resolution images for exploring the eye and orbit in patients with light to moderate Covid.

'Therefore, we will be able to know whether our findings were specific to severe Covid patients or not.'

The Navy said the three sailors have not had any symptoms, and they and others who were exposed to them are currently isolated on the aircraft carrier, which is conducting operations in the Pacific. They tested positive Sunday.

In a statement, the Navy said it is 'following an aggressive mitigation strategy,' including masks, social distancing, and proper handwashing and hygiene measures.

'U.S. Pacific Fleet is committed to taking every measure possible to protect the health of our force,' the fleet said in the statement.

The outbreak on the ship last year was the largest the military has seen so far, with more than 1,000 sailors testing positive.

One sailor died. Eventually all of the 4,800 crew members were sent ashore in Guam for weeks of quarantine, in a systematic progression that kept enough sailors on the ship to keep it secure and running.

The failure of the ship's leaders to properly handle the outbreak exploded into one of the biggest military leadership crises in recent years.

The ship's captain Brett Crozier, who pleaded for faster action to protect his crew from the rapidly spreading virus, was fired and the one-star admiral on the ship had his promotion delayed.

Adm. Mike Gilday, the chief of naval operations, concluded after a lengthy review that both men made serious errors in judgment.

The carrier returned to duty about three months after it docked in Guam and then returned home to the West Coast.

Other ships that have been underway or at their home ports over the past year have had smaller numbers of sailors test positive, but none have had such a major outbreak.

The suspect, Kong, and his team made a profit of 18 million yuan (£2 million) by passing off saline solution or mineral water as counterfeit coronavirus vaccines.

At least 70 people have been arrested in China over the production and distribution of fake coronavirus vaccines, price gouging and illegal inoculations.

The 70 suspects were arrested in 21 vaccine-related cases, authorities said, many of which surfaced during the initial phases of coronavirus vaccine rollout last year.

The group led by Kong made a profit of about 18 million yuan (£2 million) by putting saline solution or mineral water in 58,000 doses of the spurious vaccines since August last year.

The 33-year-old leader and his two partners then packaged the products with similar designs of real coronavirus vaccines.

One batch of 600 fake vaccines produced by the group was sent to Hong Kong last November, before they were shipped abroad. It remains unclear where they were sent to.

The suspects were arrested last Christmas Day, according to an official statement on Wednesday.

In other cases, fake vaccines were sold at high prices, included in emergency inoculation schemes at hospitals, or smuggled abroad, it added.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate, China's highest prosecuting body, has urged regional officials to cooperate with the police in swift and unwavering action to curb such activities.

China, which had given 40.52 million doses of vaccine to key groups of people by Tuesday, has largely managed to bring the pandemic under control with strict lockdown, testing and tracing measures.

Officials had hoped to administer 100 million Covid doses before the Lunar New Year last week, but only 40 million people had been inoculated so far.

The news comes as a shipment of a COVID-19 vaccine produced in China arrived in Hungary Tuesday morning, making the country the first in the European Union to receive a Chinese vaccine.

Workers stand near the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines from China unloaded from an Air Zimbabwe aircraft at Robert Gabriel Mugabe airport in Harare, Zimbabwe, on Monday

A jet carrying 550,000 doses of the vaccine, developed by the Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm, landed in Budapest after flying from Beijing.

The shipment is enough to treat 275,000 people with the two-dose vaccine, head of the Epidemiology Department of the National Public Health Center, Dr. Agnes Galgoczy, said at a press conference.

Hungary expects to receive 5 million total doses of the Sinopharm vaccine over the next four months. The country has sought to purchase vaccines from countries outside the EU's common procurement program, claiming that delays in the bloc's rollout is costing lives.

The Sinopharm vaccine, which the developer says is nearly 80 per cent effective, is already in use in Hungary's non-EU neighbor Serbia, where around half a million ethnic Hungarians have already received the jab.

China reported 16 new coronavirus cases today, compared to nine a day earlier.

All the cases were imported infections originating overseas, and there was no new death or new suspected cases reported, the National Health Commission said in a statement.

There were 11 new asymptomatic infections, which China does not classify as confirmed Covid-19 cases, versus 10 a day earlier.

China saw a resurgence of the disease in January, when a new cluster emerged in Hebei and later took hold in northeastern Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, in the country's worst outbreak since March.

Authorities in these provinces introduced lockdowns, travel curbs and mass testing in a bid to contain the disease.

Data from recent days suggests that China has been able to avoid another full-blown Covid-19 crisis over the Lunar New Year holiday.

Researchers analyzed dozens of breast milk samples and found none to contain any bits of viral genetic material.

However, they found infants do receive 'milk-borne' antibodies that can neutralize the coronavirus.

The team, from the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, says the findings provide evidence for why COVID-19 positive women should not be separated from their newborns.

None of the samples contained genetic material of the virus or antigens, which are proteins found on the surface of the virus, but nearly two-thirds of the samples contained two antibodies specific to the coronavirus (above)

While scientists have long believed that 'breast is best' when it comes to feeding newborns, there were many questions surrounding the benefits and potential risks are still unanswered.

Limited research has been conducted on this topic up to this point, but the results have been mixed.

Some studies have found no virus in human milk while others have detected viral RNA in just certain milk samples.

Additionally, researchers wanted to know if antibodies can be found in breast milk and, if so, can protect babies from developing COVID-19.

'We only want to sequester a mother from her baby if it's medically necessary,' said co-investigator Dr Bridget Young, assistant professor in the pediatrics department at URMC, in a press release.

'However, the issue was very confusing for practitioners who don't have sufficient evidence.

'These early results suggest that breast milk from mothers who have had a COVID-19 infection contains specific and active antibodies against the virus, and that they do not transfer the virus through milk. This is great news!'

For the study, published in published in mBio, the team looked at 37 samples of breast milk submitted by 18 women who had been diagnosed with COVID-19.

None of the samples they looked at contain genetic material of the virus or antigens, which are proteins found on the surface of the virus.

However, they found that nearly two-thirds of the samples contained two antibodies specific to the coronavirus.

2021-02-16 02:46:06+00:00,25,"China took the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins, a new investigation has found.

Among powerful forces around the world, Beijing's propaganda machines played a key role in churning out conspiracies about the coronavirus originating from other countries, according to a nine-month investigation by Associated Press.

Leading media and officials in Russia, Iran and the US – including Donald Trump – also ramped up politically motivated false claims in a global race to control the narrative about where the virus came from, the report said.

China took the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins, a new investigation has found. In this file photo taken on February 6, 2020, medical workers transfer a coronavirus patient in the isolation ward at a hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province

It took just three months for the rumour that COVID-19 was engineered as a bioweapon to spread from the fringes of the Chinese internet and take root in millions of people´s minds.

By March 2020, belief that the virus had been human-made and possibly weaponised was widespread, multiple surveys indicated.

The Pew Research Center found, for example, that one in three Americans believed the new coronavirus had been created in a lab; one in four thought it had been engineered intentionally.

This chaos was, at least in part, manufactured, according to a nine-month Associated Press investigation of state-sponsored disinformation conducted in collaboration with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.

Powerful forces, from Beijing and Washington to Moscow and Tehran, have battled to control the narrative about where the virus came from.

As the pandemic swept the world, it was China that took the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins.

Coronavirus DID start in China and 'exploded' at a Wuhan wet market after spreading from bats - despite Beijing's claim it could have arrived on frozen Australian beef, WHO scientist says The coronavirus pandemic started in China and 'exploded' at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, an Australian scientist investigating the origins of the pandemic claims. Professor Dominic Dwyer was one of 14 scientists who travelled to China over the past month in a World Health Organisation investigation into the virus that has killed 2.3 million people around the world. On Tuesday many were shocked to hear the leader of the WHO team, Peter Embarek, echo Communist Party's assertions that frozen food imports, such as Australian beef, could have led to the initial outbreak. However, Prof Dwyer, a microbiologist and infectious diseases expert, broke ranks with those claims, saying the source of the virus was most likely bats as previously suspected. 'The evidence for it starting elsewhere in the world is actually very limited. There is some evidence but it's not really very good,' he told Nine News.

Leading officials and allied media in all four countries functioned as super-spreaders of disinformation, using their stature to sow doubt and amplify politically expedient conspiracies already in circulation.

The analysis was based on a review of millions of social media postings and articles on Twitter, Facebook, VK, Weibo, WeChat, YouTube, Telegram, and other platforms.

Beijing was reacting to weeks of fiery rhetoric from leading U.S. Republicans, including then-President Donald Trump, who sought to rebrand COVID-19 as 'the China virus.'

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says Beijing has worked to promote friendship and serve facts, while defending itself against hostile forces seeking to politicise the pandemic.

'All parties should firmly say 'no' to the dissemination of disinformation,' the ministry said in a statement to AP, but added, 'In the face of trumped-up charges, it is justified and proper to bust lies and clarify rumours by setting out the facts.'

The day after the World Health Organization designated the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), shot off a series of late-night tweets that launched what may be the party's first truly global digital experiment with overt disinformation.

Chinese diplomats have only recently mobilised on Western social media platforms, more than tripling their Twitter accounts and more than doubling their Facebook accounts since late 2019. Both platforms are banned in China.

'When did patient zero begin in US?' Zhao tweeted on March 12. 'How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe (sic) us an explanation!'

What happened next showcases the power of China's global messaging machine.

On Twitter alone, Zhao's aggressive spray of 11 tweets on March 12 and 13 was cited over 99,000 times over the next six weeks, in at least 54 languages, according to analysis conducted by DFRLab.

The accounts that referenced him had nearly 275 million followers on Twitter - a number that almost certainly includes duplicate followers and does not distinguish fake accounts.

Multiple countries have uncovered evidence that the virus was circulating months earlier than originally thought. While Beijing has tried to insist this proves the virus originated elsewhere, most scientists still think China was the origin - raising the prospect that communist officials simply hid evidence of the early spread

Influential conservatives on Twitter, including Donald Trump Jr., hammered Zhao, propelling his tweets to their largest audiences.

China's Global Times and at least 30 Chinese diplomatic accounts, from France to Panama, rushed in to support Zhao.

Venezuela's foreign minister and RT's correspondent in Caracas, as well as Saudi accounts close to the kingdom's royal family also significantly extended Zhao's reach, helping launch his ideas into Spanish and Arabic.

His accusations got uncritical treatment in Russian and Iranian state media and shot back through QAnon discussion boards. But his biggest audience, by far, lay within China itself - despite the fact that Twitter is banned there.

Popular hashtags about his tweet-storm were viewed 314 million times on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, which does not distinguish unique views.

Late on the night of March 13, Zhao posted a message of gratitude on his personal Weibo: 'Thank you for your support to me, let us work hard for the motherland !'

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

China leaned on Russian disinformation strategy and infrastructure, turning to an established network of Kremlin proxies to seed and spread messaging.

In January, Russian state media were the first to legitimise the theory that the US engineered the virus as a weapon. Russian politicians soon joined the chorus.

'One was amplifying the other... How much it was command controlled, how much it was opportunistic, it was hard to tell,' said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, based in Riga, Latvia.

Iran also jumped in. The same day Zhao tweeted that the virus might have come from the US Army, Iran´s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced COVID-19 could be the result of a biological attack. He would later cite that conspiracy to justify refusing COVID-19 aid from the US

Ten days after Zhao's first conspiratorial tweets, China's global state media apparatus kicked in.

'Did the U.S. government intentionally conceal the reality of COVID-19 with the flu?' asked a suggestive op-ed in Mandarin published by China Radio International on March 22.

'Why was the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Ft. Detrick in Maryland, the largest biochemical testing base, shut down in July 2019?'

Within days, versions of the piece appeared more than 350 times in Chinese state outlets, mostly in Mandarin, but also around the world in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Arabic, AP found.

China's Embassy in France promoted the story on Twitter and Facebook. It appeared on YouTube, Weibo, WeChat and a host of Chinese video platforms, including Haokan, Xigua, Baijiahao, Bilibili, iQIYI, Kuaishou and Youku.

A seven-second version set to driving music appeared on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.

'Clearly pushing these kinds of conspiracy theories, disinformation, does not usually result in any negative consequences for them,' said Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow in the Asia Program of the German Marshall Fund.

In April, Russia and Iran largely dropped the bioweapon conspiracy in their overt messaging.

China, however, has carried on.

In January, as a team from the World Health Organization poured through records in China to try to pinpoint the origins of the virus, MOFA spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged the US to 'open the biological lab at Fort Detrick, give more transparency to issues like its 200-plus overseas bio-labs, invite WHO experts to conduct origin-tracing in the United States.'

Her remarks went viral in China.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AP it resolutely opposes spreading conspiracy theories. 'We have not done it before and will not do it in the future,' the ministry said in a statement.

The increased humidity in the air between a person's mouth and their mask is believed to help the wearer's body remove viral particles from the airways.

Experts from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) found the mask-induced humidity hydrates the respiratory tract and allows infected mucus to be cleared, preventing it reaching the lungs where it can cause damage and lead to severe cases of Covid.

Four masks were tested to investigate how they impacted on the level of humidity. A volunteer exhaled into a 95.3 litre box (pictured) while wearing either: no mask, a N95 mask, a surgical mask, a two-ply cotton-polyester mask, and a heavy cotton mask

The NIH team set out to learn more about previous research which found people who wear masks often have less severe forms of Covid-19.

Dr Adriaan Bax, lead author of the new study, said: 'High levels of humidity have been shown to mitigate severity of the flu, and it may be applicable to severity of COVID-19 through a similar mechanism.'

Temperature, humidity and wind could be used to predict another wave of coronavirus Air temperature and humidity play a key role in determining when and where a second wave of the pandemic will strike, new research shows. Researchers say current forecasting models only take into account two factors - rate of transmission and recovery. But by including data on humidity and temperature, researchers from Cyprus have been able to add a level of nuance that allows for more accurate forecasting. 'The results suggest that two pandemic outbreaks per year are inevitable because they are directly linked to what we call weather seasonality,' the researchers write in their study. Advertisement

Any leakage around the edges of the mask was eliminated by fitting high-density rubber foam around the mask and to the volunteer's face.

The water content in the air was measured in each instance to reveal how much water is trapped by the mask.

Humidity readings were taken at three temperatures: 8ºC, 22ºC, and 37ºC.

'The ability of various types of synthetic and natural fibers to absorb water depends strongly on temperature,' the authors write in the paper.

'Natural fibers such as wool, cotton, and silk are particularly effective at absorbing water, whereas synthetic polyester or nylon fibers do so to a much lesser extent.'

Every mask increased humidity, but to varying extents.

At room temperature, the surgical mask increased the humidity of inhaled air by more than a third (38 per cent), whereas the N95 and polyester-cotton coverings increased the water content of inhaled air by up to 60 per cent.

Heavy cotton masks, the researchers found, led to an almost doubling of inhaled air humidity.

'The increased level of humidity is something most mask-wearers probably felt without being able to recognize, and without realising that this humidity might actually be good for them,' Dr Bax said.

'Even as more people nationwide begin to get vaccinated, we must remain vigilant about doing our part to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19,' added Dr Griffin Rodgers, director of the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

2021-02-15 14:00:11+00:00,9,"China took the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins, a new investigation has found.

Among powerful forces around the world, Beijing's propaganda machines played a key role in churning out conspiracies about the coronavirus originating from other countries, according to a nine-month investigation by Associated Press.

Leading media and officials in Russia, Iran and the US – including Donald Trump – also ramped up politically motivated false claims in a global race to control the narrative about where the virus came from, the report said.

China took the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins, a new investigation has found. In this file photo taken on February 6, 2020, medical workers transfer a coronavirus patient in the isolation ward at a hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province

It took just three months for the rumour that COVID-19 was engineered as a bioweapon to spread from the fringes of the Chinese internet and take root in millions of people´s minds.

By March 2020, belief that the virus had been human-made and possibly weaponised was widespread, multiple surveys indicated.

The Pew Research Center found, for example, that one in three Americans believed the new coronavirus had been created in a lab; one in four thought it had been engineered intentionally.

This chaos was, at least in part, manufactured, according to a nine-month Associated Press investigation of state-sponsored disinformation conducted in collaboration with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.

Powerful forces, from Beijing and Washington to Moscow and Tehran, have battled to control the narrative about where the virus came from.

As the pandemic swept the world, it was China that took the lead in spreading foreign disinformation about COVID-19's origins.

Coronavirus DID start in China and 'exploded' at a Wuhan wet market after spreading from bats - despite Beijing's claim it could have arrived on frozen Australian beef, WHO scientist says The coronavirus pandemic started in China and 'exploded' at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, an Australian scientist investigating the origins of the pandemic claims. Professor Dominic Dwyer was one of 14 scientists who travelled to China over the past month in a World Health Organisation investigation into the virus that has killed 2.3 million people around the world. On Tuesday many were shocked to hear the leader of the WHO team, Peter Embarek, echo Communist Party's assertions that frozen food imports, such as Australian beef, could have led to the initial outbreak. However, Prof Dwyer, a microbiologist and infectious diseases expert, broke ranks with those claims, saying the source of the virus was most likely bats as previously suspected. 'The evidence for it starting elsewhere in the world is actually very limited. There is some evidence but it's not really very good,' he told Nine News. 'We know that other viruses that are closely related to [Covid-19] are present in bats. We know that other viruses like MERS and SARS back in 2003 also came from bats.

2021-02-15 12:30:04+00:00,4,"The Duke of Cambridge has paid tribute to a 'much loved' nurse who died after contracting Covid-19 as he urged NHS executives to speak out about mental health.

Prince William, 38, passed on his condolences after Estrella Catalan, 52, died earlier this month at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) where she had worked for 18 years.

The duke's words of sympathy came when he joined the weekly meeting of the East of England's NHS leadership, and he highlighted the importance of health bosses talking about mental wellbeing to encourage their workforce to 'feel emboldened and inspired to also take it seriously'.

He also said the nation faced a 'very big waterfall of mental health issues' in the future and asked the executives about their own wellbeing.

Speaking during the video meeting held on Wednesday, he said: 'I also want to just sort of pass on my thoughts to all of you and your teams about Estrella Catalan, who I believe was a much loved member of most of your teams and had been in the region for a long time at I think King's Lynn and N and N (Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital).

The Duke of Cambridge (pictured), 38, has paid tribute to a 'much loved' nurse who died after contracting Covid-19 as he urged NHS executives to speak out about mental health

Ms Catalan (pictured( was a staff nurse on the Gunthorpe and Heydon wards, as well as the emergency department and acute stroke team

'And I imagine that's hit everyone very hard so I'm very sorry to hear that, and my thoughts from my family are all with all of you who knew her and her family.'

In moving scenes, Mrs Catalan was interviewed from her hospital bed last month by the BBC and cried as she explained she only wanted to return to her patients: 'I want to help. But I don't know when.

'I don't mind working and doing even extra shifts to help the trust, but I'm here as a patient. I'm helpless.'

Ann Radmore, regional director of NHS England and NHS Improvement – East of England, led the meeting of around 35 senior NHS leaders who included Sam Higginson, chief executive of the NNUH where the nurse worked.

After the meeting, she said about the duke: 'He mentioned her death to us, and I think that was very appropriate and helpful actually, because she was a much loved member of staff over in Norfolk.'

William worked as a helicopter pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance ending his two-year stint in 2017 and is likely to have ferried patients to the NNUH, but had not met the nurse.

Estrella Catalan (right), 52, died after weeks in the critical care unit of Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, where she had worked since September 2002

The hospital took to Twitter to express their 'great sadness' following the loss of Estrella (pictured)

He paid tribute to the NHS staff he had worked alongside, saying he held them in 'high esteem' and told everyone at the meeting they were performing a 'brilliant, brilliant job'.

Ms Catalan, believed to be originally from the Philippines, joined the Norwich-based trust in September 2002 and worked as a staff nurse on the Gunthorpe and Heydon wards, and with the emergency department and acute stroke team.

According to a GoFundMe page created in her honour, which has raised more than £35,000 for her family, Mrs Catalan is survived by her husband Melvin and their sons John and Josh – adding that her eldest son Vince died two years ago.

William voiced his concerns about the mental health support for executives around the virtual table when he inquired 'who's asking you how you're doing?', and speculated it was probably 'quite difficult' to find the time to ask after each other during a busy video conference.

A GoFundMe page has raised more than £21,031 for funeral expenses and financial support for the family, and describes her as a 'caring, conscientious and hard-working person'

After the private meeting, during which the duke was told about initiatives to support the mental wellbeing of NHS staff and patients, he said:

'I'm pleased to hear the mental health processes are taken very seriously and as I said at the beginning, anything that you as CEOs can do to share your concerns, worries, mental health – whether positive, whether poor – would be a really big thing as well after this.

'You know, it leads from the top down as well as the bottom up. And so if any of you can shed light or be involved in that, it really opens the door that allows your workforce to feel emboldened and inspired to also take it seriously.'

The duke also said: 'As you know I'm trying to champion, trying to tackle the taboo and the stigma around mental health and my conversations so far up and down the country with your colleagues in the NHS has starkly shown – as Ann pointed out – we're facing a very big waterfall of mental health issues coming up.'

Expanding on the the Duke's 'waterfall' comment, Ms Radmore, speaking after the call, said for patients the pandemic will have 'exacerbated some people's mental health problems, and may have created some new mental health problems'.

While NHS staff will have been through an 'incredibly battering process' and the aim was to help them understand and articulate what has happened as part of their recovery, and then move forward.",MailOnline,"['prince', 'died', 'health', 'meeting', 'worked', 'nhs', 'catalan', 'nurse', 'staff', 'duke', 'loved', 'offers', 'dies', 'covid19', 'condolences', 'mental', 'william', 'filipino']",0
2021-02-15 02:02:03+00:00,11,"The virus which causes Covid-19 may not have emerged in China, a World Health Organisation (WHO) scientist today suggested after the fact-finding mission to Wuhan dismissed theories it leaked from a lab.

Professor John Watson, who was part of the WHO team that travelled to China to investigate the origins of the pandemic, said the virus's leap from animals to humans may have occurred outside the country's borders.

England's former Deputy Chief Medical Officer told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show this morning that the pandemic most likely started with an infection in an 'animal reservoir' which was then passed on to humans through an 'intermediate host'.

Asked if he was sure the virus emerged in China, Prof Watson said 'no' - adding that fact-finders 'need to ensure that we are looking beyond the borders of China, as well as within China'.

WHO critics are likely to claim the bombshell interview gives further backing to Beijing's explanations for the source of the virus and is another PR coup for the ruling Communist Party, which has repeatedly tried to pin the blame for the outbreak outside its borders.

It will also give ammunition to critics who fear the investigation would be used to give legitimacy to a Chinese white-washing exercise with possibly embarrassing or incriminating evidence hidden from investigators.

Professor John Watson, who was part of the WHO team that travelled to China to investigate the origins of the pandemic, said the virus's leap from animals to humans may have occurred outside the country's borders

Dr Embarek said his team has ruled out the possibility that the virus leaked from a lab such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology (pictured), saying such a leak is 'extremely unlikely' and should not be investigated further

Security personnel keep watch outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organisation in Wuhan, Hubei province

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratory? The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been collecting numerous coronaviruses from bats ever since the SARS outbreak in 2002. They have also published papers describing how these bat viruses have interacted with human cells. US Embassy staff visited the lab in 2018 and 'had grave safety concerns' over the protocols which were being observed at the facility. The lab is just eight miles from the Huanan wet market which is where the first cluster of infections erupted in Wuhan. The market is just a few hundred yards from another lab called the Wuhan Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (WHCDC). The WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in its labs, including some 605 bats. Those who support the theory argue that Covid-19 could have leaked from either or both of these facilities and spread to the wet market. Most argue that this would have been a virus they were studying rather than one which was engineered. Last year a bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology recounted how bats once attacked a researcher at the WHCDC and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat).' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out within 300 yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' Advertisement

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday the Washington government had 'deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them'.

And British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK shared 'concerns' that scientists would 'get full co-operation and they get the answers they need'.

Speaking to the BBC today, Prof Watson said: 'I think that there are all sorts of reasons to do with the way it did start in the outbreak in Wuhan and the various bits of information about the way in which these viruses live in different animal reservoirs, that suggest that China is a very, very possible source for the outbreak, but by no means necessarily the place where the leap from animals to humans took place.

'And I think we need to ensure that we are looking beyond the borders of China, as well as within China.'

Asked if the WHO team was given access to the raw data about the first 174 people who contracted coronavirus in China, Prof Watson said they saw a 'great deal' of information about the cases. However, he added that the team was only given access to a 'certain amount' of the raw data.

Prof Watson said: 'We didn't see all of that and we didn't see the original questionnaires that were used, but apart from the fact that, of course, they would have been in Chinese, one has to think about what one would have seen if one had gone to any other country in the world.'

He said the team's visit was not a 'one-off' and that the WHO sees it as 'the start of a process that's going to take really quite a while'.

China has faced claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could be the suspected source of the Covid-19 virus.

However, the WHO team concluded it was 'extremely unlikely' to have entered the human population as a result of a laboratory-related incident.

Prof Watson said the possibility that it may have escaped from a laboratory had not been 'ruled out'.

Foreign Secretary Mr Raab told the Andrew Marr Show that the UK Government would be 'pushing' for China to provide full access to its data.

He said: 'We'll be pushing for it to have full access, get all the data it needs to be able to answer the questions that I think most people want to hear answered around the outbreak, the causes.

'And that's important, not for geopolitical point-scoring or anything like that, but so we can learn the lessons and prevent it ever happening again.'

It comes after Peter Embarek, leader of the WHO team, said that 'further research' into the imported meat theory being pushed by Beijing is needed, along with studies looking at early cases of Covid reported outside of China.

At the same time, he dismissed theories that the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, saying the possibility is 'extremely unlikely' and does not need to be investigated further - despite US government officials calling it 'the most credible' theory just a few weeks ago.

It is hardly the first time that the WHO has come under fire for parroting information from Beijing, with Donald Trump made the same allegations last year before pulling US funding - a move President Biden has pledged to reverse.

Dr Tedros, the WHO chief, has also come in for heavy criticism for his praise of China - describing its 'commitment to transparency' as 'beyond words' during the early stages of the outbreak, despite strong doubts about data coming from Beijing and a past history of covering up disease outbreaks.

It was also revealed that Dr Tedros received support from Beijing while in the running to become WHO chief, and that China has often donated large sums of money to governments or organisations that he has been a part of.



During his press conference, Dr Embarek also backed assertions from Beijing that there is no evidence of transmission 'in Wuhan or elsewhere' in China before December 2019 - despite multiple studies suggesting the virus was circulating globally months earlier than that.

Outlining the findings of his team's month-long fact-finding mission, Dr Embarek said the team had failed to establish where the virus came from or how it first jumped into humans. Instead, he said the team had come up with four theories about its origins.

Peter Embarek, lead researcher for WHO in Wuhan, has put forward four theories about how the virus infected humans: Direct transfer from source animal into people, transfer via an intermediary animal, transfer via food, and transfer via a lab leak

Coronavirus DID start in China and 'exploded' at a Wuhan wet market after spreading from bats - despite Beijing's claim it could have arrived on frozen Australian beef, WHO scientist says The coronavirus pandemic started in China and 'exploded' at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, an Australian scientist investigating the origins of the pandemic claims. Professor Dominic Dwyer was one of 14 scientists who travelled to China over the past month in a World Health Organisation investigation into the virus that has killed 2.3 million people around the world. On Tuesday many were shocked to hear the leader of the WHO team, Peter Embarek, echo Communist Party's assertions that frozen food imports, such as Australian beef, could have led to the initial outbreak. However, Prof Dwyer, a microbiologist and infectious diseases expert, broke ranks with those claims, saying the source of the virus was most likely bats as previously suspected. 'The evidence for it starting elsewhere in the world is actually very limited. There is some evidence but it's not really very good,' he told Nine News. 'We know that other viruses that are closely related to [Covid-19] are present in bats. We know that other viruses like MERS and SARS back in 2003 also came from bats. 'Now these bats don't respect borders of course so they are present not just in China but in other parts on South East Asia and indeed elsewhere around the world.' From bats the contagion probably transferred to an intermediate animal such as a pangolin or a cat - which are sold at the traditional Chinese exotic animal 'wet markets' as food. Advertisement

He said the most likely explanation is that the virus passed from its original host animal into an intermediary animal that comes into close contact with humans, before making the leap into people.

Intermediary animals could include frozen or chilled animal products sold at markets in Wuhan, including those imported from overseas, he said, outlining his second theory.

The next most-likely theory is that the virus jumped directly from its original host into humans, Dr Embarek said, putting forward bats as a likely source.

But, he said, humans and bats do not come into close contact in Wuhan and swabs of bats and various other animal species in China - including wild animals, pets, and farm animals - has failed to find the original source.

Dr Embarek called for more research to be carried out into all three of these theories, and said teams should be looking outside as well as inside of China's borders.

The only theory he rejected out-of-hand was that the virus had leaked from a lab, saying such an event was 'extremely unlikely'.

Dr Liang Wannian, the head of China's Wuhan research team, further agreed - claiming that there is no evidence that Covid was present at any facility in China before appearing in humans.

If the virus was not present in a lab before the outbreak then it could not have escaped, he said.

Dr Wannian instead pushed the theory - which has become prevalent in China in recent weeks - that frozen food could have been the source, saying his research shows Covid can survive for a long time at low temperatures.

This means that the virus could have travelled long distances to reach Wuhan, he added, without specifically saying that it came from overseas.

He further revealed that Huanan Seafood Market - the market where the first cluster of Covid cases was detected - was not the only market in the city to be hit by the infection.

'While some of the early cases had close association with Huanan Seafood Market, others were associated with other markets,' he said, 'and other cases have no market association at all.

'It is likely that Huanan Market acted as focus for virus transmission, but the virus was also transmitted elsewhere at the same time. It is not possible on basis of current information to establish how the virus was introduced into Hunan market.'

In fact, he claimed, the earliest confirmed case of Covid in Wuhan - which occurred on December 8 - had no connection to any market within the city.

He added that samples taken from early cases at Huanan market showed slight variations in the virus, implying that it had been present in humans for an unknown length of time before causing those infections.

Dr Embarek agreed, saying that the market played a role in the early spread but that it has not be possible to establish how the virus got into the market or how it spread through it.

The WHO findings will be a PR coup for Beijing and leader Xi Jingping (pictured shaking hands with WHO leader Dr Tedros) with diplomats repeatedly jumping on any evidence that the pandemic which has blighted the world did not start in China

Multiple countries have uncovered evidence that the virus was circulating months earlier than originally thought. While Beijing has tried to insist this proves the virus originated elsewhere, most scientists still think China was the origin - raising the prospect that communist officials simply hid evidence of the early spread

Facebook Covid 'misinformation' crackdown sparks freedom of speech fears Facebook will crack down on 'misinformation' about Covid-19, including claims that coronavirus was man-made, the tech giant has announced, sparking freedom of speech fears. The news comes despite the outbreak's source still not being identified, and after WHO scientists researching the origins of Covid in China said it is 'extremely unlikely' the virus leaked from a lab . Facebook said that it has banned misinformation about all vaccines in a blog pos t on Monday, after years of controversy over the company's perceived inaction. Some of the claims that Facebook said it would be clamping down on includes unproven claims that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured and that vaccines cause autism or have other harmful effects. Claims that vaccines are not effective against preventing disease and that it is safer to get the disease than to get a vaccine have also been banned from the platform. Posts making such claims will be removed from the website, as well as Facebook-owned Instagram, the company said in the post that came with a list of 'misinformation ' it was banning from its platforms. But Jim Killock, Executive Director of the Open Rights Group, expressed the need for Facebook to be cautious, saying there is a fine line between misinformation and content expressing people's genuine concerns. 'Facebook need to take action, but will inevitably make mistakes. They were recently told by their Oversight Board to reinstate a post relating to the COVID outbreak that was wrongly removed,' Mr Killock told the MailOnline. 'There is always a fine line between material that seeks to deceive, and people expressing legitimate concerns about their health. Facebook need to reassure the public that their rights to criticise and examine Government health policy will not be swept away by careless moderators.' The ban has taken effect immediately, with Facebook saying it is paying particular attention to 'Pages, groups and accounts that violate these rules'. Facebook added that it will be expanding its efforts to stop the spread of what it deems misinformation in the coming weeks. 'There's still a long road ahead, and in 2021 we're focused on supporting health leaders and public officials in their work to vaccinate billions of people against COVID-19,' Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook's head of health, said in a statement.

Putting forward other explanations for how the virus crossed into humans, Dr Wannian suggested that cats could have acted as an intermediary animal after cases were reported in felines around the world.

He also pointed to Covid infections in mink as evidence of another host animal, rather than bats or pangolins - both animals which are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and cooking.

He added that tens of thousands of PCR tests have been conducted on animals around China since the initial outbreak, including on domestically farmed animals, wild animals, and pets. All of the tests were negative, he said.

Marion Koopmans, another WHO scientist who was part of the team in China, further suggested that a rabbit, a bamboo rat or a ferret badger could have acted as the intermediary because all are susceptible to coronaviruses and some were present at the Huanan market in Wuhan.

The WHO mission has been fraught from the start, first beset by delays and roadblocks thrown up by the Chinese government, and then later by claims that scientists were being fed little more than propaganda by Beijing authorities.

The experts spent one month in China, two weeks in quarantine, and then just two weeks on actual fieldwork.

Journalists were kept at arms' length during the visit while no official itinerary was published - and what little information did leak out was not promising.

For example, it was revealed that scientists spent just an hour at the Huanan Seafood Market but found time to visit a propaganda exhibition celebrating China's recovery from the pandemic.

They also appeared to spend several days inside their hotel receiving visits from various Chinese officials without going out into the city.

Deeper research was carried out at the Wuhan virology institute where they spent nearly four hours and said they met with Chinese scientists there including Shi Zhengli, one of China's leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan lab.

Former US president Donald Trump repeated a controversial theory that a lab leak may have been the source of the pandemic.

Scientists at the laboratory conduct research on some of the world's most dangerous diseases, including strains of bat coronaviruses similar to Covid-19.

Beijing is desperate to defang criticism of its handling of the chaotic early stages of the outbreak.

It has refocused attention at home - and abroad - on its handling of, and recovery from the outbreak.

Meanwhile an AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and prevented scientists from speaking to reporters.

The WHO team's mission is intended to be an initial step delving into the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in bats before being passed to humans through another species of wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat, which is considered an exotic delicacy by some in China.

Transmission through the trade in frozen products has emerged as a recent theory and has since become prevalent in China, and it appears WHO investigators also leaned towards the possibility.

Another member of the WHO team told The Associated Press late last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.

That expert, British-born zoologist Peter Daszak, said the team looked into issues including what the first cases were, the link with animals and what, if any, the role that imports of frozen food may have played - a theory that China has long put forward.

The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate after China only agreed to it amid massive international pressure at the World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation.

While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal.

Summing up his time in China, Dr Embarek concluded: 'It was fascinating to realise that these people are not holding very exciting clues.

'When we talked to one of first cases, you immediately think they must have some very special habits, hiking in mountains, keeping wild pets at home, instead you realise they are very much like us - spending days on the internet, same jobs, activities and sports as many of us do.

'Illustrating how complicated this work is, it is not possible to come up with all answers after a few weeks of study.

'This needs to be done in a systematic way, building bit by bit to get answers, that is what we will continue to do with our Chinese colleagues.'",MailOnline,"['wuhan', 'pandemic', 'china', 'scientist', 'animals', 'bats', 'team', 'animal', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'market', 'emerged', 'humans', 'outbreak']",0
2021-02-14 23:11:03+00:00,23,"The virus which causes Covid-19 may not have emerged in China, a World Health Organisation (WHO) scientist today suggested after the fact-finding mission to Wuhan dismissed theories it leaked from a lab.

Professor John Watson, who was part of the WHO team that travelled to China to investigate the origins of the pandemic, said the virus's leap from animals to humans may have occurred outside the country's borders.

England's former Deputy Chief Medical Officer told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show this morning that the pandemic most likely started with an infection in an 'animal reservoir' which was then passed on to humans through an 'intermediate host'.

Asked if he was sure the virus emerged in China, Prof Watson said 'no' - adding that fact-finders 'need to ensure that we are looking beyond the borders of China, as well as within China'.

WHO critics are likely to claim the bombshell interview gives further backing to Beijing's explanations for the source of the virus and is another PR coup for the ruling Communist Party, which has repeatedly tried to pin the blame for the outbreak outside its borders.

It will also give ammunition to critics who fear the investigation would be used to give legitimacy to a Chinese white-washing exercise with possibly embarrassing or incriminating evidence hidden from investigators.

Professor John Watson, who was part of the WHO team that travelled to China to investigate the origins of the pandemic, said the virus's leap from animals to humans may have occurred outside the country's borders

Dr Embarek said his team has ruled out the possibility that the virus leaked from a lab such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology (pictured), saying such a leak is 'extremely unlikely' and should not be investigated further

Security personnel keep watch outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organisation in Wuhan, Hubei province

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratory? The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been collecting numerous coronaviruses from bats ever since the SARS outbreak in 2002. They have also published papers describing how these bat viruses have interacted with human cells. US Embassy staff visited the lab in 2018 and 'had grave safety concerns' over the protocols which were being observed at the facility. The lab is just eight miles from the Huanan wet market which is where the first cluster of infections erupted in Wuhan. The market is just a few hundred yards from another lab called the Wuhan Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (WHCDC). The WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in its labs, including some 605 bats. Those who support the theory argue that Covid-19 could have leaked from either or both of these facilities and spread to the wet market. Most argue that this would have been a virus they were studying rather than one which was engineered. Last year a bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology recounted how bats once attacked a researcher at the WHCDC and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat).' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out within 300 yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says.

2021-02-14 21:01:08+00:00,31,"The number of COVID-19 infections being reported in the United States continues to decrease, with the country seeing its lowest weekly case numbers since last October.

k. There were just over 650,00 new infections reported in the seven days to February 13, according to The COVID Tracking Project. That total represents a 22.3 percent decrease from the number reported last wee

Hospitalization rates have also deceased 15.7 percent from last week, while deaths are down 13.8 percent in the past seven days.

However, officials are cautioning that the country is not out of the clear yet. The numbers currently being reported are still far higher than they were during the spring and summer surges of 2020.

On Saturday, the United States reported 90,199 new COVID-19 cases and 2,303 additional deaths.

More than 27.5 million Americans have tested positive to the virus, and 483,926 have now died.

More than 137,000 of those deaths have occurred in the 44 days since January 1.

There were just over 650,00 new infections reported in the seven days to February 13, according to The COVID Tracking Project.

The number of COVID-19 infections being reported in the United States continues to decrease, with the country seeing its lowest weekly case numbers since last October. A COVID patient is seen being treated in an ICU bed in California earlier this week

Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 vaccinations being administered across the United States continues to increase slightly each day.

On Friday, 1.66 million Americans received a dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna shot, up slightly from the 1.6 million who received a jab the day before.

In comparison, on January 13, exactly one month ago, just 710,000 Americans received a COVID-19 vaccine injection.

On Saturday, officials stated that just over 37.1 million American have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

While that may sound like a large number, it represents just 11 percent of the population.

At the current rate, it take until this coming November to partially vaccinate 90 percent of Americans, according to the New York Times.

Meanwhile, Bill Gates' daughter, Jennifer Gates, is among those who received her first COVID-19 vaccination this week.

2021-02-14 15:24:07+00:00,11,"The virus which causes Covid-19 may not have emerged in China, a World Health Organisation (WHO) scientist today suggested after the fact-finding mission to Wuhan dismissed theories it leaked from a lab.

Professor John Watson, who was part of the WHO team that travelled to China to investigate the origins of the pandemic, said the virus's leap from animals to humans may have occurred outside the country's borders.

England's former Deputy Chief Medical Officer told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show this morning that the pandemic most likely started with an infection in an 'animal reservoir' which was then passed on to humans through an 'intermediate host'.

Asked if he was sure the virus emerged in China, Prof Watson said 'no' - adding that fact-finders 'need to ensure that we are looking beyond the borders of China, as well as within China'.

WHO critics are likely to claim the bombshell interview gives further backing to Beijing's explanations for the source of the virus and is another PR coup for the ruling Communist Party, which has repeatedly tried to pin the blame for the outbreak outside its borders.

It will also give ammunition to critics who fear the investigation would be used to give legitimacy to a Chinese white-washing exercise with possibly embarrassing or incriminating evidence hidden from investigators.

Professor John Watson, who was part of the WHO team that travelled to China to investigate the origins of the pandemic, said the virus's leap from animals to humans may have occurred outside the country's borders

Dr Embarek said his team has ruled out the possibility that the virus leaked from a lab such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology (pictured), saying such a leak is 'extremely unlikely' and should not be investigated further

Security personnel keep watch outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology during the visit by the World Health Organisation in Wuhan, Hubei province

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratory? The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been collecting numerous coronaviruses from bats ever since the SARS outbreak in 2002. They have also published papers describing how these bat viruses have interacted with human cells. US Embassy staff visited the lab in 2018 and 'had grave safety concerns' over the protocols which were being observed at the facility. The lab is just eight miles from the Huanan wet market which is where the first cluster of infections erupted in Wuhan. The market is just a few hundred yards from another lab called the Wuhan Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (WHCDC). The WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in its labs, including some 605 bats. Those who support the theory argue that Covid-19 could have leaked from either or both of these facilities and spread to the wet market. Most argue that this would have been a virus they were studying rather than one which was engineered. Last year a bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology recounted how bats once attacked a researcher at the WHCDC and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat).' It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out within 300 yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's blood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' Advertisement

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday the Washington government had 'deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them'.

And British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK shared 'concerns' that scientists would 'get full co-operation and they get the answers they need'.

Speaking to the BBC today, Prof Watson said: 'I think that there are all sorts of reasons to do with the way it did start in the outbreak in Wuhan and the various bits of information about the way in which these viruses live in different animal reservoirs, that suggest that China is a very, very possible source for the outbreak, but by no means necessarily the place where the leap from animals to humans took place.

'And I think we need to ensure that we are looking beyond the borders of China, as well as within China.'

Asked if the WHO team was given access to the raw data about the first 174 people who contracted coronavirus in China, Prof Watson said they saw a 'great deal' of information about the cases. However, he added that the team was only given access to a 'certain amount' of the raw data.

Prof Watson said: 'We didn't see all of that and we didn't see the original questionnaires that were used, but apart from the fact that, of course, they would have been in Chinese, one has to think about what one would have seen if one had gone to any other country in the world.'

He said the team's visit was not a 'one-off' and that the WHO sees it as 'the start of a process that's going to take really quite a while'.

China has faced claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could be the suspected source of the Covid-19 virus.

However, the WHO team concluded it was 'extremely unlikely' to have entered the human population as a result of a laboratory-related incident.

Prof Watson said the possibility that it may have escaped from a laboratory had not been 'ruled out'.

Foreign Secretary Mr Raab told the Andrew Marr Show that the UK Government would be 'pushing' for China to provide full access to its data.

He said: 'We'll be pushing for it to have full access, get all the data it needs to be able to answer the questions that I think most people want to hear answered around the outbreak, the causes.

'And that's important, not for geopolitical point-scoring or anything like that, but so we can learn the lessons and prevent it ever happening again.'

It comes after Peter Embarek, leader of the WHO team, said that 'further research' into the imported meat theory being pushed by Beijing is needed, along with studies looking at early cases of Covid reported outside of China.

At the same time, he dismissed theories that the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, saying the possibility is 'extremely unlikely' and does not need to be investigated further - despite US government officials calling it 'the most credible' theory just a few weeks ago.

It is hardly the first time that the WHO has come under fire for parroting information from Beijing, with Donald Trump made the same allegations last year before pulling US funding - a move President Biden has pledged to reverse.

Dr Tedros, the WHO chief, has also come in for heavy criticism for his praise of China - describing its 'commitment to transparency' as 'beyond words' during the early stages of the outbreak, despite strong doubts about data coming from Beijing and a past history of covering up disease outbreaks.

It was also revealed that Dr Tedros received support from Beijing while in the running to become WHO chief, and that China has often donated large sums of money to governments or organisations that he has been a part of.



During his press conference, Dr Embarek also backed assertions from Beijing that there is no evidence of transmission 'in Wuhan or elsewhere' in China before December 2019 - despite multiple studies suggesting the virus was circulating globally months earlier than that.

Outlining the findings of his team's month-long fact-finding mission, Dr Embarek said the team had failed to establish where the virus came from or how it first jumped into humans. Instead, he said the team had come up with four theories about its origins.

Peter Embarek, lead researcher for WHO in Wuhan, has put forward four theories about how the virus infected humans: Direct transfer from source animal into people, transfer via an intermediary animal, transfer via food, and transfer via a lab leak

Coronavirus DID start in China and 'exploded' at a Wuhan wet market after spreading from bats - despite Beijing's claim it could have arrived on frozen Australian beef, WHO scientist says The coronavirus pandemic started in China and 'exploded' at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, an Australian scientist investigating the origins of the pandemic claims. Professor Dominic Dwyer was one of 14 scientists who travelled to China over the past month in a World Health Organisation investigation into the virus that has killed 2.3 million people around the world. On Tuesday many were shocked to hear the leader of the WHO team, Peter Embarek, echo Communist Party's assertions that frozen food imports, such as Australian beef, could have led to the initial outbreak. However, Prof Dwyer, a microbiologist and infectious diseases expert, broke ranks with those claims, saying the source of the virus was most likely bats as previously suspected. 'The evidence for it starting elsewhere in the world is actually very limited. There is some evidence but it's not really very good,' he told Nine News. 'We know that other viruses that are closely related to [Covid-19] are present in bats. We know that other viruses like MERS and SARS back in 2003 also came from bats. 'Now these bats don't respect borders of course so they are present not just in China but in other parts on South East Asia and indeed elsewhere around the world.' From bats the contagion probably transferred to an intermediate animal such as a pangolin or a cat - which are sold at the traditional Chinese exotic animal 'wet markets' as food. Advertisement

He said the most likely explanation is that the virus passed from its original host animal into an intermediary animal that comes into close contact with humans, before making the leap into people.

Intermediary animals could include frozen or chilled animal products sold at markets in Wuhan, including those imported from overseas, he said, outlining his second theory.

The next most-likely theory is that the virus jumped directly from its original host into humans, Dr Embarek said, putting forward bats as a likely source.

But, he said, humans and bats do not come into close contact in Wuhan and swabs of bats and various other animal species in China - including wild animals, pets, and farm animals - has failed to find the original source.

Dr Embarek called for more research to be carried out into all three of these theories, and said teams should be looking outside as well as inside of China's borders.

The only theory he rejected out-of-hand was that the virus had leaked from a lab, saying such an event was 'extremely unlikely'.

Dr Liang Wannian, the head of China's Wuhan research team, further agreed - claiming that there is no evidence that Covid was present at any facility in China before appearing in humans.

If the virus was not present in a lab before the outbreak then it could not have escaped, he said.

Dr Wannian instead pushed the theory - which has become prevalent in China in recent weeks - that frozen food could have been the source, saying his research shows Covid can survive for a long time at low temperatures.

This means that the virus could have travelled long distances to reach Wuhan, he added, without specifically saying that it came from overseas.

He further revealed that Huanan Seafood Market - the market where the first cluster of Covid cases was detected - was not the only market in the city to be hit by the infection.

'While some of the early cases had close association with Huanan Seafood Market, others were associated with other markets,' he said, 'and other cases have no market association at all.

'It is likely that Huanan Market acted as focus for virus transmission, but the virus was also transmitted elsewhere at the same time. It is not possible on basis of current information to establish how the virus was introduced into Hunan market.'

In fact, he claimed, the earliest confirmed case of Covid in Wuhan - which occurred on December 8 - had no connection to any market within the city.

He added that samples taken from early cases at Huanan market showed slight variations in the virus, implying that it had been present in humans for an unknown length of time before causing those infections.

Dr Embarek agreed, saying that the market played a role in the early spread but that it has not be possible to establish how the virus got into the market or how it spread through it.

The WHO findings will be a PR coup for Beijing and leader Xi Jingping (pictured shaking hands with WHO leader Dr Tedros) with diplomats repeatedly jumping on any evidence that the pandemic which has blighted the world did not start in China

Multiple countries have uncovered evidence that the virus was circulating months earlier than originally thought. While Beijing has tried to insist this proves the virus originated elsewhere, most scientists still think China was the origin - raising the prospect that communist officials simply hid evidence of the early spread

Facebook Covid 'misinformation' crackdown sparks freedom of speech fears Facebook will crack down on 'misinformation' about Covid-19, including claims that coronavirus was man-made, the tech giant has announced, sparking freedom of speech fears. The news comes despite the outbreak's source still not being identified, and after WHO scientists researching the origins of Covid in China said it is 'extremely unlikely' the virus leaked from a lab . Facebook said that it has banned misinformation about all vaccines in a blog pos t on Monday, after years of controversy over the company's perceived inaction. Some of the claims that Facebook said it would be clamping down on includes unproven claims that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured and that vaccines cause autism or have other harmful effects. Claims that vaccines are not effective against preventing disease and that it is safer to get the disease than to get a vaccine have also been banned from the platform. Posts making such claims will be removed from the website, as well as Facebook-owned Instagram, the company said in the post that came with a list of 'misinformation ' it was banning from its platforms. But Jim Killock, Executive Director of the Open Rights Group, expressed the need for Facebook to be cautious, saying there is a fine line between misinformation and content expressing people's genuine concerns. 'Facebook need to take action, but will inevitably make mistakes. They were recently told by their Oversight Board to reinstate a post relating to the COVID outbreak that was wrongly removed,' Mr Killock told the MailOnline. 'There is always a fine line between material that seeks to deceive, and people expressing legitimate concerns about their health. Facebook need to reassure the public that their rights to criticise and examine Government health policy will not be swept away by careless moderators.' The ban has taken effect immediately, with Facebook saying it is paying particular attention to 'Pages, groups and accounts that violate these rules'. Facebook added that it will be expanding its efforts to stop the spread of what it deems misinformation in the coming weeks. 'There's still a long road ahead, and in 2021 we're focused on supporting health leaders and public officials in their work to vaccinate billions of people against COVID-19,' Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook's head of health, said in a statement.

Putting forward other explanations for how the virus crossed into humans, Dr Wannian suggested that cats could have acted as an intermediary animal after cases were reported in felines around the world.

He also pointed to Covid infections in mink as evidence of another host animal, rather than bats or pangolins - both animals which are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and cooking.

He added that tens of thousands of PCR tests have been conducted on animals around China since the initial outbreak, including on domestically farmed animals, wild animals, and pets. All of the tests were negative, he said.

Marion Koopmans, another WHO scientist who was part of the team in China, further suggested that a rabbit, a bamboo rat or a ferret badger could have acted as the intermediary because all are susceptible to coronaviruses and some were present at the Huanan market in Wuhan.

The WHO mission has been fraught from the start, first beset by delays and roadblocks thrown up by the Chinese government, and then later by claims that scientists were being fed little more than propaganda by Beijing authorities.

The experts spent one month in China, two weeks in quarantine, and then just two weeks on actual fieldwork.

Journalists were kept at arms' length during the visit while no official itinerary was published - and what little information did leak out was not promising.

For example, it was revealed that scientists spent just an hour at the Huanan Seafood Market but found time to visit a propaganda exhibition celebrating China's recovery from the pandemic.

They also appeared to spend several days inside their hotel receiving visits from various Chinese officials without going out into the city.

Deeper research was carried out at the Wuhan virology institute where they spent nearly four hours and said they met with Chinese scientists there including Shi Zhengli, one of China's leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan lab.

Former US president Donald Trump repeated a controversial theory that a lab leak may have been the source of the pandemic.

Scientists at the laboratory conduct research on some of the world's most dangerous diseases, including strains of bat coronaviruses similar to Covid-19.

Beijing is desperate to defang criticism of its handling of the chaotic early stages of the outbreak.

It has refocused attention at home - and abroad - on its handling of, and recovery from the outbreak.

Meanwhile an AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and prevented scientists from speaking to reporters.

The WHO team's mission is intended to be an initial step delving into the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in bats before being passed to humans through another species of wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat, which is considered an exotic delicacy by some in China.

Transmission through the trade in frozen products has emerged as a recent theory and has since become prevalent in China, and it appears WHO investigators also leaned towards the possibility.

Another member of the WHO team told The Associated Press late last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.

That expert, British-born zoologist Peter Daszak, said the team looked into issues including what the first cases were, the link with animals and what, if any, the role that imports of frozen food may have played - a theory that China has long put forward.

The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate after China only agreed to it amid massive international pressure at the World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation.

While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal.

Summing up his time in China, Dr Embarek concluded: 'It was fascinating to realise that these people are not holding very exciting clues.

'When we talked to one of first cases, you immediately think they must have some very special habits, hiking in mountains, keeping wild pets at home, instead you realise they are very much like us - spending days on the internet, same jobs, activities and sports as many of us do.

'Illustrating how complicated this work is, it is not possible to come up with all answers after a few weeks of study.

2021-02-13 13:32:05+00:00,4,"A mother has told of her shock after her breast milk turned neon green when she and her baby contracted Covid-19.

As Anna Cortez, 23, from Monterrey, Mexico, fought off the infection, she explained that her milk gradually got lighter and went back to its normal shade shortly after she tested negative for coronavirus.

She was informed by her paediatrician, who is also a lactation consultant, that the colour change may have been a result of her body's natural antibodies fighting off Covid to protect her daughter Mikayla, then four months.

Midwives have said breast milk can change colour slightly as a result of a diet rich in leafy greens or medication.

Anna, an English teacher who is studying psychology, was assured her milk was still safe despite its green hue, which she noticed after pumping it and putting it in the freezer.

A mother has told of her shock after shock after her breast milk turned neon green when she and her baby contracted Covid-19

As Anna Cortez, 23, from Monterrey, Mexico, fought off the infection, she explained that her milk gradually got lighter and went back to its normal shade shortly after she tested negative for coronavirus. Pictuted with daughter Mikayla

Speaking to the Mirror, Anna said she eats a lot of greens but hadn't changed her eating habits while battling Covid, and her milk is normally always white.

'I talked to my daughter’s paediatrician, who is also a lactation consultant, and she said it is common when the mum gets sick, or when the baby gets sick with a cold or stomach virus, that the mum's milk will change and adapt with antibodies,' she told the publication.

'The reason it was so noticeable in this case is because the virus is so strong.'

Anna, Mikayla and other members of her family contracted Covid last month. Anna lost her sense of taste and smell and experienced cold-like symptoms while her daughter developed a cough and a fever, but recovered after a few days.

Four days before she started to experience symptoms, Anna said her breast milk was still white.

Why does breast milk change colour? Clare Livingstone, an adviser from the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'Consumption of large amounts of certain foods, such as spinach, may cause the colour of breast milk to change. Also, some medication may have this effect. 'It's important women recognise the difference between a change in the colour of breast milk and discharge as a sign of infection. 'Mastitis is one of the more common sources of infection, and can include breast pain, swelling, warmth, redness, and discharge. 'Because women with mastitis may also have fever and chills, it can sometimes feel like flu, or even Covid-19. If you are concerned about changes or if something doesn’t feel right please contact your midwife or GP.' Advertisement

The next time she pumped, by which point she felt dehydrated and her supply was reduced, she was infected.

She didn't notice the colour change immediately, but when she took a sachet out of the freezer she spotted it looked different.

'It had almost a neon sheen to it,' she told the Mirror. 'I was like, ""What the heck is this?"" I didn't know what was going on.

'I kept pumping and kept watching while I was sick. Throughout the whole time I was positive (with coronavirus), the milk was green.'

Anna shared photos of the milk on Facebook and said other mothers got in touch to say they'd experienced the same thing when they were unwell.

The images were then shared by Milky Mama, a company in California that makes biscuits, brownies and other products that help milk production, and subsequently went viral.

One mother commented on the post: 'I was sick and tested negative for Covid but had all the symptoms. Now I am looking at this pic and wondering if that is why I thought my breast milk then had a neon green glow.'

'This had me go look through mine and I see the greenish colour too,' wrote another.

And one remarked: 'Freaking awesome! Our bodies are amazing! We were positive and nursed through! Freaking incredible!'

Anna added that she was advised to continue breastfeeding even after testing positive for Covid because it's the best thing for her daughter and if she became ill, the breast milk would help her fight it.

Current evidence suggests that it is safe to breastfeed and continue to offer breastmilk if you have COVID-19.

Experts have said the long-term well established benefits of breastfeeding, including the protection it provides against many illnesses, are highly likely to outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk.

Dr Natalie Shenker, a breast milk researcher at Imperial College London and co-founder of the Human Milk Foundation, told the Mirror: 'We do know that women who are infected with Covid do generate antibodies against Covid and those antibodies go into the milk in over 90 per cent of women.'

She added that the actual virus doesn't go into the milk.

A study of 15 lactating mothers who had recovered from Covid-19 last year, reported in iScience, found antibodies specifically bound to Covid-19 in their breast milk.

If you have confirmed COVID-19 or have symptoms, the advice is to take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to your baby, including washing your hands before touching your baby, sterilising any breast pumps or bottles and washing your hands after changing their nappy. You might also want to consider wearing a face covering or fluid-resistant face mask while feeding or caring for the baby.",MailOnline,"['symptoms', 'neon', 'green', 'turned', 'claims', 'antibodies', 'breast', 'change', 'anna', 'milk', 'covid', 'virus', 'covid19', 'colour', 'mother', 'baby', 'told']",0
2021-02-13 13:00:38+00:00,8,"France said today that patients who have already had Covid-19 should only get one dose of a vaccine, making it the first country to adopt such a strategy and potentially freeing up millions of doses amid an EU-wide struggle for jab supplies.

Health officials said a single dose would be enough to 'remind' the body how to fight off the virus, because an earlier infection would already have generated an immune response similar to a first shot of the vaccine.

With 3.4million people infected in France in the last year, the new advice will reduce the demands on France's spluttering jab roll-out as it struggles against bungled EU purchasing, rigid bureaucracy and high levels of vaccine scepticism.

It also comes after France lashed out at Britain for its own deviation from the two-dose strategy - a move which has helped the UK vaccinate six times more people than France has done so far.

France has handed out 3.5 doses per 100 people so far, below the EU-wide figure of 4.2 and a long way behind the UK figure of 20.0

The three vaccines approved in the EU - Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca - are all administered in two doses because trials showed them to be effective that way.

But preliminary scientific findings have shown that single shot can produce a 'very robust response' in people who have already fought off the infection once.

A study of 59 health workers who had recovered from Covid-19 found they had higher antibody levels after just one jab than most people have after two doses.

A separate study found that 41 Covid-19 survivors had antibody levels 10 to 20 times higher after one dose than people who had not been infected before.

'The data presented in these two papers are not surprising but are very reassuring,' said immunologist Professor Eleanor Riley of the University of Edinburgh earlier this month.

'Both papers show that a previous infection with Covid-19 primes the immune system to make a very robust response to a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine.'

Dr Peter English, a former chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said the papers 'describe exactly what the science would predict'.

'It would be entirely rational to focus second, booster doses of vaccine on people who have not had natural priming,' he said.

France's public health authority has now adopted that approach, saying those already infected should not get a jab for at least three months after recovering and potentially as long as six months.

'A single vaccine dose will also play the role of reminding' people's immune system how to fight Covid-19, the health authority said.

'At the moment no country has clearly positioned itself in terms of a sole vaccination dose for people who have already contracted Covid-19,' it added.

French president Emmanuel Macron, pictured, has been criticised for questioning the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, as the country struggles to speed up its jab roll-out

A vaccine still in development by Johnson & Johnson works with a single dose, but it is yet to receive emergency use authorisation from EU and US regulators.

France's vaccine programme is still in its infancy six weeks after the EU roll-out began, with only two million people getting any kind of jab so far compared to 13.5million in similarly-sized Britain.

And despite the UK virtually abandoning second doses for the time being, Britain has handed out 524,000 of them in total compared to 442,000 in France.

The UK strategy was savaged last week by France's European affairs minister Clement Beaune, who accused Britain of taking 'enormous risks'.

'I do not think that our citizens would accept us taking all these risks contrary to the opinion of our scientists,' he told French radio.

In fact, the UK's four chief medical officers have backed the one-dose strategy and said that a single shot offers 'considerable protection' at least in the short term.

France is also among the countries to have restricted the AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s because of the small sample size among older people in clinical trials.

A woman is vaccinated in Paris on Thursday, with France lagging behind Britain and some of its EU neighbours in the vaccine race

Emmanuel Macron was criticised for questioning the effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab despite it being approved for all groups by EU regulators.

A survey published earlier this month by YouGov and Imperial College London found 44 per cent of French people saying they would not take a vaccine, the highest figure of any country in the study.

By contrast, people in Britain were the most willing to have a vaccine with 78 per cent saying they would, followed by 67 per cent in Denmark.

France has also suffered the humiliation of seeing its own home-grown vaccine efforts fail to get off the ground in the country of vaccine pioneer Louis Pasteur.

The Pasteur Institute was working on a potential vaccine with drugmaker Merck, but it was shelved last month after disappointing results in trials.

The new strategy for recovered patients could save millions of doses in a country where 3,406,685 people have been infected so far.

Although 80,803 of those have died, there are likely to be many more who have already developed antibodies but were never tested because of limited supplies.",MailOnline,"['dose', 'strategy', 'patients', 'eu', 'plans', 'doses', 'france', 'vaccine', 'recovered', 'covid', 'country', 'covid19', 'single', 'jab']",0

'It seems more likely that it would stay. It seems very well adapted to humans,' she said.

'It wouldn't be the first virus that is with us forever, so it's not an unusual feature for a virus.'

While vaccines dramatically reduce the risk of contracting the illness caused by Covid-19, scientists have not yet established with certainty whether vaccines also reduce transmission of the virus.

There is also particular concern that the vaccines may not be as effective against some variants of Covid-19, especially the South African and Brazilian ones.

'The question is what it then means in terms of the changes of the virus for the vaccine effectiveness,' Ammon said, citing the seasonal flu as an example where vaccines are adapted annually.

2021-02-12 22:47:02+00:00,14,"France said today that patients who have already had Covid-19 should only get one dose of a vaccine, making it the first country to adopt such a strategy and potentially freeing up millions of doses amid an EU-wide struggle for jab supplies.

Health officials said a single dose would be enough to 'remind' the body how to fight off the virus, because an earlier infection would already have generated an immune response similar to a first shot of the vaccine.

With 3.4million people infected in France in the last year, the new advice will reduce the demands on France's spluttering jab roll-out as it struggles against bungled EU purchasing, rigid bureaucracy and high levels of vaccine scepticism.

It also comes after France lashed out at Britain for its own deviation from the two-dose strategy - a move which has helped the UK vaccinate six times more people than France has done so far.

France has handed out 3.5 doses per 100 people so far, below the EU-wide figure of 4.2 and a long way behind the UK figure of 20.0

The three vaccines approved in the EU - Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca - are all administered in two doses because trials showed them to be effective that way.

But preliminary scientific findings have shown that single shot can produce a 'very robust response' in people who have already fought off the infection once.

A study of 59 health workers who had recovered from Covid-19 found they had higher antibody levels after just one jab than most people have after two doses.

A separate study found that 41 Covid-19 survivors had antibody levels 10 to 20 times higher after one dose than people who had not been infected before.

'The data presented in these two papers are not surprising but are very reassuring,' said immunologist Professor Eleanor Riley of the University of Edinburgh earlier this month.

'Both papers show that a previous infection with Covid-19 primes the immune system to make a very robust response to a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine.'

Dr Peter English, a former chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said the papers 'describe exactly what the science would predict'.

'It would be entirely rational to focus second, booster doses of vaccine on people who have not had natural priming,' he said.

France's public health authority has now adopted that approach, saying those already infected should not get a jab for at least three months after recovering and potentially as long as six months.

'A single vaccine dose will also play the role of reminding' people's immune system how to fight Covid-19, the health authority said.

'At the moment no country has clearly positioned itself in terms of a sole vaccination dose for people who have already contracted Covid-19,' it added.

French president Emmanuel Macron, pictured, has been criticised for questioning the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, as the country struggles to speed up its jab roll-out

A vaccine still in development by Johnson & Johnson works with a single dose, but it is yet to receive emergency use authorisation from EU and US regulators.

France's vaccine programme is still in its infancy six weeks after the EU roll-out began, with only two million people getting any kind of jab so far compared to 13.5million in similarly-sized Britain.

And despite the UK virtually abandoning second doses for the time being, Britain has handed out 524,000 of them in total compared to 442,000 in France.

The UK strategy was savaged last week by France's European affairs minister Clement Beaune, who accused Britain of taking 'enormous risks'.

'I do not think that our citizens would accept us taking all these risks contrary to the opinion of our scientists,' he told French radio.

In fact, the UK's four chief medical officers have backed the one-dose strategy and said that a single shot offers 'considerable protection' at least in the short term.

France is also among the countries to have restricted the AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s because of the small sample size among older people in clinical trials.

Emmanuel Macron was criticised for questioning the effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab despite it being approved for all groups by EU regulators.

A survey published earlier this month by YouGov and Imperial College London found 44 per cent of French people saying they would not take a vaccine, the highest figure of any country in the study.

By contrast, people in Britain were the most willing to have a vaccine with 78 per cent saying they would, followed by 67 per cent in Denmark.

France has also suffered the humiliation of seeing its own home-grown vaccine efforts fail to get off the ground in the country of vaccine pioneer Louis Pasteur.

The Pasteur Institute was working on a potential vaccine with drugmaker Merck, but it was shelved last month after disappointing results in trials.

The new strategy for recovered patients could save millions of doses in a country where 3,406,685 people have been infected so far.

Although 80,803 of those have died, there are likely to be many more who have already developed antibodies but were never tested because of limited supplies.",MailOnline,"['dose', 'strategy', 'patients', 'eu', 'plans', 'doses', 'france', 'vaccine', 'recovered', 'covid', 'country', 'covid19', 'single', 'jab']",0

As Anna Cortez, 23, from Monterrey, Mexico, fought off the infection, she explained that her milk gradually got lighter and went back to its normal shade shortly after she tested negative for coronavirus.

She was informed by her paediatrician, who is also a lactation consultant, that the colour change may have been a result of her body's natural antibodies fighting off Covid to protect her daughter Mikayla, then four months.

Midwives have said breast milk can change colour slightly as a result of a diet rich in leafy greens or medication.

Anna, an English teacher who is studying psychology, was assured her milk was still safe despite its green hue, which she noticed after pumping it and putting it in the freezer.

Speaking to the Mirror, Anna said she eats a lot of greens but hadn't changed her eating habits while battling Covid, and her milk is normally always white.

'I talked to my daughter’s paediatrician, who is also a lactation consultant, and she said it is common when the mum gets sick, or when the baby gets sick with a cold or stomach virus, that the mum's milk will change and adapt with antibodies,' she told the publication.

'The reason it was so noticeable in this case is because the virus is so strong.'

Anna, Mikayla and other members of her family contracted Covid last month. Anna lost her sense of taste and smell and experienced cold-like symptoms while her daughter developed a cough and a fever, but recovered after a few days.

Four days before she started to experience symptoms, Anna said her breast milk was still white.

Why does breast milk change colour? Clare Livingstone, an adviser from the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'Consumption of large amounts of certain foods, such as spinach, may cause the colour of breast milk to change. Also, some medication may have this effect. 'It's important women recognise the difference between a change in the colour of breast milk and discharge as a sign of infection. 'Mastitis is one of the more common sources of infection, and can include breast pain, swelling, warmth, redness, and discharge. 'Because women with mastitis may also have fever and chills, it can sometimes feel like flu, or even Covid-19. If you are concerned about changes or if something doesn’t feel right please contact your midwife or GP.' Advertisement

The next time she pumped, by which point she felt dehydrated and her supply was reduced, she was infected.

She didn't notice the colour change immediately, but when she took a sachet out of the freezer she spotted it looked different.

'It had almost a neon sheen to it,' she told the Mirror. 'I was like, ""What the heck is this?"" I didn't know what was going on.

'I kept pumping and kept watching while I was sick. Throughout the whole time I was positive (with coronavirus), the milk was green.'

Anna shared photos of the milk on Facebook and said other mothers got in touch to say they'd experienced the same thing when they were unwell.

The images were then shared by Milky Mama, a company in California that makes biscuits, brownies and other products that help milk production, and subsequently went viral.

One mother commented on the post: 'I was sick and tested negative for Covid but had all the symptoms. Now I am looking at this pic and wondering if that is why I thought my breast milk then had a neon green glow.'

'This had me go look through mine and I see the greenish colour too,' wrote another.

And one remarked: 'Freaking awesome! Our bodies are amazing! We were positive and nursed through! Freaking incredible!'

Anna added that she was advised to continue breastfeeding even after testing positive for Covid because it's the best thing for her daughter and if she became ill, the breast milk would help her fight it.

Current evidence suggests that it is safe to breastfeed and continue to offer breastmilk if you have COVID-19.

Experts have said the long-term well established benefits of breastfeeding, including the protection it provides against many illnesses, are highly likely to outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk.

Dr Natalie Shenker, a breast milk researcher at Imperial College London and co-founder of the Human Milk Foundation, told the Mirror: 'We do know that women who are infected with Covid do generate antibodies against Covid and those antibodies go into the milk in over 90 per cent of women.'

She added that the actual virus doesn't go into the milk.

A study of 15 lactating mothers who had recovered from Covid-19 last year, reported in iScience, found antibodies specifically bound to Covid-19 in their breast milk.

If you have confirmed COVID-19 or have symptoms, the advice is to take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to your baby, including washing your hands before touching your baby, sterilising any breast pumps or bottles and washing your hands after changing their nappy.

Health officials said a single dose would be enough to 'remind' the body how to fight off the virus, because an earlier infection would already have generated an immune response similar to a first shot of the vaccine.

With 3.4million people infected in France in the last year, the new advice will reduce the demands on France's spluttering jab roll-out as it struggles against bungled EU purchasing, rigid bureaucracy and high levels of vaccine scepticism.

It also comes after France lashed out at Britain for its own deviation from the two-dose strategy - a move which has helped the UK vaccinate six times more people than France has done so far.

France has handed out 3.5 doses per 100 people so far, below the EU-wide figure of 4.2 and a long way behind the UK figure of 20.0

The three vaccines approved in the EU - Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca - are all administered in two doses because trials showed them to be effective that way.

But preliminary scientific findings have shown that single shot can produce a 'very robust response' in people who have already fought off the infection once.

A study of 59 health workers who had recovered from Covid-19 found they had higher antibody levels after just one jab than most people have after two doses.

A separate study found that 41 Covid-19 survivors had antibody levels 10 to 20 times higher after one dose than people who had not been infected before.

'The data presented in these two papers are not surprising but are very reassuring,' said immunologist Professor Eleanor Riley of the University of Edinburgh earlier this month.

'Both papers show that a previous infection with Covid-19 primes the immune system to make a very robust response to a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine.'

Dr Peter English, a former chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said the papers 'describe exactly what the science would predict'.

'It would be entirely rational to focus second, booster doses of vaccine on people who have not had natural priming,' he said.

France's public health authority has now adopted that approach, saying those already infected should not get a jab for at least three months after recovering and potentially as long as six months.

'A single vaccine dose will also play the role of reminding' people's immune system how to fight Covid-19, the health authority said.

'At the moment no country has clearly positioned itself in terms of a sole vaccination dose for people who have already contracted Covid-19,' it added.

French president Emmanuel Macron, pictured, has been criticised for questioning the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, as the country struggles to speed up its jab roll-out

A vaccine still in development by Johnson & Johnson works with a single dose, but it is yet to receive emergency use authorisation from EU and US regulators.

France's vaccine programme is still in its infancy six weeks after the EU roll-out began, with only two million people getting any kind of jab so far compared to 13.5million in similarly-sized Britain.

And despite the UK virtually abandoning second doses for the time being, Britain has handed out 524,000 of them in total compared to 442,000 in France.

The UK strategy was savaged last week by France's European affairs minister Clement Beaune, who accused Britain of taking 'enormous risks'.

'I do not think that our citizens would accept us taking all these risks contrary to the opinion of our scientists,' he told French radio.

In fact, the UK's four chief medical officers have backed the one-dose strategy and said that a single shot offers 'considerable protection' at least in the short term.

France is also among the countries to have restricted the AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s because of the small sample size among older people in clinical trials.

Emmanuel Macron was criticised for questioning the effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab despite it being approved for all groups by EU regulators.

A survey published earlier this month by YouGov and Imperial College London found 44 per cent of French people saying they would not take a vaccine, the highest figure of any country in the study.

By contrast, people in Britain were the most willing to have a vaccine with 78 per cent saying they would, followed by 67 per cent in Denmark.

France has also suffered the humiliation of seeing its own home-grown vaccine efforts fail to get off the ground in the country of vaccine pioneer Louis Pasteur.

The Pasteur Institute was working on a potential vaccine with drugmaker Merck, but it was shelved last month after disappointing results in trials.

The new strategy for recovered patients could save millions of doses in a country where 3,406,685 people have been infected so far.

2021-02-11 11:40:04+00:00,8,"It has long been known that superspreaders are responsible for the vast majority of coronavirus infections and now a study has found heavy breathers are likely culprits.

Data shows more than 80 per cent of all exhaled aerosol particles are produced by less than one in five people, meeting the technical definition for superspreaders.

These tiny particles can carry viruses including SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and are so small they float around in a room and can linger for several minutes.

Older people, those with a large BMI, and infected cases are more likely to be heavy breathers spewing out huge amounts of infectious particles, the research shows.

Older people and those with a large BMI are more likely to be heavy breathers spewing out huge amounts of infectious particles, the research shows

The first part of the study measured the number of particles expressed per individual per litre and compared it to a combination of their age and BMI.

It showed a strong link between age and BMI with increased production of exhaled aerosols, indicating fatter and older people are the worst offenders for being heavy breather superspreaders.

The study reveals a 'classical superspreading 20:80' distribution, the study authors note.

The so-called 80:20 rule means that for something to be scientifically considered as a superspreader event, at least 80 per cent of infections must be caused by no more than 20 per cent of people.

'The phenomenon of superspreading of COVID-19 may be not only a matter of air currents and proximity of infected and naive hosts but also of phenotype,' the scientists write in their paper published in PNAS.

Exhaled breath of 194 health people was studied by scientists at Harvard, MIT and Tulane University.

They also deliberately gave Covid to eight monkeys to see if infection with the coronavirus affected the amount of produced aerosols.

Writing in their study, the authors say the Covid-19 particles produced by infected primates 'rises to a crescendo' a week after infection before falling to normal after two weeks in a similar way to as seen in humans.

Data shows more than 80 per cent of all exhaled aerosol particles are produced by less than one in five people. These tiny particles can carry viruses including SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and are so small they float around in a room and can linger for several minutes (stock)

The increase in exhaled aerosols occurred even among asymptomatic cases of Covid-19, says Dr Chad Roy, corresponding author of the study from Tulane.

'It seems likely that viral and bacterial infections of the airway can weaken airway mucus, which promotes the movement of infectious particles into this environment,' he said.

Lead author Dr David Edwards, from Harvard, believes how many respiratory droplets a person produces changes depending on their body and health.

'While our results show that the young and healthy tend to generate far fewer droplets than the older and less healthy, they also show that any of us, when infected by COVID-19, may be at risk of producing a large number of respiratory droplets,' he said.

Previous research has revealed that joggers may also be superspreaders of the virus.

A video, established by Professor Bert Blocken and Fabio Malizia (KU Leuven & Technology University Eiondhoven (TU/e) and powered by simulation technology company Ansys, showed that droplets can spread more than six feet behind you while you are walking, running or cycling.

'If we see a whale or dolphin blow through their blowhole, we can see the water and jump out of way if we have to,' Marc Horner, the principal engineer for healthcare at Ansys, told DailyMail.com

'But if someone sneezes or coughs, it happens so quickly and the droplets are so small, [the simulation gets] that mental image in your mind of how far away you need to stand so gravity has time to pull the droplets down.'",MailOnline,"['heavy', 'likely', 'study', 'infected', 'breathers', 'exhaled', 'particles', 'covid19', 'cent', 'droplets', 'produced', 'superspreaders']",0
2021-02-11 05:15:52+00:00,23,"Can animals catch Covid-19?

The chance of your dog catching Covid-19 strain is very slim, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Professor James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, said: 'Despite millions of people having had Covid-19, the numbers of pets found to be ill or infected is still tiny.

'Put simply, our pet dogs and cats can catch Covid-19 from us, when they are living with us, but only do on very rare occasions.'

Scientists say pets don't appear to get very sick with Covid-19, and various pet organisations and charities say there is no need to be worried.

The first dog in the world to catch coronavirus died after it was declared disease-free and returned home to its owner in Hong Kong.

The owner of the 17-year-old Pomeranian, whose also had Covid-19, did not allow the dog to be autopsied, so the exact cause of death remains unknown.

How do animals get infected?

Animals are likely to catch the virus the same way a human would — when respiratory droplets enter the pets' nose or mouth.

Professor Wood said: 'Cats may become infected by the high doses of virus transmitted by their infected owners in some settings.

'The relative size of a cat versus a human means that there is far less exhaled breath from one cat in a house, compared to the exhaled breath volumes from a human patient.

'Further, the grooming behaviour of cats means that they are more likely to catch infection from an owner than vice versa.'

When pets have been reported to have the virus, they have signs that indicate a respiratory illness.

Downing Street said the cat in England with the virus had symptoms of a respiratory infection with a nasal discharge and some shortness of breath.

Scientists have shown that cats, ferrets and hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. But ducks, chickens and pigs don't appear to be.

Professor William Weir, of the University of Glasgow's School of Veterinary Medicine, said 'the significance of SARS-CoV-2 as a feline or canine pathogen is unknown'.

He added that there have been no reports of cats passing the virus to dogs or vice versa.

Can humans catch Covid-19 from animals?

There is no evidence that a human could catch the coronavirus from an animal in the same way as it would from another human.

Covid-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.

Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said pets produce 'very low levels of the virus' compared to humans.

Professor James Wood, head of department of veterinary medicine, University of Cambridge, added that pets would exhale far less breath — which may have virus droplets inside — than humans.

In any case where a pet has tested positive for the virus, the owner reportedly had it first.

The WHO says: 'While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit Covid-19.'

Professor Weir said: 'At present, there is no evidence that cats, dogs or other domestic animals play any role in the epidemiology of human infections with SARS-CoV-2.'

An official report by the UK's top vet said household pets may carry the virus on their fur, which risks spreading the disease from person to person.

It said: 'Close contact such as cuddling, grooming, feeding and allowing animals to share food could all allow the transfer of virus.'

The document, prepared by the UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, was considered on April 30 at a meeting of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).

The report warned that the virus could survive on pet fur, meaning 'there is a plausible pathway that the animal may act as a fomite [infectious object] for at least a few hours and transfer virus to others in the household.'

It added that pet owners who have symptoms to prevent their dog or cat from coming into contact with 'susceptible humans'.

How many pets have had the infection?

A very small number of pets have been reported to have the coronavirus in other countries in Europe, North America and Asia.

The first dog in the world to catch coronavirus in Hong Kong, a 17-year-old Pomeranian, died on March 16.

It was declared disease-free and returned home to its owner, a 60-year-old woman who was hospitalised with Covid-19 the month prior, after being quarantined at a government facility.

The dog was never autopsied, and so the exact cause of death was not determined.

What precautions should I take when dealing with animals?

If you are sick with Covid-19, it is recommended you restrict contact with your dog and see if other people can look after them.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says: 'It is still recommended that people sick with Covid-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.'

Charles, 72, and Camilla, 73, are likely to have received it from a royal doctor at home. The couple have been isolating at Highgrove House in Gloucestershire, although the Duchess is currently at her Wiltshire home, Ray Mill House.

It is likely, although not confirmed, that Charles and Camilla would have had the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as did the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. A friend said Camilla seemed ‘very happy’.

Both Prince Charles and his son Prince William were struck down with Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic last year.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations. Pictured, the couple at the Gloucestershire Vaccination Centre in December

Charles has previously confirmed his intention to get vaccinated, but stressed that neither he – nor his wife – would expectany preferential treatment and would wait for their call as part of the over-70s group.

In December, Charles told staff administering the injection that he was ‘way down the list’ to receive it.

He made the admission as he visited the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in Gloucester to meet frontline health workers.

The royal told staff: ‘I think I’ll have to wait for the AstraZeneca one before it gets to my turn. I’m some way down the list and will have to wait.’

It is not known where they were administered or which version of the vaccine Prince Charles, 72, and Camilla, 73, received. Pictured, Prince Charles on an engagement in December

Last month it was revealed that the Queen, 94, and 99-year-old Prince Philip were among the first wave to receive their Covid-19 jabs.

A royal source said the vaccinations were administered by a household doctor at Windsor Castle.

Buckingham Palace had initially insisted the Queen would not let it be known if and when she had it as it was a ‘private medical matter’.

US researchers found a link between a loss of smell, known as anosmia, and decreased sexual motivation and emotional satisfaction in older US adults.

The experts say the sense of smell plays 'a uniquely strong role' in sexual motivation – and that both are 'intimately linked'.

Researchers only looked at adults aged 65 and older, meaning the link could only get stronger as we grow older and may be less pronounced in young adults.

Despite this, researchers say potentially treatable causes of sensory loss like should be addressed by clinicians to 'improve quality of life' – in other words, their sex life.

Loss of smell from Covid-19 does not appear to be permanent, scientists say, but can be an early symptom of the disease. Researchers say the loss of smell as a whole is linked to decreased sexual motivation

What is anosmia? Anosmia is the medical name for a condition in which someone suffers a complete or partial loss of their sense of smell. The most common single cause of the condition – temporary or permanent – is illnesses which affect the nose or sinuses, such as polyps which grow in the airways, fractured bones or cartilage, hay fever or tumours. It is different to hyposmia, which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells. Around 3.5 million people in the UK are affected by the condition, along with nearly 10 million in the US. It is surprisingly common and affects between three and five per cent of people. Head injuries and nervous system diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's may also contribute to the condition by damaging nerves in the nose which are responsible for detecting smells.

As we grow older, our sensory functions steadily decline, with various impacts for older adults.

Previous research has already suggested that smell disorder patients complain about impairments in their sexual life.

To learn more, researchers investigated the effect of a loss of the olfactory function, or sense of smell, has on older people's sexual desire and satisfaction.

The team, which also included an expert from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, worked with a sample of 2,084 older adults in the US, all aged 65 or older.

The adults, described as a 'nationally representative sample', were recruited from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal, population-based study of health and social factors.

The experts measured their olfactory sensitivity with smelling sticks and their frequency of sexual thoughts and sexual activity through a questionnaire, as well as satisfaction with their most recent sexual relationship.

'Decreased olfactory function in older US adults was associated with decreased sexual motivation and less emotional satisfaction with sex, but not decreased frequency of sexual activity or physical pleasure,' the researchers say.

However, a decrease in sensitivity of smell did not indicate a decreased frequency of sexual activity or a decrease in physical pleasure.

Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, education, cognition, comorbidities and depression – but the team could not determine causality, meaning it's not known if loss of smell causes decreased sex drive or vice versa.

Researchers only looked at adults aged 65 and older - meaning the link between loss of smell and low sex drive could only get stronger as we grow older and may be less pronounced in young adults

'Our research shows a decline in olfactory function may affect sexual pleasure in older adults,' said study author Jesse K. Siegel at the University of Chicago.

'Therefore, treatable causes of sensory loss should be addressed by clinicians to improve sexual health.'

The experts say this might be due to 'evolutionarily-conserved' neurological links between olfaction and sexuality.

'Olfaction has a strong, evolutionary-conserved connection to the limbic system, which plays a critical role in processing emotions and sexual motivation,' Siegel and her team say in their paper, published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine.

'Neurons in the olfactory bulb also project directly to the hypothalamus, another key mediator of sexual motivation.'

Study author Dr Jayant Pinto, also at the University of Chicago, told MailOnline that olfactory system is connected to centres in the brain that allow the experience of pleasure.

'These connections are ancient in that lower organisms need to detect chemicals in the environment [such as] nutrients to feed, toxins to avoid,' he said.

'As sexuality is essential for reproduction, this too depends on sensory input.

'Thus, the associations we find may be signs that these two old parts of our nervous system physiology are connected.

'The benefit would be more efficient mating and more progeny, in an evolutionary sense.'

The study was performed pre-Covid, meaning it's also not known how loss of smell in people with Covid specifically is linked to sexual desire.

World Health Organisation scientists have given credibility to Beijing's claim that the Covid-19 pandemic may have started outside China and been brought into Wuhan via frozen food imports.

A team of 14 scientists investigating the origin of the pandemic wrapped up their month-long fact-finding mission by echoing Communist Party's assertions that 'cold-chain products' such as Australian beef, could have led to the initial outbreak.

Peter Embarek, leader of the WHO team, said further studies should be carried out into whether the virus was imported into the country - possibly on frozen meats sold at the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan where the first cluster of cases was detected in December 2019.

WHO investigators also ruled out the possibility the virus leaked from a lab, calling it 'extremely unlikely' and declaring no further study should be undertaken into the theory.

The heavily-controlled visit is a major PR coup for the authoritarian state, which has repeatedly tried to pin the blame on other countries.

It will also give ammunition to WHO's critics, who feared the investigation would be used to give legitimacy to a Chinese white-washing exercise - with possibly embarrassing or incriminating evidence hidden from investigators.

In the aftermath of the initial outbreak Beijing officials tried desperately to cover-up the growing number of deaths in Hubei Province by silencing anyone who tried to warn about the respiratory disease.

Since then China has attempted to shift the narrative though it's 'Wolf Warrior' diplomats and state-owned media mouthpieces.

'As the mounting sporadic outbreaks in China were found to be related to imported cold-chain products, with other parts of the world, including Europe and the American continent, reportedly discovering signs of the coronavirus earlier than Wuhan,'an article in The Global Times asked in December last year.

'It begs a new hypothesis – did the early outbreak in Wuhan originate from imported frozen food?'

Chinese officials also pointed the finger at a number of other countries including Bangladesh, the US, Greece, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia, and Serbia.

Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: 'The tracing of the virus origin will most likely involve multiple countries and localities.'

Australia's diplomatic relationship with China soured during the pandemic after Prime Minister Scott Morison called for the investigation into the origins of coronavirus, and the subsequent cover-ups which followed.

China retaliated by relentlessly targeting Australia in an increasingly aggressive and belligerent campaign of economic sanctions and blockades Beijing.

China imposed a litany of unofficial bans and arbitrary tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Australia exports after Canberra called for the inquiry.

Six of Australia's top beef distributors were hit with blanket bans along with cotton, timbre, seafood and coal producers.

The wine industry Down Under was hit with a crippling 212 per cent tariff - contravening the two nation's 2015 Free Trade agreement - while barely growers also had an 80 per cent barrier slapped on exports.

Australia is now preparing to take legal action against China at a World Trade Organisation tribunal, but the process to have the tariffs removed could take several years.

The WHO has previously come under fire from world leaders including ex-US President Trump for being 'China-centric' and uncritically parroting Beijing propaganda - playing down the severity of the disease until it was too late to stop it becoming a crippling pandemic.

Dr Tedros, the WHO chief, has also come in for heavy criticism for his praise of China - describing its 'commitment to transparency' as 'beyond words' during the early stages of the outbreak, despite strong doubts about data coming from Beijing and a past history of covering up potential pandemics.

It was also revealed that Dr Tedros received support from Beijing while in the running to become WHO chief, and that China has often donated large sums of money to governments or organisations that he has been a part of.

During his press conference, Dr Embarek also backed assertions from Beijing that there is no evidence of transmission 'in Wuhan or elsewhere' in China before December 2019 - despite multiple studies suggesting the virus was circulating globally months earlier than that.

Outlining the findings of his team's month-long study trip, Dr Embarek said the team had failed to establish where the virus came from or how it first jumped into humans. Instead, he said the team had come up with four theories about its origins.

Peter Embarek, lead researcher for WHO in Wuhan, has put forward four theories about how the virus infected humans: Direct transfer from source animal into people, transfer via an intermediary animal, transfer via food, and transfer via a lab leak (pictured, a chart showing the four routes)

Dr Embarek said his team has ruled out the possibility that the virus leaked from a lab such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology (pictured), saying such a leak is 'extremely unlikely' and should not be investigated further

China's official timeline vs new evidence Official timeline Dec 8, 2019 - Earliest date that China has acknowledged an infection Dec 31 - China first reported 'pneumonia of unknown cause' to the World Health Organisation Jan 1, 2020 - Wuhan seafood market closed for disinfection Jan 11 - China reported its first death Jan 23 - Wuhan locked down Jan 31 - WHO declared 'outbreak of international concern' as China admitted having thousands of cases Feb 23 - Italy reports cluster of cases in first major outbreak in the West New evidence Sep 2019- Blood samples are taken in a lung cancer screening trial in Italy which later test positive for coronavirus Oct-Dec - Rise in 'flu and pneumonia' cases in northern Italy which could be linked to coronavirus Nov - Sewage samples taken in Florianópolis, Brazil, suggest virus was present Nov 10 - Milanese woman has a skin biopsy, producing a sample which later shows signs of the virus Nov 17 - Leaked documents suggest case detected in China on this date Dec 1 - Chinese researchers report an infection on this date in a peer-reviewed study, but it has not been acknowledged by Beijing Dec 18 - Sewage samples taken in Milan and Turin suggest virus was circulating in the cities Jan 2020 - Sewage samples from Barcelona suggest virus was in the city Advertisement

He said the most likely explanation is that the virus passed from its original host animal into an intermediary animal that comes into close contact with humans, before making the leap into people.

Intermediary animals could include frozen or chilled animal products sold at markets in Wuhan, including those imported from overseas, he said, outlining his second theory.

The next most-likely theory is that the virus jumped directly from its original host into humans, Dr Embarek said, putting forward bats as a likely source.

But, he said, humans and bats do not come into close contact in Wuhan and swabs of bats and various other animal species in China - including wild animals, pets, and farm animals - has failed to find the original source.

Dr Embarek called for more research to be carried out into all three of these theories, and said teams should be looking outside as well as inside of China's borders.

The only theory he rejected out-of-hand was that the virus had leaked from a lab, saying such an event was 'extremely unlikely'.

Dr Liang Wannian, the head of China's Wuhan research team, further agreed - claiming that there is no evidence that Covid was present at any facility in China before appearing in humans.

If the virus was not present in a lab before the outbreak then it could not have escaped, he said.

Dr Wannian instead pushed the theory - which has become prevalent in China in recent weeks - that frozen food could have been the source, saying his research shows Covid can survive for a long time at low temperatures.

This means that the virus could have travelled long distances to reach Wuhan, he added, without specifically saying that it came from overseas.

He further revealed that Huanan Seafood Market - the market where the first cluster of Covid cases was detected - was not the only market in the city to be hit by the infection.

'While some of the early cases had close association with Huanan Seafood Market, others were associated with other markets,' he said, 'and other cases have no market association at all.

'It is likely that Huanan Market acted as focus for virus transmission, but the virus was also transmitted elsewhere at the same time. It is not possible on basis of current information to establish how the virus was introduced into Hunan market.'

In fact, he claimed, the earliest confirmed case of Covid in Wuhan - which occurred on December 8 - had no connection to any market within the city.

He added that samples taken from early cases at Huanan market showed slight variations in the virus, implying that it had been present in humans for an unknown length of time before causing those infections.

Putting forward other explanations for how the virus crossed into humans, Dr Wannian suggested that cats could have acted as an intermediary animal after cases were reported in felines around the world.

He also pointed to Covid infections in mink as evidence of another host animal, rather than bats or pangolins - both animals which are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and cooking.

He added that tens of thousands of PCR tests have been conducted on animals around China since the initial outbreak, including on domestically farmed animals, wild animals, and pets.

All of the tests came back negative, he said.

Dr Liang Wannian, China's lead researcher in Wuhan, instead pushed the theory that the virus could have been imported on frozen meats or animal products from overseas and called for more study

Who is on the WHO team investigating the origins of the coronavirus? The WHO unveiled a 10-strong panel in November tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus, including with this month's visit to China. They are: Thea Fischer, Denmark - Virologist and epidemiologist at University of Copenhagen and Nordsjaelland Hospital, previously worked at Denmark's State Serum Institute. Expert in epidemic control and vaccinology John Watson, UK - UK's deputy chief medical officer from 2013 to 2017, after helping lead response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also an honorary professor of epidemiology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Marion Koopmans, Netherlands - Dutch virologist who is head of the Erasmus Medical Centre department of viroscience in Rotterdam. Has written about spread of Covid-19 between humans and mink in Denmark Dominic Dwyer, Australia - Australian microbiologist at Westmead Clinical School in Sydney who helped grow the virus for research last February. Wants to investigate role of laboratories in the coronavirus outbreak Vladimir Dedkov, Russia - Epidemiologist and deputy director of research at the Institute Pasteur in Russia. Helped to diagnose Ebola patients during 2014 outbreak Hung Nguyen, Vietnam - Vietnamese biologist based at Kenya's International Livestock Research Institute who specialises in food safety risks in wet markets.

The WHO mission has been fraught from the start, first beset by delays and roadblocks thrown up by the Chinese government, and then later by claims that scientists were being fed little more than propaganda by Beijing authorities.

The experts spent one month in China, two weeks in quarantine, and then just two weeks on actual fieldwork.

Journalists were kept at arms' length during the visit while no official itinerary was published - and what little information did leak out was not promising.

For example, it was revealed that scientists spent just an hour at the Huanan Seafood Market but found time to visit a propaganda exhibition celebrating China's recovery from the pandemic.

They also appeared to spend several days inside their hotel receiving visits from various Chinese officials without going out into the city.

Deeper research was carried out at the Wuhan virology institute where they spent nearly four hours and said they met with Chinese scientists there including Shi Zhengli, one of China's leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan lab.

Former US president Donald Trump repeated a controversial theory that a lab leak may have been the source of the pandemic.

Scientists at the laboratory conduct research on some of the world's most dangerous diseases, including strains of bat coronaviruses similar to Covid-19.

Beijing is desperate to defang criticism of its handling of the chaotic early stages of the outbreak.

It has refocused attention at home - and abroad - on its handling of, and recovery from the outbreak.

Meanwhile an AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and prevented scientists from speaking to reporters.

The WHO team's mission is intended to be an initial step delving into the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in bats before being passed to humans through another species of wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat, which is considered an exotic delicacy by some in China.

Transmission through the trade in frozen products has emerged as a recent theory and has since become prevalent in China, and it appears WHO investigators also leaned towards the possibility.

Another member of the WHO team told The Associated Press late last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.

That expert, zoologist Peter Daszak, said the team looked into issues including what the first cases were, the link with animals and what, if any, the role that imports of frozen food may have played - a theory that China has long put forward.

The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate after China only agreed to it amid massive international pressure at the World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation.

While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal.

Summing up his time in China, Dr Embarek concluded: 'It was fascinating to realise that these people are not holding very exciting clues.

'When we talked to one of first cases, you immediately think they must have some very special habits, hiking in mountains, keeping wild pets at home, instead you realise they are very much like us - spending days on the internet, same jobs, activities and sports as many of us do.

'Illustrating how complicated this work is, it is not possible to come up with all answers after a few weeks of study.

'This needs to be done in a systematic way, building bit by bit to get answers, that is what we will continue to do with our Chinese colleagues.'

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

Australia's diplomatic relationship with China soured during the pandemic after Prime Minister Scott Morison called for the investigation into the origins of coronavirus, and the subsequent cover-ups which followed.

China retaliated by relentlessly targeting Australia in an increasingly aggressive and belligerent campaign of economic sanctions and blockades Beijing.

China imposed a litany of unofficial bans and arbitrary tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Australia exports after Canberra called for the inquiry.

Six of Australia's top beef distributors were hit with blanket bans along with cotton, timbre, seafood and coal producers.

The wine industry Down Under was hit with a crippling 212 per cent tariff - contravening the two nation's 2015 Free Trade agreement - while barely growers also had an 80 per cent barrier slapped on exports.

Australia is now preparing to take legal action against China at a World Trade Organisation tribunal, but the process to have the tariffs removed could take several years.

The WHO has previously come under fire from world leaders including ex-US President Trump for being 'China-centric' and uncritically parroting Beijing propaganda - playing down the severity of the disease until it was too late to stop it becoming a crippling pandemic.

Dr Tedros, the WHO chief, has also come in for heavy criticism for his praise of China - describing its 'commitment to transparency' as 'beyond words' during the early stages of the outbreak, despite strong doubts about data coming from Beijing and a past history of covering up potential pandemics.

It was also revealed that Dr Tedros received support from Beijing while in the running to become WHO chief, and that China has often donated large sums of money to governments or organisations that he has been a part of.

During his press conference, Dr Embarek also backed assertions from Beijing that there is no evidence of transmission 'in Wuhan or elsewhere' in China before December 2019 - despite multiple studies suggesting the virus was circulating globally months earlier than that.

Outlining the findings of his team's month-long study trip, Dr Embarek said the team had failed to establish where the virus came from or how it first jumped into humans. Instead, he said the team had come up with four theories about its origins.

Peter Embarek, lead researcher for WHO in Wuhan, has put forward four theories about how the virus infected humans: Direct transfer from source animal into people, transfer via an intermediary animal, transfer via food, and transfer via a lab leak (pictured, a chart showing the four routes)

Dr Embarek said his team has ruled out the possibility that the virus leaked from a lab such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology (pictured), saying such a leak is 'extremely unlikely' and should not be investigated further

China's official timeline vs new evidence Official timeline Dec 8, 2019 - Earliest date that China has acknowledged an infection Dec 31 - China first reported 'pneumonia of unknown cause' to the World Health Organisation Jan 1, 2020 - Wuhan seafood market closed for disinfection Jan 11 - China reported its first death Jan 23 - Wuhan locked down Jan 31 - WHO declared 'outbreak of international concern' as China admitted having thousands of cases Feb 23 - Italy reports cluster of cases in first major outbreak in the West New evidence Sep 2019- Blood samples are taken in a lung cancer screening trial in Italy which later test positive for coronavirus Oct-Dec - Rise in 'flu and pneumonia' cases in northern Italy which could be linked to coronavirus Nov - Sewage samples taken in Florianópolis, Brazil, suggest virus was present Nov 10 - Milanese woman has a skin biopsy, producing a sample which later shows signs of the virus Nov 17 - Leaked documents suggest case detected in China on this date Dec 1 - Chinese researchers report an infection on this date in a peer-reviewed study, but it has not been acknowledged by Beijing Dec 18 - Sewage samples taken in Milan and Turin suggest virus was circulating in the cities Jan 2020 - Sewage samples from Barcelona suggest virus was in the city Advertisement

He said the most likely explanation is that the virus passed from its original host animal into an intermediary animal that comes into close contact with humans, before making the leap into people.

Intermediary animals could include frozen or chilled animal products sold at markets in Wuhan, including those imported from overseas, he said, outlining his second theory.

The next most-likely theory is that the virus jumped directly from its original host into humans, Dr Embarek said, putting forward bats as a likely source.

But, he said, humans and bats do not come into close contact in Wuhan and swabs of bats and various other animal species in China - including wild animals, pets, and farm animals - has failed to find the original source.

Dr Embarek called for more research to be carried out into all three of these theories, and said teams should be looking outside as well as inside of China's borders.

The only theory he rejected out-of-hand was that the virus had leaked from a lab, saying such an event was 'extremely unlikely'.

Dr Liang Wannian, the head of China's Wuhan research team, further agreed - claiming that there is no evidence that Covid was present at any facility in China before appearing in humans.

If the virus was not present in a lab before the outbreak then it could not have escaped, he said.

Dr Wannian instead pushed the theory - which has become prevalent in China in recent weeks - that frozen food could have been the source, saying his research shows Covid can survive for a long time at low temperatures.

This means that the virus could have travelled long distances to reach Wuhan, he added, without specifically saying that it came from overseas.

He further revealed that Huanan Seafood Market - the market where the first cluster of Covid cases was detected - was not the only market in the city to be hit by the infection.

'While some of the early cases had close association with Huanan Seafood Market, others were associated with other markets,' he said, 'and other cases have no market association at all.

'It is likely that Huanan Market acted as focus for virus transmission, but the virus was also transmitted elsewhere at the same time. It is not possible on basis of current information to establish how the virus was introduced into Hunan market.'

In fact, he claimed, the earliest confirmed case of Covid in Wuhan - which occurred on December 8 - had no connection to any market within the city.

He added that samples taken from early cases at Huanan market showed slight variations in the virus, implying that it had been present in humans for an unknown length of time before causing those infections.

Putting forward other explanations for how the virus crossed into humans, Dr Wannian suggested that cats could have acted as an intermediary animal after cases were reported in felines around the world.

He also pointed to Covid infections in mink as evidence of another host animal, rather than bats or pangolins - both animals which are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and cooking.

He added that tens of thousands of PCR tests have been conducted on animals around China since the initial outbreak, including on domestically farmed animals, wild animals, and pets.

All of the tests came back negative, he said.

Dr Liang Wannian, China's lead researcher in Wuhan, instead pushed the theory that the virus could have been imported on frozen meats or animal products from overseas and called for more study

The WHO unveiled a 10-strong panel in November tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus, including with this month's visit to China. They are: Thea Fischer, Denmark - Virologist and epidemiologist at University of Copenhagen and Nordsjaelland Hospital, previously worked at Denmark's State Serum Institute. Expert in epidemic control and vaccinology John Watson, UK - UK's deputy chief medical officer from 2013 to 2017, after helping lead response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic.

The WHO mission has been fraught from the start, first beset by delays and roadblocks thrown up by the Chinese government, and then later by claims that scientists were being fed little more than propaganda by Beijing authorities.

The experts spent one month in China, two weeks in quarantine, and then just two weeks on actual fieldwork.

Journalists were kept at arms' length during the visit while no official itinerary was published - and what little information did leak out was not promising.

For example, it was revealed that scientists spent just an hour at the Huanan Seafood Market but found time to visit a propaganda exhibition celebrating China's recovery from the pandemic.

They also appeared to spend several days inside their hotel receiving visits from various Chinese officials without going out into the city.

Deeper research was carried out at the Wuhan virology institute where they spent nearly four hours and said they met with Chinese scientists there including Shi Zhengli, one of China's leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan lab.

Former US president Donald Trump repeated a controversial theory that a lab leak may have been the source of the pandemic.

Scientists at the laboratory conduct research on some of the world's most dangerous diseases, including strains of bat coronaviruses similar to Covid-19.

Beijing is desperate to defang criticism of its handling of the chaotic early stages of the outbreak.

It has refocused attention at home - and abroad - on its handling of, and recovery from the outbreak.

Meanwhile an AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and prevented scientists from speaking to reporters.

The WHO team's mission is intended to be an initial step delving into the origins of the virus, which is believed to have originated in bats before being passed to humans through another species of wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat, which is considered an exotic delicacy by some in China.

Transmission through the trade in frozen products has emerged as a recent theory and has since become prevalent in China, and it appears WHO investigators also leaned towards the possibility.

Another member of the WHO team told The Associated Press late last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.

That expert, zoologist Peter Daszak, said the team looked into issues including what the first cases were, the link with animals and what, if any, the role that imports of frozen food may have played - a theory that China has long put forward.

The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate after China only agreed to it amid massive international pressure at the World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation.

While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal.

Summing up his time in China, Dr Embarek concluded: 'It was fascinating to realise that these people are not holding very exciting clues.

'When we talked to one of first cases, you immediately think they must have some very special habits, hiking in mountains, keeping wild pets at home, instead you realise they are very much like us - spending days on the internet, same jobs, activities and sports as many of us do.

'Illustrating how complicated this work is, it is not possible to come up with all answers after a few weeks of study.

'This needs to be done in a systematic way, building bit by bit to get answers, that is what we will continue to do with our Chinese colleagues.'

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

Multiple countries have uncovered evidence that the virus was circulating months earlier than originally thought. While Beijing has tried to insist this proves the virus originated elsewhere, most scientists still think China was the origin - raising the prospect that communist officials simply hid evidence of the early spread",MailOnline,"['cases', 'wuhan', 'china', 'chinas', 'caused', 'including', 'beijing', 'team', 'claim', 'beef', 'animal', 'virus', 'investigators', 'covid19', 'australian', 'market', 'outbreak']",0

It is likely, although not confirmed, that Charles and Camilla would have had the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as did the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. A friend said Camilla seemed ‘very happy’.

Both Prince Charles and his son Prince William were struck down with Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic last year.

Charles has previously confirmed his intention to get vaccinated, but stressed that neither he – nor his wife – would expectany preferential treatment and would wait for their call as part of the over-70s group.

In December, Charles told staff administering the injection that he was ‘way down the list’ to receive it.

He made the admission as he visited the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in Gloucester to meet frontline health workers.

The royal told staff: ‘I think I’ll have to wait for the AstraZeneca one before it gets to my turn. I’m some way down the list and will have to wait.’

2021-02-09 17:00:09+00:00,3,"Losing your sense of smell – one of the symptoms of Covid-19 – can put you off sex, a new study reveals.

US researchers found a link between a loss of smell, known as anosmia, and decreased sexual motivation and emotional satisfaction in older US adults.

The experts say the sense of smell plays 'a uniquely strong role' in sexual motivation – and that both are 'intimately linked'.

Researchers only looked at adults aged 65 and older, meaning the link could only get stronger as we grow older and may be less pronounced in young adults.

Despite this, researchers say potentially treatable causes of sensory loss like should be addressed by clinicians to 'improve quality of life' – in other words, their sex life.

Loss of smell from Covid-19 does not appear to be permanent, scientists say, but can be an early symptom of the disease. Researchers say the loss of smell as a whole is linked to decreased sexual motivation

What is anosmia? Anosmia is the medical name for a condition in which someone suffers a complete or partial loss of their sense of smell. The most common single cause of the condition – temporary or permanent – is illnesses which affect the nose or sinuses, such as polyps which grow in the airways, fractured bones or cartilage, hay fever or tumours. It is different to hyposmia, which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells. Around 3.5 million people in the UK are affected by the condition, along with nearly 10 million in the US. It is surprisingly common and affects between three and five per cent of people. Head injuries and nervous system diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's may also contribute to the condition by damaging nerves in the nose which are responsible for detecting smells.

As we grow older, our sensory functions steadily decline, with various impacts for older adults.

Previous research has already suggested that smell disorder patients complain about impairments in their sexual life.

To learn more, researchers investigated the effect of a loss of the olfactory function, or sense of smell, has on older people's sexual desire and satisfaction.

The team, which also included an expert from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, worked with a sample of 2,084 older adults in the US, all aged 65 or older.

The adults, described as a 'nationally representative sample', were recruited from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal, population-based study of health and social factors.

The experts measured their olfactory sensitivity with smelling sticks and their frequency of sexual thoughts and sexual activity through a questionnaire, as well as satisfaction with their most recent sexual relationship.

'Decreased olfactory function in older US adults was associated with decreased sexual motivation and less emotional satisfaction with sex, but not decreased frequency of sexual activity or physical pleasure,' the researchers say.

However, a decrease in sensitivity of smell did not indicate a decreased frequency of sexual activity or a decrease in physical pleasure.

Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, education, cognition, comorbidities and depression – but the team could not determine causality, meaning it's not known if loss of smell causes decreased sex drive or vice versa.

Researchers only looked at adults aged 65 and older - meaning the link between loss of smell and low sex drive could only get stronger as we grow older and may be less pronounced in young adults

'Our research shows a decline in olfactory function may affect sexual pleasure in older adults,' said study author Jesse K. Siegel at the University of Chicago.

'Therefore, treatable causes of sensory loss should be addressed by clinicians to improve sexual health.'

The experts say this might be due to 'evolutionarily-conserved' neurological links between olfaction and sexuality.

'Olfaction has a strong, evolutionary-conserved connection to the limbic system, which plays a critical role in processing emotions and sexual motivation,' Siegel and her team say in their paper, published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine.

'Neurons in the olfactory bulb also project directly to the hypothalamus, another key mediator of sexual motivation.'

Study author Dr Jayant Pinto, also at the University of Chicago, told MailOnline that olfactory system is connected to centres in the brain that allow the experience of pleasure.

'These connections are ancient in that lower organisms need to detect chemicals in the environment [such as] nutrients to feed, toxins to avoid,' he said.

'As sexuality is essential for reproduction, this too depends on sensory input.

'Thus, the associations we find may be signs that these two old parts of our nervous system physiology are connected.

'The benefit would be more efficient mating and more progeny, in an evolutionary sense.'

The study was performed pre-Covid, meaning it's also not known how loss of smell in people with Covid specifically is linked to sexual desire.

The three most common symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new and continuous cough, and a loss or change to sense of smell or taste.

Public Health England also lists less several less common symptoms, including aches and pains, headache and a skin rash.

Generally, loss of sense 'may go back to normal in a few weeks or months', according to the NHS, and treatment with steroid nasal sprays or drops might help for people with sinusitis or nasal polyps.

However, people who have lost their sense of smell specifically due to Covid may not get it back two months later, a study from January suggested.

A study from last July also found one in ten people who lose their sense of taste and smell with the coronavirus may not get it back within a month.",MailOnline,"['sexual', 'smell', 'adults', 'sense', 'study', 'decreased', 'olfactory', 'loss', 'losing', 'sex', 'older', 'say']",0

The experts say the sense of smell plays 'a uniquely strong role' in sexual motivation – and that both are 'intimately linked'.

Researchers only looked at adults aged 65 and older, meaning the link could only get stronger as we grow older and may be less pronounced in young adults.

Despite this, researchers say potentially treatable causes of sensory loss like should be addressed by clinicians to 'improve quality of life' – in other words, their sex life.

Loss of smell from Covid-19 does not appear to be permanent, scientists say, but can be an early symptom of the disease. Researchers say the loss of smell as a whole is linked to decreased sexual motivation

What is anosmia? Anosmia is the medical name for a condition in which someone suffers a complete or partial loss of their sense of smell. The most common single cause of the condition – temporary or permanent – is illnesses which affect the nose or sinuses, such as polyps which grow in the airways, fractured bones or cartilage, hay fever or tumours. It is different to hyposmia, which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells. Around 3.5 million people in the UK are affected by the condition, along with nearly 10 million in the US. It is surprisingly common and affects between three and five per cent of people. Head injuries and nervous system diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's may also contribute to the condition by damaging nerves in the nose which are responsible for detecting smells.

As we grow older, our sensory functions steadily decline, with various impacts for older adults.

Previous research has already suggested that smell disorder patients complain about impairments in their sexual life.

To learn more, researchers investigated the effect of a loss of the olfactory function, or sense of smell, has on older people's sexual desire and satisfaction.

The team, which also included an expert from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, worked with a sample of 2,084 older adults in the US, all aged 65 or older.

The adults, described as a 'nationally representative sample', were recruited from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal, population-based study of health and social factors.

The experts measured their olfactory sensitivity with smelling sticks and their frequency of sexual thoughts and sexual activity through a questionnaire, as well as satisfaction with their most recent sexual relationship.

'Decreased olfactory function in older US adults was associated with decreased sexual motivation and less emotional satisfaction with sex, but not decreased frequency of sexual activity or physical pleasure,' the researchers say.

However, a decrease in sensitivity of smell did not indicate a decreased frequency of sexual activity or a decrease in physical pleasure.

Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, education, cognition, comorbidities and depression – but the team could not determine causality, meaning it's not known if loss of smell causes decreased sex drive or vice versa.

Researchers only looked at adults aged 65 and older - meaning the link between loss of smell and low sex drive could only get stronger as we grow older and may be less pronounced in young adults

'Our research shows a decline in olfactory function may affect sexual pleasure in older adults,' said study author Jesse K. Siegel at the University of Chicago.

'Therefore, treatable causes of sensory loss should be addressed by clinicians to improve sexual health.'

The experts say this might be due to 'evolutionarily-conserved' neurological links between olfaction and sexuality.

'Olfaction has a strong, evolutionary-conserved connection to the limbic system, which plays a critical role in processing emotions and sexual motivation,' Siegel and her team say in their paper, published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine.

'Neurons in the olfactory bulb also project directly to the hypothalamus, another key mediator of sexual motivation.'

Study author Dr Jayant Pinto, also at the University of Chicago, told MailOnline that olfactory system is connected to centres in the brain that allow the experience of pleasure.

'These connections are ancient in that lower organisms need to detect chemicals in the environment [such as] nutrients to feed, toxins to avoid,' he said.

'As sexuality is essential for reproduction, this too depends on sensory input.

'Thus, the associations we find may be signs that these two old parts of our nervous system physiology are connected.

'The benefit would be more efficient mating and more progeny, in an evolutionary sense.'

The study was performed pre-Covid, meaning it's also not known how loss of smell in people with Covid specifically is linked to sexual desire.

The three most common symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new and continuous cough, and a loss or change to sense of smell or taste.

Public Health England also lists less several less common symptoms, including aches and pains, headache and a skin rash.

Generally, loss of sense 'may go back to normal in a few weeks or months', according to the NHS, and treatment with steroid nasal sprays or drops might help for people with sinusitis or nasal polyps.

However, people who have lost their sense of smell specifically due to Covid may not get it back two months later, a study from January suggested.

A study from last July also found one in ten people who lose their sense of taste and smell with the coronavirus may not get it back within a month.",MailOnline,"['sexual', 'smell', 'adults', 'sense', 'study', 'decreased', 'olfactory', 'loss', 'losing', 'sex', 'older', 'say']",0
2021-02-09 14:35:04+00:00,5,"A single-dose COVID-19 vaccine developed by Chinese firm CanSino Biologics and a team led by Beijing's top military bio-warfare expert is reported to show 65.7 per cent efficacy in preventing symptomatic cases.

The drug also demonstrated a 90.98 per cent success rate in stopping severe disease in an interim analysis of global trials, according to Pakistan's health minister who posted the figures on Monday.

Chen Wei, a Major General of China's People's Liberation Army, headed a team of scientists from the Chinese military to work on the inoculation with CanSino Biologics (CanSinoBIO), a biotechnology company based in Tianjin and listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Ms Chen, 54, is a leading specialist in genetic engineering vaccines in China.

She was at the centre of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 early last year after some reports claimed that she had been appointed to take over Wuhan Institute of Virology, which carries out research into coronaviruses.

Chinese state media reported on Monday that Ms Chen was appointed by the Chinese military to co-develop the single-jab regimen, leading her team from the Institute of Bio-engineering of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.

She is also known in the country as the 'terminator of Ebola' for directing specialists to create a vaccine against the fatal virus.

Speaking of fighting the novel coronavirus, Chen told state media from Wuhan in January last year: 'The epidemic is like a military situation. The epicentre equals to the battlefield.'

The positive data from the final-stage trials of CanSinoBIO's vaccine moves the treatment a step closer to becoming China's third successful shot for the disease.

Although COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese developers have shown lower protection rates than some Western ones, and no detailed study results are publicly available yet, they have already been approved in several developing countries battling a surge in coronavirus infections.

The CanSinoBIO vaccine is being tested in Pakistan, Mexico, Russia, Argentina and Chile, according to clinical trial registration data, and the company has supply deals with some of those countries, including Mexico.

In a statement from February 1, CanSinoBIO said 40,000 participants had received the vaccine during its phase III clinical trial carried out at 78 research centres in five countries.

Pakistan's health minister, Faisal Sultan, had said that the country could receive 'in the range of tens of millions' of the vaccine under an agreement with the Chinese firm.

Hassan Abbas, head of the CanSinoBIO's trial at AJ Pharma in Pakistan, said it has already applied to the government for permission to import the vaccine.

Pakistan's health minister, Faisal Sultan, had previously said that the country could receive 'in the range of tens of millions' of the CanSinoBIO vaccine under an agreement with the Chinese firm. The picture shows a COVID-19 vaccine counter in Peshawar, Pakistan, on February 03

'The initial set of vaccines will come in vials already filled, but we hope in the future to get them in the form of concentrates from CanSino, and do the filling here in Pakistan,' he told Reuters.

The efficacy of the shot is based on analysis of 30,000 participants and 101 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the minister said on Twitter, quoting data from an independent data monitoring committee.

It was not immediately clear whether the study also looked into the vaccine's efficacy against new and highly transmissible variants first found in South Africa, Britain and Brazil.

No serious safety concerns have been raised in the study, Sultan said.

In the Pakistani subset, efficacy of the CanSinoBIO vaccine at preventing symptomatic cases was 74.8 per cent and 100 per cent at preventing severe disease, Sultan added.

Harvey, 18 – who is on the autism spectrum and was born with disabilities including partial blindness, ADHD and Prader-Willi syndrome – is recovering at home with his family from a allergic reaction to the vaccine last week.

And in a new video posted on Instagram on Monday, Katie, 42, shared a clip of her son thanking those who supported him while the pair enjoyed some playful banter.

Gratitude: Katie Price's son Harvey dedicated a thank-you message to his army of well-wishers on Monday, after he was hospitalised following a reaction to his COVID-19 jab

At the start of the heartwarming clip, former glamour model Katie is heard saying to her eldest son: 'Make me laugh... Say something funny.'

'Hello, egg,' he said, complying with his famous mother's request, before he made his mother gasp by adding: 'Hello, d***head.'

After apologising, the teen was seen excitedly receiving a serving of cheesecake from Katie's partner Carl Woods as he relaxed on the sofa.

'Are you happy?' doting mother Katie enquired, as she informed him: 'Mummy's gonna do this post for Instagram.'

Update: Katie Price took to Instagram with Harvey by her side on Sunday as she revealed he suffered a reaction after taking the first of his Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs on Friday

'Oh yeah, mum. I'm so happy, mum,' Harvey adorably responded, before he said to his supporters: 'Thank you, everyone. I love you, everyone.'

Meanwhile, Katie revealed that doesn't want her son Harvey's experience to put people off having the coronavirus vaccine.

She told The Sun: 'I am in awe of the NHS - they are amazing, without them Harvey would not be here today. I don't want anyone worrying about him as he’s fine now at home eating carrot cake.

'Despite Harvey's reaction, he is one of a kind, the COVID jab is so important especially for those in high risk categories. I am so much happier in the knowledge Harvey is safer now he has had his.'

However, Katie has called for 'strict medical supervision' and monitoring for those who suffer with 'complex and rare conditions' when they have their vaccination.

Her representative said: 'Katie would like the medical authorities to consider those with complex and rare conditions should be vaccinated under strict medical supervision and monitored for 24hrs as their immune systems can react differently.

'Treatment can then be administered immediately. This would be subject to the resources being made available for this.'

The video comes after Katie revealed that Harvey is home and well, after he was rushed to hospital following a bad reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.

The former glamour model took to her Instagram Stories with her son by her side on Sunday as she revealed he suffered a reaction after taking the first of his Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs on Friday.

Video: 'Hello, egg,' he said at the start of the video, complying with his famous mother's request to 'say something funny', before he made his mother gasp by adding. 'Hello, d***head'

And the mother-of-five revealed that once she got her eldest son home from the hospital, he was back 'on form', requesting chicken Kiev and chips at 4am.

'Harvey is all good, she told her army of followers. 'Thank you for all your kind messages and best wishes for Harvey he is home, safe and well.'

She then went on to discuss Harvey's apparent reaction to the vaccine, saying: 'So because of Harvey's complex needs and the complex medication that he's on he had his COVID [vaccine], the Oxford one, and had just as reaction.

'The reaction was a really, really high temperature, 39.9 [degrees]. And obviously with Harvey, I have to keep a really keen eye and I couldn't get his temperature down.

'So I phoned Great Ormond Street and they told me to go to the nearest A&E that's what we did. Did all your bloods, did an X-ray, blood, ECG, everything.

Home and safe: The video comes after Katie revealed that Harvey is home and well, after he was rushed to hospital following a bad reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine

'Everything was fine, said it was just a reaction from COVID but today, he's absolutely on form, aren't you?

'And the doctors and nurses were fantastic so I can't wait to still have my COVID injection and I still recommend everyone else have it and Harvey is safe and well.'

Elsewhere in the video, Katie went on to reveal that Harvey was so much back to his old self that he had a decadent culinary request in the early hours of Sunday.

After prompting him to share that he was in hospital the night before, she said: 'What did you ask for at four o'clock this morning? Chicken Kiev and chips!'

Katie also encouraged others to still go ahead with getting the Covid vaccine, saying that despite Harvey's reaction it's still so important for high risk people to have it.

While her rep added: 'Katie would like the medical authorities to consider those with complex and rare conditions should be vaccinated under strict medical supervision and monitored for 24hrs as their immune systems can react differently.'

Harvey also sweetly thanked his mum's followers for all their well wishes after the scary dash to hospital in a video shared on Instagram on Sunday evening.

The update came after she was said to be 'worried to bits' after her son Harvey was rushed to hospital with 'uncontrollable shaking' on Saturday.

Hours earlier, Harvey, who is on the autism spectrum and was born with disabilities including partial blindness, ADHD and Prader-Willi syndrome, received his first COVID vaccine, having been declared clinically extremely vulnerable.

A source told The Sun: 'Katie's in bits, Harvey only had the jab on Friday but now doctors who know Harvey well are telling her he's had a bad reaction to it - it can't be anything else.

'She's very worried but is trying to remain calm. It's dangerous as he hasn't got cortisol in his body to fight like us.'

It came just hours after Katie expressed her relief and joy as Harvey received an early COVID-19 vaccine on Friday.

Due to his health conditions, Harvey is considered a vulnerable citizen, and he is now immunised in the fourth stage of the vaccine roll-out, orchestrated by the government.

It also comes after Katie revealed she's got her son a three-bedroom house to help prepare him to go to residential college full-time, which is across the road from her home in Surrey.

In the video, Katie and Harvey sat on the sofa in the living room of his new home.

Katie explained: 'So I've got this house for Harvey. Basically it's a three bedroom house I got him for all he needs. I've been doing it up a little bit for him.

Protected: The teen, who is on the autism spectrum and was born with disabilities including partial blindness, ADHD and Prader-Willi syndrome, had the Oxford AstraZeneca injection

'I've got it for him before he goes to residential to get used to the transition. And yes he's already made some holes in the walls and stuff, which I keep plastering. I'm trying to keep on top of everything and make it a nice home for him.

'As you can see there's bits and that everywhere but next time we will give you a tour of Harvey's new home.'

Katie believes the move is vital for Harvey's well-being because she can no longer restrain the at 6ft2in and 29 stone teen if he has a mood swing - and fears he could be sectioned if she doesn't act now.

She also said Harvey is excited about the prospect of going into a full-time college, after previously going to a residential college five days a week.",MailOnline,"['katie', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'video', 'thanks', 'reaction', 'vaccine', 'revealed', 'wellwishers', 'son', 'prices', 'harvey', 'covid19', 'harveys', 'covid', 'jab']",0
2021-02-06 01:20:03+00:00,7,"Climate change may have driven the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, a new study claims.

UK researchers say global greenhouse gas emissions over the last century have driven growth of forest habitat favoured by bats.

This has made southern China, in particular the Chinese Yunnan province, a 'global hotspot' for bat-borne coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2.

Bats act as reservoirs of numerous zoonotic viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS CoV and the Ebola virus.

It's been thought the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from bats, although scientists are still debating the origins of the disease, which may not ever be officially confirmed.

World Health Organisation investigators admitted this week that their research mission in Wuhan will not reach its goal of revealing how coronavirus jumped from animals to humans.

It is likely to have its ancestral origins in a bat species but may have reached humans through an intermediary species, such as pangolins – a scaly mammal often confused for a reptile.

Estimated increase in the local number of bat species due to shifts in their geographical ranges driven by climate change since 1901. The zoomed-in area represents the likely spatial origin of the bat-borne ancestor of SARS-CoV-2

Despite this, the study authors claim the first evidence of a mechanism by which climate change could have played a direct role in the development of the current pandemic.

'Climate change over the last century has made the habitat in the southern Chinese Yunnan province suitable for more bat species,' said study author Dr Robert Beyer from the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology.

'Understanding how the global distribution of bat species has shifted as a result of climate change may be an important step in reconstructing the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak.'

In the southern Chinese Yunnan province, and adjacent regions in Myanmar and Laos, there have been 'large-scale changes' in vegetation in the last century, the study found.

Did SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats? Researchers from the University of Cambridge think so, and say bats may have been allowed to proliferate due to climate change

WHO admit Wuhan research mission WILL NOT reveal how Covid jumped from animals to humans World Health Organisation (WHO) investigators have admitted their research mission in Wuhan will not reach its goal of revealing how coronavirus jumped from animals to humans. The 13-strong team of international experts began their probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic a week ago - but it was revealed today they are already dismissing some theories that the virus was leaked by a Chinese laboratory. Lead WHO investigator Peter Ben Embarek said their investigation, which is due to conclude within by the second week of February, would not lead to a 'full understanding' of the origins of coronavirus. He said: 'We're not going to come up with the ultimate full understanding of the origins of the virus, but it will be a good first step.' But Embarek insisted he and his team had a 'very frank' discussion with Chinese scientists about the source of the pandemic.

Climate changes including increases in temperature, sunlight, and atmospheric carbon dioxide – which stimulates plant and tree growth – have changed natural habitats from tropical shrubland to tropical savannah and deciduous woodland.

This has created a suitable environment for many coronavirus-carrying bat species that predominantly live in forests to thrive.

The study found that an additional 40 bat species have moved into the southern Chinese Yunnan province in the past century, harbouring around 100 more types of bat-borne coronavirus.

This 'global hotspot' is the region where genetic data suggests SARS-CoV-2 may have arisen, and been borne by bats to the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, where it was transmitted to humans just over a year ago.

To get their results, the researchers created a map of the world's vegetation as it was a century ago, using records of temperature, precipitation and cloud cover.

Then they used information on the vegetation requirements of the world's bat species to work out the global distribution of each species in the early 1900s.

Comparing this to current distributions allowed them to see how bat 'species richness' – the number of different species – has changed across the globe over the last century due to climate change.

'As climate change altered habitats, species left some areas and moved into others –taking their viruses with them,' said Dr Beyer.

'This not only altered the regions where viruses are present, but most likely allowed for new interactions between animals and viruses, causing more harmful viruses to be transmitted or evolve.'

Researchers say the number of coronaviruses in an area is closely linked to the number of different bat species present.

The study has revealed large-scale changes in the type of vegetation in the southern Chinese Yunnan province. Pictured, the Jiulong waterfall, Yunnan, China

The world's bat population carries around 3,000 different types of coronavirus, with each bat species harbouring an average of 2.7 coronaviruses – most without showing symptoms.

Over the last century, climate change has also driven increases in the number of bat species in regions around Central Africa, and scattered patches in Central and South America, the study also found.

An increase in the number of bat species in a particular region, driven by climate change, may increase the likelihood that a coronavirus harmful to humans is present, transmitted, or evolves there.

Most coronaviruses carried by bats cannot jump into humans, but several coronaviruses known to infect humans are 'very likely' to have originated in bats.

This includes three than can cause human fatalities – Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-1 and CoV-2.

The SARS outbreak of 2002 to 2004 was caused by the SARS-CoV-1 virus strain which was first identified in Guangdong, China in 2002.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, late last year there's been much uncertainty surrounding the virus's origin.

A previous report from scientists said the virus is 96 per cent identical to one found in bats, although this is yet to be officially confirmed as the source.

While it was initially assumed that the virus passed to humans in a Wuhan wet market, other studies have pointed to an anteater-like animal called a pangolin being the intermediary animal.

Pangolins are mammals but are often confused for reptiles due to their scaly appearance. They're consumed as food in China and are also used in traditional medicine.

Yunnan, the region identified by the new study as a hotspot for a climate-driven increase in bat species richness, is also home to pangolins, however.

It's possible the virus jumped from bats to Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) and masked palm civits (Paguma larvata) in Yunnan.

They were then captured and transported more than 2,000 kilometres to Wuhan, where they were sold at a wildlife market, say the authors of the new study, which has been published today in the journal Science of the Total Environment.

SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have its ancestral origins in a bat species but may have reached humans through an intermediary species, such as pangolins – a scaly mammal often confused for a reptile (pictured)

'Captured civets and pangolins carrying these viruses are likely to have been transported to wildlife markets in Guangdong and Wuhan, respectively, where the initial outbreaks in human populations occurred.'

The researchers echo calls from previous studies that urge policy-makers to acknowledge the role of climate change in outbreaks of viral diseases.

Policy-makers should also address climate change as part of Covid-19 economic recovery programmes, they say.

'The Covid-19 pandemic has caused tremendous social and economic damage. Governments must seize the opportunity to reduce health risks from infectious diseases by taking decisive action to mitigate climate change,' said co-author of the study, Professor Andrea Manica, also at Cambridge.

'The fact that climate change can accelerate the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans should be an urgent wake-up call to reduce global emissions,' added Professor Camilo Mora at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, who initiated the project.

Climate change 'could have played a direct role' in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (pictured), the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic, according to University of Cambridge research

The researchers emphasised the need to limit the expansion of urban areas, farmland, and hunting grounds into natural habitat to reduce contact between humans and disease-carrying animals.

Professor Paul Valdes at the Cabot Institute for the Environment at University of Bristol, who was not involved with the study, called the findings 'interesting' but pointed out some drawbacks.

'There are many untested aspects of their conclusions, especially since we are still debating the origins of Covid,' he said.

'They show that climate change may have had a small impact on the biodiversity of bat species in Yunnan but this is more than 2,000 kilometres away from Wuhan and the link between the two regions is not discussed.

'Moreover, habitat loss is likely to have played a much larger role in biodiversity change than any small effect from climate change and this is not incorporated into their model.

'It therefore seems premature to conclude that climate change has had a big effect on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.'",MailOnline,"['species', 'climate', 'bat', 'wuhan', 'driven', 'change', 'study', 'sarscov2', 'emergence', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'yunnan', 'humans']",0

America recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic yet on Thursday, with a staggering 5,077 fatalities in 24 hours, dwarfing the previous record of 4,466 deaths on January 12 by 611.

It comes despite encouraging and sustained declines in daily coronavirus infections. At 121,645, the average number of new daily infections is half what it was at the peak of the pandemic, on January 12, according to a DailyMail.com analysis of Johns Hopkins University data.

But the trend in fatalities consistently lags weeks behind trends in cases and hospitalizations, which have both been falling for the past three weeks, with fewer than 90,000 people getting inpatient treatment for COVID-19 for the first time since Thanksgiving, COVID Tracking Project data shows.

Hospitalizations fall after cases, and deaths are expected to follow hospitalizations, despite yesterday's record-high fatalities.

CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said earlier in the week that 'the pace of deaths appears to be slowing.'

On Friday she said: 'Early data suggest now we're starting to see this, with the 7-day average of deaths declining 6.7 percent to slightly more than 3,00 deaths a day from jan 28 to feb 3.'

Meanwhile, experts are encouraged, but perplexed by the decline in infections. Vanderbilt University infectious diseases professor Dr William Shaffner told DailyMail.com he is 'bumfuzzled' by what's driving the trend.

It's too soon for vaccines to be a significant driver of the downturn; just 8.7 percent of the US population has had one or more shots, according to Bloomberg data, and the US is nowhere near herd immunity yet.

And while CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky called this week's encouraging downward trend in cases 'consistent,' Dr Shaffner echoed her warnings that the trend could be reversed by the arrival of variants and potential super-spreader events, like Super Bowl Sunday.

Already, there are at least 645 cases of the UK's 'super-covid' variant in 33 states, at least five cases of the South African variant and two of the Brazilian variant in the US, in addition to several homegrown variants.

More than 5,077 people died of COVID-19 on Thursday, shattering the previous record of 4,466 fatalities on January 12

The average number of new infections a day has declined consistently over the past three weeks, with just 122,473 recorded on Thursday

Hospitalizations have also falled below 90,000 for the first time since November 27, as pictured above

Holidays led to the last surge of infections that followed the triple-threat of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve.

With the lags between infections, hospitalizations and deaths, yesterday's record fatalities likely still reflect patients infected in that period.

At least 645 cases of 'super COVID' variants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa have been reported in 33 states At least 645 cases of coronavirus variants from the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been reported across 33states. Of that number, at least 626 have been linked to the UK variant known as B 1.1.7. a DailyMail.com analysis of state and federal data reveals. More than half of those cases have been reported in Florida and California, and there are two deaths linked to the strain, one in New Jersey and one in Alabama. Experts have warned that this variant is expected to become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March. There are currently five cases of the B.1.351 variant, which was first detected in South Africa, three of which are in Maryland and two in South Carolina. In addition, two cases of the P.1 strain that originated Brazil have been identified in Minnesota. Advertisement

'Just as we are smiling,' about the downturn in cases 'there are a couple of three countervailing factors,' Dr Shaffner told DailyMail.com.

'The arrival of variants could create more cases, more illnesses and hospitalizations down the road.

'The second factor is Super Bowl Sunday. We expect anticipate many families parties where people gather together for prolonged periods, cheering lustily or groaning mightily, depending on which team is doing what, and those are ideal circumstances for spreading [the virus].

'Super Bowl Sunday may become a super-spreader event all over the country.'

The last massive surge of infections in January may mean slightly fewer people are vulnerable now because they were previously infected, the US is long way off from herd immunity.

Scientists estimate that as many as 100 million Americans, or about a third of the population, have had COVID-19. At least 70 percent of the population needs to have protection from prior infection or vaccines to reach herd immunity.

Daily COVID-19 cases have been falling steadily over the past three weeks with only 123,907 new infections reported on Thursday.

The seven-day average has dropped to 130,569, as hospitalizations have also fallen to 88,668.

Nationwide, there have been more than 26.6million American infected with COVID-19 and 455,735 deaths.

The drop in new cases and hospitalizations comes as the vaccine rollout continues and as many states maintain mask mandates and social distancing requirements in public spaces. It also comes as the U.S. gets one step closer to having a single-dose coronavirus vaccine.

According to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, between the peak on January 12 and February 4, the the seven-day average for cases has fallen nationwide by 47.5 percent.

The number of tests being taken has fallen also, but only by 12.7 percent, not enough to quantify the drop in cases.

The effects of the decrease in cases is being felt across the country, with no state recording a seven-day average of more than 20,000 on Thursday.

This is the first time in weeks that the average remained under the 20,000 threshold in every state.

The state that came the closest is Texas which has a seven-day average of 19,637 new cases.

California was second with an average of 15,405. In mid-January, an average of 42,000 new cases a day was being reported in the state.

For the first time in weeks, the seven-day average is below 20,000 in all states. Texas has the highest average at 19,634

The drop in new cases and hospitalizations comes as the vaccine rollout continues. Pictured, a first responder vaccinates a woman in her car in New Hampshire on Thursday as 121,645 new infections were reported nationwide

Florida, Georgia, New York, and North Carolina on Thursday all reported an average between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases.

The average is between 1,000 and 5,000 in 24 states, between 500 and 1,000 in nine states, and between 1 and 500 in the remaining 12 states.

Hawaii has the lowest seven-day average at 98 cases.

Last week, there were fewer than one million infections recorded in the U.S in a week for the first time in two months.

Over the last seven days, from January 28 to February 3, 934,661 COVID-19 cases were reported in the U.S., a DailyMail.com analysis shows.

This is the first time that the weekly total has been six figures since early November, when a total of 962,560 cases were recorded between November 7 and November 14.

Forty-four states are seeing a decline in cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

While the death toll in the U.S. from COVID-19 still remains high, new models from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also predict that February could see 38,000 fewer deaths than last month.

The CDC published new 'ensemble' forecasts, which combines 37 independent forecasts of coronavirus deaths over the next four weeks into one projection.

On the low end of the projection, the forecast suggests that 496,000 deaths could be reported by February 27, which is 38,679 fewer COVID-19 deaths than the 93,435 fatalities that were reported in January.

Case and hospitalizations are both on the decrease, with fewer than 90,000 people hospitalized on Thursday

But on the high end of the projection, the death toll could rise of as many as 534,000 deaths, which would mean February would record just 679 fewer deaths than were recorded in January.

The forecast also predicts that between 11,300 and 22,600 deaths from the virus will be reported each week for the next four weeks.

If the death toll reaches 534,000, it means more people in the U.S. will have died from COVID-19 than the number of people who live in Atlanta.

The figure will also be greater than the number of lives lost in the U.S. to Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, the flu, pneumonia, and strokes combined.

America's death toll is the highest in the world despite the country accounting for less than five percent of the global population.

The decline in cases is coming as the U.S. gets one step closer to having a single-dose coronavirus vaccine.

Johnson & Johnson asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to authorize its vaccine on Thursday night.

Now that it has submitted its application for emergency use authorization, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine could be greenlit within weeks.

The US has an agreement, signed last year under the Trump administration, for 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, which the company says it can deliver by June, pending authorization.

The drug maker’s application to the FDA follows its January 29 report in which it said the vaccine had a 66 percent rate of preventing infections in its large global trial.

The shot is also 57 percent effective in South Africa, where a variant of the virus that dulls vaccine effectiveness is spreading.

If regulators approve the vaccine, it would be the third shot made available to the American public after vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc were approved in December.

J&J's single-shot vaccine could help boost supply and simplify the U.S. immunization campaign - and bring President Joe Biden closer to his goal of 150 million shots in arms in the first 100 days of his term.

It emerged on Thursday that Biden may also be considering sending masks to every single household in the U.S.

Officials told NBC News that the White House's COVID-19 Response Team is currently assessing different ways of mailing face coverings to 328 million Americans.

It is currently unclear how much the plan will cost, how many masks would be sent to each household, what types of masks would be included in the package and if people are required to receive them.

Although the plan has been discussed by the administration's top public health experts, no final proposal has been sent to Biden for approval.

Cancer survivor Terry Mills, 38, originally from Devon, caught Covid-19 during a business trip to Cancun which later developed into pneumonia.

EastEnders star and close friend Max Bowden announced Terry's death on Instagram today, saying: 'I will love you until my last breath'. It is thought Terry died in hospital in Mexico.

The Big Talent Group chief looked after clients including TOWIE'S Yazmin Oukhellou, Gogglebox's Amy Tapper, and Callum Izzard from Ibiza Weekender and was well liked within showbiz circles.

His friends had set up the fundraising page to pay for the 'astronomical' cost of treatment costs as well as a flight home, with stars including Natalie Cassidy, Amy Tapper, Alison Hammond, Max Bowden, Gillian Taylforth, Letitia Dean and Chizzy Akudolu chipping in.

Sharing a heartfelt tribute, Max, who plays Ben Mitchell in EastEnders, wrote: 'I will love you until my last breath. You took me in when no one else would have me. You looked after me, and protected me when I was at my lowest. You nurtured me and helped me see light. You sprayed my feet when they were stinking out the house.

'All you did was care about the people you loved. When things got bad, we’d cuddle each other on that sofa in Marylebone like two toddlers, and tell each other we’ve got this. You battled everything, daily, and won. And this time this c*** of a virus got you. But you still fought. I don’t know a life without you.

'I don’t want a life without you. But I know you’ll be with me. You made my family feel like they were the only people in the world. I will never forget when you ran down the red carpet at the NTAs to make my Nan feel like a queen. The last messages we sent each other before you fell ill, were that we loved each other. And I always will Tel.

'Thank you for every thing you gave me. My life will never be the same. Sleep well, my wonderful friend (sic).'

It is not clear when Terry travelled to Mexico, which has counted more than 1.7 million Covid-19 cases and more than 150,000 deaths, and earlier this month experienced a record spike that saw cases daily double to 21,366 within a week.

Due to low levels of testing, experts believe the true death count could be closer to 200,000.

Close friend Max Bowden, who plays Ben Mitchell in EastEnders, shared a touching tribute

The fundraising page had explained: 'The hospital have told family and friends if Terry was to have any chance of survival he had to be induced into a coma and placed on a ventilator for a minimum of ten days, plus recovery care beyond that, and a flight to bring them home to England.

'The cost is astronomical, but you can't put a price on a person's life and we are at the mercy of the Playa Med Hospital in Cancun.

'We've clubbed together and thrown everything we have at this so far in order to buy Terry a hospital bed where he has been receiving oxygen and antibiotics, but his condition worsened and the doctors said he had to be put on a ventilator if he is to survive this.

'We're frightened. We want to be there holding Terry's hand but we're not allowed and we need to raise another £100,000 within the next ten days to pay for this life-saving treatment.'

The campaign to pay for Terry's treatment was supported by starts including Britain's Got Talent winner Richard Jones (pictured with Terry) as well as Kate and Rio Ferdinand

The page was set up to raise £100,000 in just ten days for Terry (pictured with journalist friend Sarah-Louise Robertson) after his friends were told his insurance only covered the first 24 hours of care

It is not clear when Terry (pictured at a recent charity event) travelled to Mexico on the business trip

It said that the group had contacted the British Consulate which had done as much as it could, but concluded that the final cost for medical care lies with the patient.

It continued: 'Imagine if it was your other half, child, sibling, friend, lying there in a strange hospital thousands of miles from home not understanding what doctors are saying to them, not allowed to have anybody with them on the ward for the fear of contagion of Covid-19.

'You'd do everything you could to save them. You wouldn't want them to die, alone, simply because they did not have enough money to pay for medical care.

'We are so lucky to have our wonderful NHS.

'Times are hellish for all our families and the whole world in this brutal pandemic, but if you can spare anything, even the smallest amount of change it can help buy our darling Terry more time to let the doctors do their work and save their life, so we hopefully can bring him home to us.'

The GoFundMe page was set up by Terry's friends - Sarah-Louise (pictured together), Cat and Sam

Terry's cousin Emma Mills told Femail that from the moment Terry first displayed symptoms to being placed into an induced coma was a matter of days.

She said: 'He began displaying symptoms on the Monday.

'Then on the Saturday, the hospital said that if he was to have any chance of survival he had to be induced into a coma and placed on a ventilator for a minimum of 10 days.'

Last year, Terry, who was previously a radio presenter on ExmouthAiR, beat cancer.

His former boss, ExmouthAiR's Station Manager Andy Green, took to Facebook with a tribute that read: 'We are all deeply shocked at ExmouthAiR to hear this news, Terry is a colourful, lovely bubbly character who was an integral part of our early trial broadcasts who brought so much joy and energy to the airwaves.

2021-02-03 22:39:15+00:00,11,"Mexico has approved emergency use of Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, just a week after President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who is battling a coronavirus infection, reached an agreement for its purchase with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Deputy Health Minister Hugo López-Gatell said on Tuesday that the contract calls for millions of doses of the vaccine.

López-Gatell said Mexico's contract calls for the delivery of 7.4 million doses between February and April, with more due in May.

""This gives us an enormous opportunity to accelerate vaccination in Mexico,"" said López-Gatell, during a morning press conference before announcing later in the day that Mexican health regulator COFEPRIS had authorized Sputnik V for emergency use.

According to data from John Hopkins University, the coronavirus pandemic has slammed Mexico with 159,333 confirmed deaths - the third-most in the world - and 1,874,092 cases.

Mexico announced Tuesday the approval for the emergency use of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine. The government expects to received 7.4 million doses between February and April. Mexico has registered 159,333 confirmed coronavirus deaths - third-most in the world.

Mexico became the first country in Latin America to officer a vaccine for a virus, rolling out the Pfizer vaccine in December.

López-Gatell also announced the second phase of the vaccination process, welcoming people of the age of 60. A website set up for registration crashed Tuesday night after more than 70,000 people had signed up.

The third phase will cover people between the ages of 50 to 59 from April to May, and the following phase will take place from May until June targeting those who fall between the ages of 40 to 49.

A fifth and final phase will commence in June and last until March 2022 in which the rest of the population will be eligible to receive the vaccine.

Mexico is trying to secure as much vaccine supply as possible for its 126 million people following delays of some products amid a global scramble for vaccines.

Gravediggers on Tuesday buried a victim of COVID-19 at a cemetery in Ecatepec, a city in State of Mexico. As of Wednesday, the virus had killed 159,333 people in Mexico

Latin American nations, including Argentina and Mexico, showed an early interest in locking down supplies of the Russian vaccine. In December, the makers of Sputnik V requested to carry out clinical trials in Mexico.

Global interest in Sputnik V was bolstered on Tuesday after peer-reviewed results from its late-stage clinical trial were published in The Lancet international medical journal.

Sputnik V was 91.6% effective in preventing people from developing COVID-19, according to those results.

Requiring two shots, Sputnik V has been approved for storage in normal fridges, rather than freezers, according to scientists at the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow that developed it.

In the meantime, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been proven to be 94.1% effective against the virus while the Pfizer vaccine has an effectiveness rate of 95%.

This ease of transportation and distribution has appealed to Mexico, which has hard-to-reach rural areas and a struggling national healthcare system.

López Obrador spoke with Putin last Monday about buying 24 million doses of the vaccine.

2021-02-03 16:15:07+00:00,3,"Athletes have been warned they could be sent home from the Olympics for serious breaches of coronavirus protocols with attendees banned from singing, hugging and shaking hands.

Tokyo 2020 organisers on Wednesday released their first 'playbook' of rules that those involved at the Games must follow to ensure a 'safe and successful' event this summer.

The first version produced is for sports federations and officials, but it was confirmed the publications for athletes, media and spectators will follow the 'same framework'.

Athletes are not required to get the Covid vaccination before flying out to the Olympics

Under the section entitled 'principles', the playbook says 'avoid physical contact, including hugs and handshakes' and 'support athletes by clapping and not singing or chanting'.

In theory, this means athletes cannot have sex in the Olympic Village — something which is usually rife — and they may not even be allowed to sing their national anthem on the podium, although that is unlikely to be enforced.

A decision on whether spectators can attend the Games will not be taken until the spring, but if crowds are allowed it is expected they too will be stopped from singing and shouting.

Athletes must be tested 72 hours before leaving for Japan, and then again on arrival

Athletes will be tested for Covid-19 every four days. Competitors and officials can only leave their accommodation to go to official venues and they cannot use public transport.

They 'must not visit Games venues as a spectator' and 'must not visit tourist areas, shops, restaurants or bars' — putting an end to post-event parties.

The playbook goes on to warn: 'Non-respect of the rules may have an impact on your participation to the Games, your access to Games venues and, in some cases, on your participation to competitions.

There have been growing fears over the Olympics not taking place amid the ongoing crisis

'Repeated or serious failures to comply with these rules may result in the withdrawal of your accreditation and right to participate in the Olympic and Paralympic Games.'

Covid-19 liaison officers will be appointed to ensure protocols are being followed and Christophe Dubi, the International Olympic Committee executive director, added: 'We do not anticipate many breaches of the rules but if there are, there will be a procedure in place.

'If push comes to shove and we have to activate the disciplinary commission, then this will be done. The rules are simple and are there for everyone to be safe.'

Attendees will be required to present proof of a negative Covid-19 test upon arrival in Japan for the rearranged Games, but they will not have to quarantine and vaccination is not mandatory.

They will have to download Japan's contact-tracing app and complete an 'activity plan' detailing all of their movements for their first 14 days in the country, including travel and accommodation plans.

Anyone who tests positive will have to isolate, possibly in a 'government-approved isolation facility'.

Organisers are adamant that the Games will go ahead this summer despite the continued spread of coronavirus and the state of emergency in Tokyo being extended for another month to March 7.

Dubi added: 'We each have our part to play. That's why these playbooks have been created — with the rules that will make each and every one of us a sound, safe and active contributor to the Games.

'We know these Olympic Games will be different in a number of ways. For all Games participants, there will be some conditions and constraints that will require flexibility and understanding.'

Ten panda cubs have met the public for the first time after being born during the coronavirus pandemic at a Chinese breeding centre.

The fluffy baby bears, aged from four to six months, frolicked among Chinese lanterns and traditional decorative ornaments at a festive debut ceremony on Wednesday.

Their keepers wished the public a happy Lunar Near Year as they posed for a group photo holding the cubs on a playground in south-western China.

All of the cubs were born to parents that had mated naturally at the Shenshuping Panda Base in Wolong of Sichuan Province, according to panda expert Zhang Guiquan.

The eldest of the group, a pair of twin sisters, were more than 190 days old while the youngest, two non-identical twins, were delivered in late September.

Their first public appearance took place just ahead of the Lunar New Year, which is the most important annual festival in the Chinese culture and falls on February 12 this year.

To mark the occasion, keepers had adorned the event venue with time-honoured celebratory accessories, such as lanterns, decorative knots, couplets and posters.

Workers had also laid out plenty of playthings for the young pandas, including stuff toy oxen to represent the next Chinese animal symbol.

Amusing footage released by state newspaper People's Daily shows the cubs squirming in their keeper's arms as the carers sat down to send their new year's greetings to the public.

'Newborn baby pandas from the class of 2020 ... wish you a happy New Year and lots of good luck in the Year of the Ox,' the keepers shouted while some of the cubs tried to crawl away.

'Independently of the will of our local authorities to keep St Barts open, the French Government has just decided to put in place new preventive measures against Covid-19 variants,' said Nils Dafau, President of the Tourism Board, in a statement.

'St Barts authorities are right now negotiating with the French government to ease the entry restrictions and find an alternative solution. Our aim is to reopen the island's borders as soon as possible.'

The Caribbean island has recorded just 360 coronavirus cases and one death since the pandemic began. 'We have managed to keep it at bay, the situation is well managed and under control,' said Mr Dafau.

Those looking to travel to the area did not need to quarantine as long as they could provide proof of a negative coronavirus test result on arrival and show no symptoms, or take a test as soon as they land.

But now, their hopes of a break have been scuppered. France announced a ban on all non-essential travellers from outside the European Union on Sunday. Two days later, it also banned visitors to St Barts or any other French overseas territories including St Martin, Martinique and Guadeloupe.

France has reported among the world's highest virus death tolls, at 75,620, and more than 60 percent of its intensive care beds are occupied by virus patients.

Earlier in January, the day-to-day increase in coronavirus cases in the country was gradually declining after hitting a record high of nearly 18,000 on January 6. But the numbers did not drop enough and started to rise again last week.

Athletes are not required to get the Covid vaccination before flying out to the Olympics

Under the section entitled 'principles', the playbook says 'avoid physical contact, including hugs and handshakes' and 'support athletes by clapping and not singing or chanting'.

In theory, this means athletes cannot have sex in the Olympic Village — something which is usually rife — and they may not even be allowed to sing their national anthem on the podium, although that is unlikely to be enforced.

A decision on whether spectators can attend the Games will not be taken until the spring, but if crowds are allowed it is expected they too will be stopped from singing and shouting.

Athletes must be tested 72 hours before leaving for Japan, and then again on arrival

Athletes will be tested for Covid-19 every four days. Competitors and officials can only leave their accommodation to go to official venues and they cannot use public transport.

They 'must not visit Games venues as a spectator' and 'must not visit tourist areas, shops, restaurants or bars' — putting an end to post-event parties.

The playbook goes on to warn: 'Non-respect of the rules may have an impact on your participation to the Games, your access to Games venues and, in some cases, on your participation to competitions.

'Repeated or serious failures to comply with these rules may result in the withdrawal of your accreditation and right to participate in the Olympic and Paralympic Games.'

Covid-19 liaison officers will be appointed to ensure protocols are being followed and Christophe Dubi, the International Olympic Committee executive director, added: 'We do not anticipate many breaches of the rules but if there are, there will be a procedure in place.

'If push comes to shove and we have to activate the disciplinary commission, then this will be done. The rules are simple and are there for everyone to be safe.'

Attendees will be required to present proof of a negative Covid-19 test upon arrival in Japan for the rearranged Games, but they will not have to quarantine and vaccination is not mandatory.

They will have to download Japan's contact-tracing app and complete an 'activity plan' detailing all of their movements for their first 14 days in the country, including travel and accommodation plans.

Anyone who tests positive will have to isolate, possibly in a 'government-approved isolation facility'.

Organisers are adamant that the Games will go ahead this summer despite the continued spread of coronavirus and the state of emergency in Tokyo being extended for another month to March 7.

Dubi added: 'We each have our part to play. That's why these playbooks have been created — with the rules that will make each and every one of us a sound, safe and active contributor to the Games.

'We know these Olympic Games will be different in a number of ways. For all Games participants, there will be some conditions and constraints that will require flexibility and understanding.'

One dose of each may boost the immune response and better combat the changing strains, according to the funding body behind the Russia-made jab.

Trial results out yesterday show Sputnik is 92 per cent effective against Covid-19 after two jabs. Only 16 of 16,500 people given it had symptoms. No one died from the disease or needed hospital treatment.

Kirill Dmitriev, of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said combining it with the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab could help.

‘We generally believe that two shots of different vaccines –AstraZeneca and Sputnik – may actually work better because immunity gets stronger,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World At One.

‘This idea, called heterogeneous boosting, is at the core of the Sputnik vaccine because we use two different shots and believe this is the best way to fight with mutations, and this also fosters a partnership between different vaccine manufacturers.’

Asked whether the UK had contacted RDIF about acquiring some of the vaccine, Mr Dmitriev said: ‘Not yet, but I think once we have proven the efficacy of an AstraZeneca-Sputnik combination, I think it is possible to have this discussion with the UK.’

Russia became the first country to register a Covid vaccine for emergency use back in August, despite it only having been tested on a handful of people.

Scientists say the findings – published in The Lancet – show it has joined the ranks of Pfizer, Oxford, Moderna and Janssen as a proven effective vaccine.

The Russian vaccine, which works in the same way as the Oxford jab, was found to be 74 per cent effective at blocking Covid after just a single dose and worked for all ages. In a comment published with the paper, Professor Ian Jones, of the University of Reading, said: ‘The Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency.

‘But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19.’

2021-02-02 20:30:03+00:00,14,"At 75, Dolly Parton is eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19, but the country star says she isn't in a rush to get the inoculation.

The music icon, despite donating $1 million to vaccine development last year, says she wants to wait until 'more people get theirs' before she makes her appointment.

Speaking to AP, the singer, who lives in Tennessee, explained that she didn't want it to look like she was getting special preference because of her generous donation.

Ask if she'd received her shot, Parton said: 'No. I'm not going to get mine until some more people get theirs. I don't want it to look like I'm jumping the line just because I donated money. I'm very funny about that. I'm going to get mine though, but I'm going to wait.'

Waiting: Dolly Parton has revealed she hasn't yet got her COVID-19 shot despite donating $1 million to development of the vaccination

Parton found out in November that the funds she had donated to research had gone towards developing the Moderna vaccine. She found out with the rest of the nation after her name appeared among other sponsors in a preliminary report on the Moderna vaccine.

'I’m at the age where I could have gotten mine legally last week. I turned 75. I was going to do it on my birthday, and I thought, ""Nah, don’t do that."" You’ll look like you’re just doing a show. None of my work is really like that. I wasn’t doing it for a show.

Parton said she is fully committed to getting the shot and once she does, she'll talk about it in hopes it'll encourage people.

'I'm going to get mine. I want it. I'm going to get it. When I get it, I'll probably do it on camera so people will know and I’ll tell them the truth, if I have symptoms and all that.

'Hopefully it'll encourage people. I'm not going to jump the line just because I could.

'I don't want it to look like I'm jumping the line just because I donated money. I'm very funny about that. I'm going to get mine though, but I'm going to wait.' Parton told AP

As of Monday, 26 million people in the United States had received a first vaccine shot, and almost 6 million had the second, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Each state has its own set of priority groupings for the vaccine roll out. But last month the US health secretary urged states to open up eligibility to everyone 65 and older and to adults of any age with medical conditions that put them at high risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19.

Health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities were first on the list when the vaccine roll out began in December.

Asked what compelled her to donate to coronavirus research, Parton told AP: 'Well, I follow my heart. I'm a person of faith and I pray all the time that God will lead me into the right direction and let me know what to do.

'When the pandemic first hit, that was my first thought, ""I need to do something to try to help find a vaccination."" I just did some research with the people at Vanderbilt (University) — they're wonderful people, they've been so good through the years to my people in times of illness and all that. I just asked if I could donate a million dollars to the research for a vaccine.

'When the pandemic first hit, that was my first thought, ""I need to do something to try to help find a vaccination.""' Parton said about donating to Vanderbilt University for coronavirus research

'I get a lot more credit than I deserve I think, but I was just happy to be a part of any and all of that.'

Parton said she plans to be around for a long time yet and she isn't letting her advancing age slow her down.

'I plan to be around a lot longer. I don’t have no plans of slowing down because the number says I should. I don’t pay attention to that. I wake up with new dreams every day.

'I try to make the most of every year that I’ve lived. I’ve been doing that since I was little. I’ll be doing it until I keel over. Hopefully that won’t be anytime soon.'

Meanwhile, Parton has revealed she turned down two opportunities to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Donald Trump.

The music icon made the admission during an interview with the Today show on Monday - but clarified that her decision to reject the nation's highest civilian honor had nothing to do with her politics.

'I couldn't accept it because my husband was ill and then they asked me again about it and I wouldn't travel because of the COVID,' Parton explained.

Parton also told the program that Joe Biden's administration recently approached her with an offer to award her with the Medal of Freedom, but she has not yet accepted.

'Now I feel like if I take it, I'll be doing politics, so I'm not sure,' she admitted.

During her glittering 60 year career, Parton has stayed away from expressing her political opinions and, as such, is a beloved figure on both the left and the right.

Parton instead focuses on philanthropy, but insists she never got into charity work to receive adulation.

'I don't work for those awards. It'd be nice [to receive the Medal of Freedom] but I'm not sure that I even deserve it. But it's a nice compliment for people to think that I might deserve it.'

Back in 1988, following the creation of the Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Parton launched the Dollywood Foundation.

The non-profit organization first started out as a means of awarding scholarships to high school students, but has since evolved into much more.

Most notably, the Dollywood Foundation gave birth to Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, which is 'a book gifting program which mails high-quality, free books to more than a million children around the world each month.'

According to Today, Dolly Parton's Imagination Library has 'donated '100 million children's books in the past 26 years.'

On two occasions, Parton turned down an offer to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Trump. Parton says she is now not sure whether she could accept the honor from Joe Biden for fear of looking like a political partisan

In addition to her charity work, Parton has become one of America's most beloved cultural icons. The country music star has released 51 studio albums which have sold a whopping 100 million copies worldwide.

During an appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last year, the 59-year-old politician said he was 'shocked' to learn that Dolly had yet to receive the honor, calling it 'a mistake.'

'Actually, that was a screwup, I'm surprised. I think I assumed that she'd already got one and that was incorrect. I'm surprised, she deserves one,' he continued.

2021-02-02 13:39:40+00:00,41,"The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine will not be recommended for over-65s in France or Sweden, the countries' health ministries announced today.

It comes after Germany advised against administering the jab to those over 65 and Emmanuel Macron claimed it was 'almost ineffective' for the age bracket.

Continental objections to the jab last week came amid a furious row between the Bloc and AstraZeneca over lagging supply, which has seen newly-unshackled Brexit Britain storm ahead in its immunisation roll-out.

Stockholm and Paris today agreed with Berlin that there was not enough data to show how the vaccine affects elderly patients.

Boris Johnson and UK health chiefs have insisted that the jab, made by Swedish-British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, is effective for all age groups.

But pouring petrol on the row again today, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen accused Britain of compromising on safety by giving swift approval to the jab.

Sweden, with a population of 10 million, registered 224 new deaths Tuesday, taking the total to 11,815. The deaths registered have occurred over several days and sometimes weeks.

Sweden, which has shunned lockdowns throughout the pandemic, registered 9,649 new coronavirus cases since Friday, Health Agency statistics showed on Tuesday. The figure compares to 9,123 cases in the corresponding period last week. New cases and hospitalisations have come down significantly in recent weeks.

The former German defence minister also took the chance to throw her deputy leader under the bus over the EU vaccine shambles.

Brussels last week descended into bitter attacks on Britain and AstraZeneca, which it accused of reneging on it contractual obligations to deliver the jab, with suspicions raised that the company had supplied the UK with the EU's doses.

EU Vaccine approval: State of play Approved for the EU BioNTech/Pfizer (German/US, mRNA vaccine, 95-percent efficacy according the European Medicines Agency): 600 million doses. Its first-quarter deliveries to EU member states were cut by as much as half, but the company vows they will be back to normal by mid-February. Moderna: (US, mRNA vaccine, 94-percent efficacy): 160 million doses. AstraZeneca (Anglo-Swedish, adenovirus, 60-percent efficacy): 400 million doses. It was meant to have delivered more than 100 million doses in the first quarter, but on December 22 said that would be cut to 31 million. Von der Leyen announced on Sunday that would now be boosted to 40 million. Pending approval Johnson & Johnson (US, adenovirus, efficacy unknown): 400 million doses. The Commission says 100 million should be delivered by June if this single-shot vaccine is approved. CureVac (Germany/US, mRNA, efficacy unknown): 405 million doses. Sanofi/GSK (France/UK, recombinant spike protein, efficacy unknown): 300 million doses. After a disappointing Phase 2 trial, the companies are trying a different antigen formulation and are now aiming for production late this year. The Commission is also in exploratory talks with Novavax (US, recombinant spike protein, efficacy unknown) for up to 200 million doses and with Valneva (French, inactivated virus vaccine, efficacy unknown) for up to 60 million doses.

Mr Johnson said on Friday that the vaccine 'is very good and efficacious' after health officials in Berlin warned that there was 'insufficient data to assess the efficacy of the vaccine for persons aged 65 years and older.'

AstraZeneca has been open about their initial tests in which only 10 per cent of the participants were 65 or older.

However, there are trials ongoing throughout the world to prove its efficacy further in the older age groups.

Amid EU rancour last Friday, the European Medicines Agency, the Bloc's regulator, granted approval to the AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups.

The British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the jab in December, well before its European counterparts.

As a result of the fast approval and Britain's investment in its vaccine programme, the UK - which finally quit the EU on January 1 - has taken the lead in the roll-out stakes.

As of Sunday, Britain had dished out 14.42 jabs per 100 people, while Germany has only managed 2.95 and France 2.35.

The UK committed £1.67 billion to ordering doses, while the EU spent only £1.57 billion for its 27 member states.

That works out to £25.00 per capita for Britain, compared to £3.51 for Europe.

Germany's medicines regulator, STIKO, did not reveal the specific data used to come to their conclusion about not recommending the jab for over-65s.

But last week as the jab war raged between London and Brussels, two prominent German media outlets claimed the efficacy for over-65s was below 10 per cent.

The reports were firmly rejected by AstraZeneca as well as by the German health ministry.

'A false claim does not become true just because it is repeated,' a German health ministry spokesman said of the reports.

He noted that it is a known fact that the AstraZeneca trials involved fewer older people than other manufacturers'.

But 'that the efficacy is only eight percent is incomprehensible and in our view, wrong,' he added.

STIKO said that apart from the 'limitation' in data on older people, the vaccine was 'considered appropriate' for 18 to 64-year-olds.

The UK committed £1.67billion on Covid vaccines before it was known whether they would be effective - more than the £1.57billion the EU put forward for its 448million people, with Britain spending £25.00 per capita compared to £3.51 for Brussels. The US government spent £7.9billion in total, according to the figures from science analytics firm Airfinity, an outlay of £24.02 for each of its 330million people

EU country's vaccination programmes have been lagging behind other nations as the bloc continues to struggle with its rollout following the fiasco

British regulators had said that 660 older people took part in the Oxford AstraZeneca trials, acknowledging that there were too few to derive an efficacy figure for that specific group.

The trials showed one out of 341 older vaccine recipients testing positive for Covid-19, compared to one out of 319 who received a dummy jab - making a senior-specific comparison almost pointless.

But the vaccine did generate antibodies in all the over-65s who received two doses of the jab, which AstraZeneca cited as evidence that they had 'strong immune responses to the vaccine'.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said that older people had not been vaccinated until later in the trial because 'very ethical' Oxford scientists wanted to confirm there would be no negative side-effects.

'They're very ethical, and very academic. So they didn't want to vaccinate older people until they had accumulated a lot of safety data in the 18 to 55 group,' he said.

'They said it was not ethical to vaccinate old people until they had enough safety data in younger people.

'Other companies took this risk, went ahead and vaccinated older people faster or earlier. If you start earlier, you have more data. Essentially, because Oxford started vaccinating older people later, we don't have a huge number of older people who have been vaccinated.'

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, pictured in Brussels on Sunday, has come under pressure over the EU's slow jab rollout and her attempt to control vaccine exports

But Mrs Von der Leyen reignited the row today as she accused Britain of compromising on the safety of its citizens.

How did the UK end up as one of the world's leading countries on the vaccine roll-out? The UK is one of the world's leading countries when it comes to the speed of the roll-out of its coronavirus vaccination programme - a fact made all the more impressive given where the nation started when the pandemic hit early last year. At that point the country had just one vaccine manufacturing site - a facility in Liverpool which made flu jabs. But the Government quickly set up a vaccine task force in April to make sure the UK was well-positioned to benefit from medical breakthroughs. The experts appointed to the task force reportedly recommended seven projects for investment within its first two weeks, according to The Times. Advance purchase orders were hammered out by the task force with suppliers despite the fact there were no guarantees that any of the vaccines would work or that they would be signed off by regulators. That early work meant the UK was in pole position to receive the jabs, if and when they were shown to be effective and safe. The task force's strategy means two companies have been relied upon to do much of the heavy lifting during the UK's vaccine roll-out: Pfizer and AstraZeneca. The UK ordered 40 million doses from the former and 100 million doses from the latter. Agreements are also in place with a handful of other would-be suppliers should their products get the green light. The speed with which the UK moved on vaccines was perhaps best illustrated this week when Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, revealed the deal with Britain was agreed three months before the EU's. The UK's supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine is made at sites in Oxford and Staffordshire before it is put into vials at a facility in Wrexham, while the Pfizer jab is made in Belgium. Every new batch of vaccine in the UK has to be safety tested by the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control in Hertfordshire before it can be sent for delivery. This process takes about four days and once each batch has been rubber-stamped it is taken to secure Government warehouses where the NHS takes over the process and decides where the doses will be sent. The physical roll-out of the vaccine is headquartered from an NHS office in London, with doses sent to more than 1,400 vaccine sites across the country. It is easily the biggest vaccination drive in the history of the health service and many believe it will become an annual programme. Advertisement

Her comments came after she pinned the blame for the vaccine supply shambles -that saw Brussels threaten Britain with a vaccine export ban - on her deputy Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commissioner for Trade.

The under-fire European commission president said she was committed to her role, and that she should be judged at the end of her term in 2024.

She also refused to apologise for the coronavirus vaccines row last week that saw Brussels threaten to introduce a hard Irish border to block vaccine exports to the UK.

But pressure is mounting on the former German defence minister, particularly from her home country, where German MPs are planning to call her in for questioning over her handling of the EU's slow vaccination programme.

Speaking on Monday, Mrs von der Leyen defended the EU's slower vaccine approvals policy, while criticising Britain's for compromising on 'safety and efficacy'.

'Some countries started to vaccinate a little before Europe, it is true,' she said in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde when asked about Britain.

'But they resorted to emergency, 24-hour marketing authorisation procedures. The commission and the member states agreed not to compromise with the safety and efficacy requirements linked to the authorisation of a vaccine,' she said.

'Time had to be taken to analyse the data, which, even minimised, takes three to four weeks. So, yes, Europe left it later, but it was the right decision. I remind you that a vaccine is the injection of an active biological substance into a healthy body. We are talking about mass vaccination here, it is a gigantic responsibility.'

Through her spokesman, Mrs von der Leyen also threw her deputy leader under the bus over the EU vaccine shambles, that saw Brussels decide to trigger Article 16 before performing a later U-turn.

Brussels accused pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca of breaching its contract with the EU, amid suspicion that the company had supplied the UK with stock that was meant to go to countries in the bloc.

Britain used emergency procedures to grant market approval to the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, and signed a contract three months earlier than the EU, which used a slower approval process.

Mrs von der Leyen said she did not take personal responsibility for the decision to trigger Article 16 of the Brexit treaty, which would have seen a hard 'vaccine border' in Ireland to stop vaccines from being smuggled through a back door, but she did admit the decision was an error.

Instead, the European commission president said that the responsibility lay with Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commissioner for Trade.

'This regulation falls under the responsibility of Mr Dombrovskis,' Eric Mamer, the European Commission's chief spokesman, said on Monday of the former prime minister of Latvia.

'In my country we have a saying, 'Only the Pope is infallible,'' Mr Mamer said.

'Mistakes can happen along the way the important thing is that you recognise them early on.'

Speaking herself during the newspaper interview, Mrs von der Leyen said: 'I know how sensitive the Irish subject is. But when you take urgent decisions - in this year of crisis, the Commission has taken almost 900 - there is always a risk of missing something. I am relieved that we were able to find a solution.'

The legislation was met with a fierce backlash, and was amended after Mr Johnson and the Irish prime minister Micheál Martin called Mrs von der Leyen.

France's president Emmanuel Macron (pictured Thursday) has astonishingly claimed the AstraZeneca vaccine is 'almost ineffective' on people who are over 65 years of age

After years of Brexit negotiations between Britain and the EU to avoid a hard border on the island, the move would have created a 'vaccine border'.

It was announced without notifying either Ireland or Britain.

Von der Leyen's initial comments attempting to avoid blame were met with scathing criticism from Alexander Stubb, the former prime minister of Finland, who campaigned to be appointed European Commission president himself.

'Number one rule of any leader: if your organisation screws up; never, ever blame your team publicly,' he said in response.

To add to her woes, von der Leyen's predecessor Jean-Claude Juncker said he was 'very much opposed' to her export restriction measures during a speech in Stuttgart on Sunday.

The Brussels-imposed export controls were introduced last week to supervise vaccines leaving the bloc for other countries, after AstraZeneca said it was cutting supplies to the EU in the first quarter of 2021.

'It all went too slow, it all should have been done more transparently, even though that would have been difficult,' Juncker said.

Mr Mamer said the regulation to create an 'export transparency mechanism', which included the Article 16 measure, was passed provisionally and hurriedly by the College of Commissioners on Friday.

'We believe that we are on the right track since the beginning of this pandemic in ensuring there is as cohesive and as effective a European response as possible,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

But Mrs Von der Leyen attempt to pass the blame on to her deputy has led to suggestions from EU diplomats that she has gone rogue, and to German MPs in Berlin planning to summon her in for questioning.

To make matters worse for her, the move by German MPs was led by legislators from her own party, Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).

The European Commission president pinned the fiasco - that saw Brussels threaten to implement a hard Irish border - on Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commissioner for Trade (pictured in Brussels on January 29)

Thus far, Mrs von der Leyen has refused calls for a public debate on the fiasco in the European Parliament, and she will instead hold closed-door meetings with MEPs on Tuesday with parties who approved her appointment.

In an interview on German television, she denied that the EU was losing a vaccine race against Britain, insisting that the only race was against the virus and time.

She also gave an assurance that neither the EU or Britain would block each other's vaccine supplies.

The EU and many of its 27 members have faced criticism over their sluggish rollout, with fewer than 10million people getting a dose so far across the entire bloc.

Von der Leyen's European Commission has invested 2.7 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to secure 2.3 billion doses from companies making potential vaccines, mostly using European factories.

Three vaccines are so far authorised for use across the EU's 27 member countries: one by German outfit BioNTech with US giant Pfizer; one by US company Moderna; and most recently one by Anglo-Swedish group AstraZeneca.

All three firms are undershooting on delivery schedules for the January-March first-quarter period.

While excessive bureaucracy in countries such as France and Germany has been one reason for the slow start, the EU has also struggled to get hold of enough supplies.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday defended the European Union's troubled vaccine drive, saying there were 'good reasons' the rollout had got off to a slower start than in some other countries.

Speaking after a vaccine 'summit' that brought together key players, Merkel renewed a promise to offer every German citizen a vaccine by the end of September.

Merkel had convened the online talks in response to growing anger in the 27-member bloc over the sluggish rollout of Covid-19 jabs, which has been beset with delivery delays and piled political pressure on EU leaders.

'It is true that in some areas, the pace became slower, but there were good reasons for it to be slower,' Merkel told reporters in Berlin.

Merkel, the leader of Europe's largest economy, acknowledged that the United States, Israel and Britain were further along with their inoculations.

But she said the EU had deliberately avoided rushed emergency approvals, as seen in the UK, to bolster public 'confidence' in the jabs.

The EU had also at times negotiated 'for a very long time' to ensure pharma companies took on enough liability, she said.

And the bloc chose not to sacrifice data protection, Merkel added, in a nod to Israel's deal with Pfizer/BioNTech to offer data on its inoculation campaign in exchange for doses.

German media has been scathing about the EU's troubled vaccine drive, with the topselling Bild daily calling it a 'disaster'.

Mrs Von der Leyen did not join Merkel's meeting with top German politicians, but the EU commissioners for health and the internal market did.

A string of vaccine makers also took part, including Pfizer, BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and CureVac.

'The months ahead will be challenging. We must all continue working together in solidarity to find solutions,' said Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides.

Like other EU leaders, Merkel has come under fire for the decision to pursue an EU-wide rather than a national strategy on inoculations.

She has said a go-it-alone drive would have inflated prices, left pockets of the continent more vulnerable to the pandemic and poisoned political unity in the bloc.

The German debate has been supercharged by the start of a general election year to choose a successor to Merkel, who has led the country since 2005.

The Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Merkel's loveless 'grand coalition' government, at the weekend demanded she produce a 'roadmap' toward the September vaccinations goal.

Pfizer and BioNTech have slowed down production to make manufacturing changes, while AstraZeneca said it was cutting supplies to the EU in the first quarter of 2021.

That prompted outrage from Brussels, which imposed export controls last week to supervise vaccines leaving the bloc for other countries.

Pharmaceutical companies have since made public pledges to make up for the shortfalls with additional doses later on - though none has pledged to speed up the initial delivery, meaning the EU's Covid pain will drag on for some time.

BioNTech and Pfizer have promised to send up to 75 million extra doses to the bloc in the spring thanks to progress at key manufacturing sites.

Meanwhile Mrs von der Leyen, who signed the vaccine contracts on behalf of the bloc, said Sunday that AstraZeneca would deliver 40 million doses in total in the first quarter - 30 per cent more previously promised - but shipments will not start until the second week of February.

And chemicals giant Bayer announced that from 2022 it would produce a coronavirus vaccine that fellow German pharmaceuticals company CureVac is developing.

CureVac CEO Franz-Werner Haas said his company would also produce several hundred million doses of its own vaccine by the end of 2021.

CureVac's mRNA vaccine has yet to receive the green light from regulators, but German health minister Jens Spahn said it was 'on its way to approval in the coming weeks'.

French pharma group Sanofi agreed last week to help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

A European source said on Monday that Germany was putting 'tremendous' pressure on the Commission to improve the vaccine rollout, adding that von der Leyen's position had been 'severely weakened'.

The Brussels-imposed export controls were introduced last week to supervise vaccines leaving the bloc for other countries, after AstraZeneca said it was cutting supplies to the EU in the first quarter of 2021. Pictured: health worker draws a dose of the AstraZeneca's coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine in Newcastle upon Tyne, Britain, January 30

While Brussels boasts of having a portfolio of 2.3billion doses, it has paid dearly for failing to sign its agreement with AstraZeneca until August last year.

Meanwhile, the EU's contract with Pfizer was not signed until November 2020, two days after the company had announced its successful trial results.

The Pfizer rollout did not begin until the very end of December, and even a month later the daily vaccination rates in countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain are well below those in Britain and the US.

Brussels did sign a deal with Moderna days before Britain, but again this was after the jab had already passed clinical trials.

And the EU was again shown to be lagging when the Novavax trial results were published last week showing 89.3 per cent efficacy.

While Britain has 60million doses ordered, the EU has only conducted 'exploratory talks' with the manufacturer, which were completed in December.

Even then, the 200million doses envisaged in an 'exploratory contract' are a smaller stockpile when adjusted for population size than Britain has ordered.

The EU also has other agreements in place with vaccines from Sanofi-GSK and CureVac, which have yet to conclude clinical trials.

Each EU member state is responsible for its own rollout. Most are giving priority to the elderly and frontline health workers.

Almost all the vaccines require two jabs for a full vaccination. (Johnson & Johnson is aiming for a single-shot regimen, subject to trials and EMA approval.)

Collectively, the European Union as of Saturday had provided 2.4 doses per 100 people, according to official sources collated by the website Our World in Data.

Top performers are Malta (6.08 doses per 100 people), Denmark (4.47), Slovenia (3.65) and Romania (3.50).

The bigger countries are trailing: Germany has given 2.8 doses per 100 people, France 2.34, Italy 3.16 and Spain 3.1.

The countries leading the world in giving jabs are Israel (54.7 per 100 people, with most of those over 70 already having been vaccinated with their two injections), the United Arab Emirates (33.7) and Britain (13.9).

Britain, which left the EU last year, is focused on giving the maximum number of people one injection and stretching out the time before they become completely vaccinated through their second injection.

France and other EU countries, in contrast, say they are maintaining stocks to give the second jab as recommended, even if that means a slowdown in their first jab programme.

Some EU countries, particularly in the poorer east of the bloc, are sensitive to the cost of vaccinating their populations. The logistical challenge of the mRNA-type vaccines that require sub-Arctic temperatures is also a factor.

While the price of each vaccine has been kept secret in the European Commission's contracts, a Belgian minister's tweet in December - deleted afterwards - gave a breakdown.

The Moderna vaccine was listed as most expensive, with Brussels paying 14.70 euros a dose. The BioNTech/Pfizer one 12 euros. The AstraZeneca vaccine came in at 1.78 euros a dose.",MailOnline,"['von', 'eu', 'britain', 'recommended', 'doses', 'france', 'vaccine', 'million', 'astrazeneca', 'sweden', 'covid19', 'der', 'over65s', 'german', 'european']",0

Some 200 people gathered in central Brasilia, holding signs and banners saying 'Bolsonaro Out' and 'Impeachment Now,' while scores of autos drove slowly by, honking their horns in support.

The protests, like larger ones last weekend, were organized by leftist parties and groups.

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said Saturday that it was not the government's responsibility to provide oxygen to the health system in the northwestern state of Amazonas, where medical facilities have been forced to transfer more than 300 coronavirus patients to hospitals in other states. At least 14 patients who were hospitalized in centers that lacked sufficient oxygen died in January, including 11 after they were transferred to other facilities Saturday

Anti-Bolsonaro protests also took place in Sao Pãulo and Rio de Janeiro.

The coronavirus pandemic as of Monday has claimed 224,504 lives in Brazil, second only to the United States, where more than 440,000 have died.

The ravaging virus has generated 9,204,731 confirmed cases in the South American nation.

The demonstrations picked up steam as Bolsonaro declared Saturday that it was not the government's responsibility to provide oxygen to northwestern state of Amazonas, where medical facilities are at capacity and struggling to provide treatment to COVID patients.

'It is not our competence and we are not responsible for taking oxygen there,' Bolsonaro said.

Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly played down the gravity of the pandemic, calling it a 'little flu' and minimizing the importance of mask-wearing and social distancing, argued that the federal government had provided the Amazonas state government financial support to address the dire condition of its crippling health system.

Despite receiving the full support from Bolsonaro, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello learned last week that the Brazilian Supreme Court approved an investigation into his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas.

According to Bolsonaro, Pazuello was six days late in learning of the problems that medical institutions were facing before a delivery of oxygen tanks was signed off.

One group stood Sunday before the National Congress building, wearing plastic bags over their heads to symbolize at least 14 Covid-19 patients in Amazonas who died after hospitals ran out of oxygen - a problem also seen in neighboring Para and Roraima states.

The lack of sufficient oxygen in hospitals throughout Amazonas began in mid-January. The crisis forced doctors to transfer 335 patients to other medical facilities in nearby states on Saturday. However, 11 patients who were battling the virus died in the process.

Russia said Monday that its economy contracted by 3.1 percent in 2020 as the oil producing nation was hit by coronavirus lockdowns and a plunge in global crude prices.

The drop was less severe than Russian authorities had expected however, as the central bank had forecast a contraction of about 4.0 percent.

The Rosstat statistics agency attributed the drop to 'restrictions imposed to combat the coronavirus and the fall in global demand for energy resources'.

The 3.1 percent drop, a first estimate, was also a relatively good result compared with many European countries that reintroduced lockdowns when a second wave of infections surged late last year.

Spain saw an 11 percent drop, France 8.3 percent and Germany 5.0 percent.

Russian authorities imposed a six-week lockdown in the spring.

In the video interview, Ellen said that while she just got over COVID herself, Rita and husband Tom Hanks, also 64, got it 'early on.'

When asked if they were getting calls for advice, she said: 'Well yeah and you kind of feel super hero-like and superhuman because you have the antibodies and you feel like you can go places and do things except nobody else can go anywhere and do anything.'

But yes, we got a lot of calls and it was actually really lovely to hear from people. And I know we talked when you had it. And it's horrible to have it. Hopefully now the vaccine's going to be out there and people can get it, and we can get back to normal life soon.'

Ellen noted that when you have the virus, 'people are scared of you and they run away.'

Rita said that when she and Tom had it, 'we were so early on in getting it that we were completely isolated and we didn't see anybody. It was just us. And sometimes he scared me, so I did run away,' she joked.

Ellen asked if she has been tested recently for antibodies, which Rita said she was, and that in fact does not have any more.

Rita said: 'Sadly, I don't have the antibodies anymore. I just tested two weeks ago, and I don't have the antibodies anymore but it's OK, I have a mask. And I have hand sanitizer so I'm back like everyone else.'

Rita and Tom both contracted and then recovered from COVID-19 in March while they were in Australia for work; they were told at the time they have gotten the disease while in the US or in transit to Australia - not in Australia.

On December 31, 2019, after four cases of a mystery pneumonia were linked to the market, it was shuttered overnight. By the end of January, Wuhan had gone into a 76-day lockdown.

Experts say the Huanan market still plays a role in tracing the origins of the virus, since the first cluster of cases was identified there.

Following a two-week quarantine in the city that ended on Thursday, the WHO team is expected to visit laboratories, markets and hospitals in Wuhan.

The WHO-led probe in Wuhan has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.

The team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being 'China-centric'.

On Saturday, the WHO team was given a tour of an exhibition that celebrates China's response to the pandemic.

The trip came after WHO experts went to a hospital in Wuhan where some of the earliest coronavirus patients were treated and took place a day after they had their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese scientists.

2021-01-29 18:07:54+00:00,22,"Covid-19 could have a long-term effect on male fertility, a study in Germany has claimed.

Scientists compared semen quality in groups of men who had recovered from the virus to those who had never contracted it.

They found that having had Covid-19 appeared to lead to 'lower sperm quality and reduced fertility potential'.

The sperm were more likely to be deformed, the researchers found, to be less mobile and to be found in lower concentrations in the semen, which could make it more difficult to conceive.

Effects of Covid on people's ability to have children has not been widely studied because the disease has more devastating effects on the lungs, heart and blood vessels which have required more urgent scientific attention.

It was not exactly clear how coronavirus affected the testicles, the scientists said, although fever - a common symptom of Covid - is known to be able to damage them.

The damage to sperm quality appeared to reduce after time, with it returning towards normal levels as more time elapsed after infection, but the effects were worse in men who had been more severely ill.

Following the study, researchers advised men who survived Covid to have their reproductive health checked before trying for a baby - but warned their findings were not concrete.

Scientists in Germany found Covid-19 effected the shape, concentration and mobility of sperm, but experts say more research needs to be done - as even the common flu can have an impact on sperm count (stock image)

Experts at Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, analysed 84 men with Covid- 19 and 105 age-matched control subjects, without the virus, taking measurements every 10 days for 60 days.

The study found a significant deterioration in semen quality up to 60 days after the illness.

When they compared the two groups they found that indicators that could make a men less able to father a child were significantly more common among men who had had Covid.

COVID 'COULD TRIGGER LOW TESTOSTERONE' The coronavirus saps men's testosterone and leaves them more susceptible to falling seriously ill as well as robbing them of their sex drive, a study suggests. Researchers in Turkey analysed levels of the sex hormone in 200 men who were in hospital after they tested positive for Covid-19. More than half (51 per cent) had developed a condition called hypogonadism, in which their bodies did not produce enough testosterone. On average, participants' levels were drained by 30 per cent post-infection to borderline unhealthy levels. Academics claimed there was a direct correlation between severe illness and lower testosterone levels. But, even among men who showed no symptoms of the virus at all, two thirds reported having a lowered sex drive – a tell-tale sign of low testosterone. As well as being key in the development of sex organs and muscle growth, testosterone also helps regulate the immune responses, including fighting viral infections. Low levels have been linked to an increased risk of dying from the flu, as well as inflammation, heart disease and high blood pressure. University of Mersin scientists, behind the study, believe Covid-19 makes men more vulnerable to its nastier symptoms by hampering their immune systems. Lead author Professor Selahittin Çayan, a urologist at the university, said: 'In our study, the mean total testosterone decreased, as the severity of the Covid-19 increased.' The study was published in the journal The Aging Male. Advertisement

These included signs of swelling, sperm cell death and oxidative stress, which is when volatile chemicals build up in living tissues because of cells not working properly.

The concentration of sperm was reduced by up to 516 per cent and its mobility dropped by 209 per cent, the study said, although all the men were still confirmed to be fertile.

The reduction in mobility and concentration of sperm, as well as a significant altering of their shape which is critical to their ability to move through the cervix and uterus, led to a state called OAT.

OAT is known scientifically as oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and is a common cause of low fertility among men.

The lead researcher on the study, PhD student Behzad Hajizadeh Maleki said: 'These effects on sperm cells are associated with lower sperm quality and reduced fertility potential.

'Although these effects tended to improve over time, they remained significantly and abnormally higher in the Covid-19 patients, and the magnitude of these changes were also related to disease severity.'

Although the Giessen team's findings seem worrying, other scientists say they want more research and longer term evidence to be convinced about Covid's real effects on fertility.

Male fertility is known to be affected by fevers because the testicles cannot function as well at high internal temperatures.

Fever is one of the most common symptoms of the coronavirus so this link could account for some of the damage seen in the team's study. Often the damage is reversible and reduces over time.

Professor Alison Murdoch, a fertility expert at Newcastle University, said: 'It is well documented that adverse changes are frequently seen after systemic illness with recovery typically taking at least 3 months.

'As the authors acknowledge, their findings may be such a nonspecific response. Thus, longer term studies are needed before the testes is considered to be a high-risk organ specific to Covid-19.

'It is important to note that there is no evidence of Covid-19 virus in the semen and that there is no evidence that virus can be transmitted via semen.'

Professor Allan Pacey, an expert in andrology at the University of Sheffield, also urged caution over the findings, saying: 'Since sperm production takes just under three months, roughly, to be completed from start to finish, in my opinion they ended the study 30 days too soon.'

Another study found last year that Covid-19 may be able to deplete testosterone stores in the body, which could be expected to have an impact on male fertility, which is controlled by the sex hormone.

Researchers in Turkey analysed levels of the sex hormone in 200 men who were in hospital after they tested positive for Covid-19.

More than half (51 per cent) had developed a condition called hypogonadism, in which their bodies did not produce enough testosterone. On average, participants' levels were drained by 30 per cent post-infection to borderline unhealthy levels.

2021-01-29 16:52:52+00:00,12,"Mexico has surpassed India as the country with the world's third-highest death toll after nearly a year of the country's president downplaying the virus - which he contracted himself earlier this month.

And data researchers say the death figures could actually be much higher because of the country's low rate of testing.

Mexico logged 155,145 confirmed deaths as of Thursday, according to data from John Hopkins University.

Those figures move the country past India, which had a death toll of 153,847, after it reported 1,506 newly confirmed deaths Thursday.

Despite the record death numbers, health experts believe the real toll to date is well over 195,000 due to Mexico's extreme low rate of testing. The country also recorded 18,670 newly confirmed infections, bringing the total to 1,825,519 million.

The United States has the highest death toll with 433,233 deaths and Brazil is second with 221,547.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who throughout the pandemic refused to wear a face mask as a preventive measure against the spread of the deadly virus, tested positive for COVID-19 last Sunday after getting off a commercial flight. He continues to receive treatment at his apartment in the National Palace in Mexico City.

According a study published Thursday by a nonprofit think tank, the Lowy Institute, Mexico's response to the epidemic is the second-worst in the globe, placing 97 among 98 countries.

Mexico has the second-worst response to the Covid pandemic in the world, according to a study released by the Lowry Institute

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who on Sunday tested positive for COVID-19, had a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday and announced Mexico will soon receive 24 million doses of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine. The 61-year-old was diagnosed with light symptoms and is receiving medication as he continues to serve in his normal capacity while quarantining at the National Palace

The research discovered that structural factors such as an advanced economy or political system did not give countries an advantage.

'The results basically show that neither democracies nor authoritarian states did better than the other,' Lowy Institute researcher Alyssa Leng said, according to The Australian.

The Lowy Institute found a lot of 'quiet achievers' outperformed in their pandemic management. Countries with a population of less than 10million generally came out on top, the data suggests.

'In general, countries with smaller populations, cohesive societies and capable institutions have a comparative advantage in dealing with a global crisis such as a pandemic,' Leng said.

Meanwhile, Mexico became the first country in Latin America to roll out the vaccine, doing so December 24, 2020, when it started vaccinating front line health workers with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine.

It so far has managed to get only about 760,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines, and is placing its hopes on Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. López Obrador spoke to President Vladimir Putin to announce the shipment of 24 million doses of the vaccine.

However, Russia has not yet publicly presented the results of Phase 3 testing, which would yield data on how effective it is.

Nevertheless, Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell said earlier this week that Mexico is close to approving the Sputnik vaccine, based on confidential documents he was allowed to see by Argentina, where the shot is already being administered.

That has caused a storm of criticism in Mexico, with some saying the vaccine shouldn't be approved or used until that data is released.

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been proven to be 94.1% effective against the virus while the Pfizer vaccine has an effectiveness of 95%.

López-Gatell responded by claiming the critics were anti-vaccine, and accused them of doing 'a lot of damage.'

'They have started to discredit vaccines in a completely irrational manner, with no evidence,' López-Gatell said.

But critics say López-Gatell is the one with a lack of evidence.

'They have made up the idea that I am anti-vaccine, because I caught them,' wrote Senator Lilly Téllez of the conservative opposition National Action Party. 'I do want vaccines, but ones that have been approved by the World Health Organization and the international scientific community.'",MailOnline,"['tops', '155000', 'worlds', 'death', 'president', 'mexico', 'deaths', 'vaccine', 'rank', 'obrador', 'confirmed', 'covid19', 'country', 'coronavirus', 'thirdworst', 'toll']",0

2021-01-29 11:39:06+00:00,29,"Covid-19 could have a long-term effect on male fertility, a study in Germany has claimed.

Scientists compared semen quality in groups of men who had recovered from the virus to those who had never contracted it.

They found that having had Covid-19 appeared to lead to 'lower sperm quality and reduced fertility potential'.

The sperm were more likely to be deformed, the researchers found, to be less mobile and to be found in lower concentrations in the semen, which could make it more difficult to conceive.

Effects of Covid on people's ability to have children has not been widely studied because the disease has more devastating effects on the lungs, heart and blood vessels which have required more urgent scientific attention.

It was not exactly clear how coronavirus affected the testicles, the scientists said, although fever - a common symptom of Covid - is known to be able to damage them.

The damage to sperm quality appeared to reduce after time, with it returning towards normal levels as more time elapsed after infection, but the effects were worse in men who had been more severely ill.

Following the study, researchers advised men who survived Covid to have their reproductive health checked before trying for a baby - but warned their findings were not concrete.

Scientists in Germany found Covid-19 effected the shape, concentration and mobility of sperm, but experts say more research needs to be done - as even the common flu can have an impact on sperm count (stock image)

Experts at Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, analysed 84 men with Covid- 19 and 105 age-matched control subjects, without the virus, taking measurements every 10 days for 60 days.

The study found a significant deterioration in semen quality up to 60 days after the illness.

When they compared the two groups they found that indicators that could make a men less able to father a child were significantly more common among men who had had Covid.

COVID 'COULD TRIGGER LOW TESTOSTERONE' The coronavirus saps men's testosterone and leaves them more susceptible to falling seriously ill as well as robbing them of their sex drive, a study suggests. Researchers in Turkey analysed levels of the sex hormone in 200 men who were in hospital after they tested positive for Covid-19. More than half (51 per cent) had developed a condition called hypogonadism, in which their bodies did not produce enough testosterone. On average, participants' levels were drained by 30 per cent post-infection to borderline unhealthy levels. Academics claimed there was a direct correlation between severe illness and lower testosterone levels. But, even among men who showed no symptoms of the virus at all, two thirds reported having a lowered sex drive – a tell-tale sign of low testosterone. As well as being key in the development of sex organs and muscle growth, testosterone also helps regulate the immune responses, including fighting viral infections. Low levels have been linked to an increased risk of dying from the flu, as well as inflammation, heart disease and high blood pressure. University of Mersin scientists, behind the study, believe Covid-19 makes men more vulnerable to its nastier symptoms by hampering their immune systems. Lead author Professor Selahittin Çayan, a urologist at the university, said: 'In our study, the mean total testosterone decreased, as the severity of the Covid-19 increased.' The study was published in the journal The Aging Male. Advertisement

These included signs of swelling, sperm cell death and oxidative stress, which is when volatile chemicals build up in living tissues because of cells not working properly.

The concentration of sperm was reduced by up to 516 per cent and its mobility dropped by 209 per cent, the study said, although all the men were still confirmed to be fertile.

The reduction in mobility and concentration of sperm, as well as a significant altering of their shape which is critical to their ability to move through the cervix and uterus, led to a state called OAT.

OAT is known scientifically as oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and is a common cause of low fertility among men.

The lead researcher on the study, PhD student Behzad Hajizadeh Maleki said: 'These effects on sperm cells are associated with lower sperm quality and reduced fertility potential.

'Although these effects tended to improve over time, they remained significantly and abnormally higher in the Covid-19 patients, and the magnitude of these changes were also related to disease severity.'

Although the Giessen team's findings seem worrying, other scientists say they want more research and longer term evidence to be convinced about Covid's real effects on fertility.

Male fertility is known to be affected by fevers because the testicles cannot function as well at high internal temperatures.

Fever is one of the most common symptoms of the coronavirus so this link could account for some of the damage seen in the team's study. Often the damage is reversible and reduces over time.

Professor Alison Murdoch, a fertility expert at Newcastle University, said: 'It is well documented that adverse changes are frequently seen after systemic illness with recovery typically taking at least 3 months.

'As the authors acknowledge, their findings may be such a nonspecific response. Thus, longer term studies are needed before the testes is considered to be a high-risk organ specific to Covid-19.

'It is important to note that there is no evidence of Covid-19 virus in the semen and that there is no evidence that virus can be transmitted via semen.'

Professor Allan Pacey, an expert in andrology at the University of Sheffield, also urged caution over the findings, saying: 'Since sperm production takes just under three months, roughly, to be completed from start to finish, in my opinion they ended the study 30 days too soon.'

Another study found last year that Covid-19 may be able to deplete testosterone stores in the body, which could be expected to have an impact on male fertility, which is controlled by the sex hormone.

2021-01-29 07:55:36+00:00,58,"Covid-19 could have a long-term effect on male fertility, a study in Germany has claimed.

Scientists compared semen quality in groups of men who had recovered from the virus to those who had never contracted it.

They found that having had Covid-19 appeared to lead to 'lower sperm quality and reduced fertility potential'.

The sperm were more likely to be deformed, the researchers found, to be less mobile and to be found in lower concentrations in the semen, which could make it more difficult to conceive.

Effects of Covid on people's ability to have children has not been widely studied because the disease has more devastating effects on the lungs, heart and blood vessels which have required more urgent scientific attention.

It was not exactly clear how coronavirus affected the testicles, the scientists said, although fever - a common symptom of Covid - is known to be able to damage them.

The damage to sperm quality appeared to reduce after time, with it returning towards normal levels as more time elapsed after infection, but the effects were worse in men who had been more severely ill.

Following the study, researchers advised men who survived Covid to have their reproductive health checked before trying for a baby - but warned their findings were not concrete.

Scientists in Germany found Covid-19 effected the shape, concentration and mobility of sperm, but experts say more research needs to be done - as even the common flu can have an impact on sperm count (stock image)

Experts at Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, analysed 84 men with Covid- 19 and 105 age-matched control subjects, without the virus, taking measurements every 10 days for 60 days.

The study found a significant deterioration in semen quality up to 60 days after the illness.

When they compared the two groups they found that indicators that could make a men less able to father a child were significantly more common among men who had had Covid.

COVID 'COULD TRIGGER LOW TESTOSTERONE' The coronavirus saps men's testosterone and leaves them more susceptible to falling seriously ill as well as robbing them of their sex drive, a study suggests. Researchers in Turkey analysed levels of the sex hormone in 200 men who were in hospital after they tested positive for Covid-19. More than half (51 per cent) had developed a condition called hypogonadism, in which their bodies did not produce enough testosterone. On average, participants' levels were drained by 30 per cent post-infection to borderline unhealthy levels. Academics claimed there was a direct correlation between severe illness and lower testosterone levels. But, even among men who showed no symptoms of the virus at all, two thirds reported having a lowered sex drive – a tell-tale sign of low testosterone. As well as being key in the development of sex organs and muscle growth, testosterone also helps regulate the immune responses, including fighting viral infections. Low levels have been linked to an increased risk of dying from the flu, as well as inflammation, heart disease and high blood pressure. University of Mersin scientists, behind the study, believe Covid-19 makes men more vulnerable to its nastier symptoms by hampering their immune systems. Lead author Professor Selahittin Çayan, a urologist at the university, said: 'In our study, the mean total testosterone decreased, as the severity of the Covid-19 increased.' The study was published in the journal The Aging Male. Advertisement

These included signs of swelling, sperm cell death and oxidative stress, which is when volatile chemicals build up in living tissues because of cells not working properly.

The concentration of sperm was reduced by up to 516 per cent and its mobility dropped by 209 per cent, the study said, although all the men were still confirmed to be fertile.

The reduction in mobility and concentration of sperm, as well as a significant altering of their shape which is critical to their ability to move through the cervix and uterus, led to a state called OAT.

OAT is known scientifically as oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and is a common cause of low fertility among men.

The lead researcher on the study, PhD student Behzad Hajizadeh Maleki said: 'These effects on sperm cells are associated with lower sperm quality and reduced fertility potential.

'Although these effects tended to improve over time, they remained significantly and abnormally higher in the Covid-19 patients, and the magnitude of these changes were also related to disease severity.'

Although the Giessen team's findings seem worrying, other scientists say they want more research and longer term evidence to be convinced about Covid's real effects on fertility.

Male fertility is known to be affected by fevers because the testicles cannot function as well at high internal temperatures.

Fever is one of the most common symptoms of the coronavirus so this link could account for some of the damage seen in the team's study. Often the damage is reversible and reduces over time.

Professor Alison Murdoch, a fertility expert at Newcastle University, said: 'It is well documented that adverse changes are frequently seen after systemic illness with recovery typically taking at least 3 months.

'As the authors acknowledge, their findings may be such a nonspecific response. Thus, longer term studies are needed before the testes is considered to be a high-risk organ specific to Covid-19.

'It is important to note that there is no evidence of Covid-19 virus in the semen and that there is no evidence that virus can be transmitted via semen.'

Professor Allan Pacey, an expert in andrology at the University of Sheffield, also urged caution over the findings, saying: 'Since sperm production takes just under three months, roughly, to be completed from start to finish, in my opinion they ended the study 30 days too soon.'

Another study found last year that Covid-19 may be able to deplete testosterone stores in the body, which could be expected to have an impact on male fertility, which is controlled by the sex hormone.

Researchers in Turkey analysed levels of the sex hormone in 200 men who were in hospital after they tested positive for Covid-19.

More than half (51 per cent) had developed a condition called hypogonadism, in which their bodies did not produce enough testosterone. On average, participants' levels were drained by 30 per cent post-infection to borderline unhealthy levels.

Carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the biggest contributors to global warming. After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there, making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.

It is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as cement production.

The average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, as of April 2019, is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration was just 280 ppm.

CO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800,000 years between 180 to 280ppm, but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.

Nitrogen dioxide

The gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels, car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.

Although there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2, it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.

Sulfur dioxide

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning, but can also be released from car exhausts.

SO2 can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.

Carbon monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with hydroxyl radicals, removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Particulates

What is particulate matter?

Particulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.

Some are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.

Materials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.

Particulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).

Air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels, cars, cement making and agriculture

Scientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.

Particulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels, driving cars and steel making.

Why are particulates dangerous?

Particulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.

Health impact

What sort of health problems can pollution cause?

According to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.

Some of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.

As well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.

Particulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.

Deaths from pollution

Around seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.

Asthma triggers

Air pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.

Problems in pregnancy

Women exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.

Living within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by University of Cincinnati found.

For every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.

Previous research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.

Paris agreement on climate change

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.

It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.

Carbon neutral by 2050

The UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.

They plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.

Some critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.

International carbon credits let nations continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.

No new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040

In 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.

However, MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.

Norway's electric car subsidies

The speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies. Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.

A VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.

Criticisms of inaction on climate change

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.

The committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed – from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains – and found no real progress in any of them.

The UK is not prepared for 2°C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4°C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.

It added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect, and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.",MailOnline,"['climate', 'uk', 'air', 'particulates', 'address', 'cars', 'urgent', 'burning', 'agreement', 'fossil', 'carbon', 'action', 'pollution', 'experts']",0
2021-01-28 21:18:30+00:00,15,"Air purifiers could be helping to spread Covid-19 in confined spaces such as lifts, a leading study has claimed.

The quality of air in small areas without proper ventilation usually requires a purifier to help kill viruses and bacteria - but there is no system proven to remove coronavirus at this time.

Scientists at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus carried out a study to see what would happen if a person coughed in a crowded lift.

Professor Dimitris Drikakis said: 'Our results show that installing an air purifier may increase the droplet spread.'

A 3D model created by scientists shows how air purification systems in lifts may help spread Covid-19 germs released after an infected person coughs

The study claims devices increase the rate of transmission by moving particles laden with the virus.

Air quality in small spaces would quickly diminish without proper ventilation.

So most modern elevators are equipped with air purifiers to remove any floating contaminants.

The machines use ultraviolet radiation to kill viruses and bacteria, which may be harmful.

The model created a lift that would have space to hold roughly five people, with scientists concluding: 'Installing an air purifier may increase the droplet spread.'

Scientists from the University of Nicosia say lifts should operate a lower capacity to minimise the risk of Covid-19 spreading

But sucking dirty air in and blowing clean air out adds to 'overall circulation', a problem which has not been considered until now.

A 3D model of a lift capable of holding five people was created by the researchers.

Ventilation and a purifier were added to the lift so the researchers could determine how they influenced air circulation.

A mild cough was then simulated in space to measure the spread of virus infected saliva droplets.

Using the same model, previous studies have found saliva droplets can travel 18 feet in five seconds when an unmasked person coughs.

The chances of catching the virus were lowest when the space had reduced ventilation, the researchers found.

Prof Drikakis added: 'We quantified the effect of air circulation on airborne virus transmission and showed that installing an air purifier inside an elevator alters the air circulation significantly but does not eliminate airborne transmission.'

People in the UK have been told to stay home since the government declared a national lockdown at the beginning of January.

But for those who are still going into the office or live in an apartment block, taking the lift may be part of their daily routine.

Professor Drikakis said: 'Our results show that installing an air purifier may increase the droplet spread.

Most modern elevators are equipped with air purifiers to remove any floating contaminants. Footage from the study shows how particles move around the 'lift', potentially coming into contact with people on board

The more people inside the elevator are infected with COVID-19, the more damage an air purifier causes, the researchers also found

'The air intake integrated inside the purifier equipment induces flow circulation that can add to the transport of contaminated saliva droplets in the cabin.'

The more people inside the elevator are infected with COVID-19, the more damage an air purifier causes, the researchers also found.

Professor Drikakis added: 'Restricting the number of people allowed in an elevator would minimise the spread of the virus as would better design of air purifier and ventilation systems.'

The findings were published in the journal Physics of Fluids.

Last year a report from Which? warned people that domestic air purifiers were not proven to remove 100 per cent of Covid particles from a room.

The watchdog said their effectiveness depended on factors including the size of the room and the type of filter used by the purifier and its age.",MailOnline,"['researchers', 'remove', 'air', 'study', 'spaces', 'spread', 'purifiers', 'lift', 'virus', 'covid19', 'confined', 'help', 'purifier']",0

This includes needing a cesarean, heavy bleeding after birth, elevated blood pressure and a premature delivery.

Data from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also found pregnant women with severe Covid-19 are more likely to die when compared to soon-to-be mothers with only mild case of coronavirus infection.

For the women who give birth while battling a moderate case of coronavirus, there is no increased risk of death or birth complications.

Pregnant women with Covid-19 who are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms are no more likely to die from the virus than non-pregnant women, a US study shows

Pregnant women who contract Covid-19 in their third trimester are unlikely to pass it on to their unborn babies Pregnant women who catch the coronavirus do not pass it on to their unborn children, according to data from a new study. US-based researchers followed 64 women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, between April 2 and June 13. None of the babies tested positive for Covid-19 after they were born, and no coronavirus was detected in the placenta. While the Harvard academics warn the small sample size makes it impossible to rule out that some pregnant women could pass the virus to their children, it shows the natural defences of pregnancy fend off the virus, they say. The expecting mothers were all in their third trimester and had the virus in their lungs, nose, and throat, but not in their bloodstream or placenta.

The CDC research found a correlation between mortality and pregnancy only in the worst cases.

The study, revealed today at a virtual conference held by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, examined medical records of 1,219 pregnant women who tested positive for Covid-19 at 33 hospitals in 14 US states between March and July last year.

Almost half of the women (47 per cent) were asymptomatic, 27 per cent had mild cases, 14 per cent were moderate, eight per cent were classed as severe, and four per cent critical.

Four of the women died, a fatality rate of 0.3 per cent. For pregnant women without Covid, the death rate in the US is 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births (0.017 per cent), according to CDC statistics.

'Our research shows that serious pregnancy complications appear to occur in women who have severe or critical cases of COVID and not those who have mild or moderate cases,' said the study's lead author, Dr Torri Metz, a maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist and associate professor at the University of Utah Health.

'This information helps us to counsel our patients more effectively.

'For pregnant women who have contracted a mild or moderate case of COVID-19, these findings can help to alleviate their fears that they are at an increased risk of having serious pregnancy complications due to the disease.'

The breakdown of figures reveals the minority of the study's pregnant women who were severely or critically ill were older and had a higher BMI and also more prone to underlying health conditions, such as COPD, diabetes and high blood pressure.

Data from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention found soon-to-be mothers who are struck down with a bad case of Covid-19 are more likely to experience complications with their pregnancy (stock)

These women were more likely than their healthier counterparts to die and also have a traumatic birthing process.

Complications include emergency caesarean, postpartum hemorrhaging and the baby being born prematurely

Age, weight and previous health conditions are all known comorbidities which increase the risk of death in the entire population, not just pregnant women.

'This study supports a growing body of evidence that shows for the small number of pregnant women who do get severely ill from COVID-19, there can be implications to the pregnancy, in particular it is more likely that their baby will be born prematurely which can affect their long-term health.

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change. Pictured: air pollution over Paris in 2019.

Norway's electric car subsidies

The speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies. Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.

A VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.

Criticisms of inaction on climate change

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.

The committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed – from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains – and found no real progress in any of them.

The UK is not prepared for 2°C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4°C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.

A team of doctors from the World Health Organisation today ended a 14-day Covid quarantine in the city of Wuhan and set off on a fact-finding mission to trace the origins of the virus.

The 13-strong team, which arrived in Wuhan on January 14, received documents certifying they had completed their isolation period Thursday morning before walking past journalists and on to a bus outside their hotel.

Medics were seen waving at hotel staff as their bus pulled away, though their destination was not clear.

Their task over the coming months will be to try and establish how the virus got from animals into humans to prevent future outbreaks but huge questions remain over where they will be allowed to go and who they will be allowed to speak with.

The WHO revealed on Thursday that the team will visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has been put forward as the site of a potential leak, alongside a seafood market where the disease was first detected but which has been widely discredited as the source.

The team will also have to negotiate a political minefield amid expectations that China will try to cover up embarrassing or incriminating evidence into the early stages of the virus, while jumping on any discoveries that appear to suggest the disease originated elsewhere.

Outlining the tightrope they will have to walk, the US on Wednesday demanded a 'robust and clear' investigation into the virus, which prompted nervous Beijing officials to say America should 'respect facts and science, respect the hard work of the WHO international... expert team'.

China has repeatedly delayed and obstructed the investigation, even denying two members of the team entry into the country due to positive antibody tests - even though they tested negative for active infections

The team will have to negotiate a political minefield amid suspicions that China will try to hide evidence that could prove embarrassing or incriminating, while jumping on any discovery that could suggest the virus originated elsewhere

Who is on the WHO team investigating the origins of the coronavirus? The WHO unveiled a 10-strong panel of investigators in November. It is not clear who the three extra members of the team are. The original team announced by WHO were: Thea Fischer, Denmark - Virologist and epidemiologist at University of Copenhagen and Nordsjaelland Hospital, previously worked at Denmark's State Serum Institute. Expert in epidemic control and vaccinology John Watson, UK - UK's deputy chief medical officer from 2013 to 2017, after helping lead response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also an honorary professor of epidemiology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Marion Koopmans, Netherlands - Dutch virologist who is head of the Erasmus Medical Centre department of viroscience in Rotterdam. Has written about spread of Covid-19 between humans and mink in Denmark Dominic Dwyer, Australia - Australian microbiologist at Westmead Clinical School in Sydney who helped grow the virus for research last February. Wants to investigate role of laboratories in the coronavirus outbreak Vladimir Dedkov, Russia - Epidemiologist and deputy director of research at the Institute Pasteur in Russia. Helped to diagnose Ebola patients during 2014 outbreak Hung Nguyen, Vietnam - Vietnamese biologist based at Kenya's International Livestock Research Institute who specialises in food safety risks in wet markets. Says the team will interview people from Wuhan food market Fabian Leendertz, Germany - Microbiologist at Germany's Robert Koch Institute who researches how viruses jump between animals and humans. Led researchers who tracked 2014 Ebola outbreak to a bat-filled tree in Guinea Peter Daszak, UK/US - British zoologist who is president of the US-based EcoHealth Alliance and has come under fire over links to the Wuhan virology lab and China's so-called 'bat woman' virologist Shi Zhengli Farag El Moubasher, Qatar - Epidemiologist at Qatar's ministry of public health who researches emerging diseases. Wrote a thesis on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a coronavirus which emerged from camels in 2012 and killed 858 people Ken Maeda, Japan - Director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. Has publications to his name about animal diseases and bat coronaviruses Advertisement

Former WHO official Keiji Fukuda, who is not part of the team in Wuhan, cautioned that breakthroughs are unlikely, saying it may take years before any firm conclusions can be made.

'This is now well over a year past when it all started,' he said. 'So much of the physical evidence is going to be gone. The memories of people are imprecise and probably the physical layout of many places are going to be different than they were and how people are moving about and so on.'

The mission has already had to pass through several road-blocks just to get to this stage, as China blocked and then delayed medics from arriving in the country.

On the day the team travelled, two medics were held back at Singapore airport after apparently testing positive for coronavirus antibodies - despite having tested negative for current infections on a gold-standard PCR test.

It was unclear this morning whether those two team members were ever allowed to travel. MailOnline has contacted the WHO for more information.

Some members of the team posted on social media this morning, showing off parts of their quarantine hotel rooms and the certificates they were given before boarding the bus.

Major questions remain over where the team will be allowed to go and who they will be allowed to speak to. While completing quarantine, the medics were permitted to speak with each-other and some Chinese doctors over video chat, the BBC reported, without giving further details about the discussions.

As the doctors boarded their bus, yellow barriers blocked the entrance to the hotel, keeping the media at a distance.

Before they boarded, workers in full protective gear could be seen loading their luggage onto the bus, including two musical instruments, a dumbbell and four yoga mattresses.

The mission only came about after considerable wrangling between the sides that led to a rare complaint from the WHO that China was taking too long to make final arrangements.

China, which has strongly opposed an independent investigation it could not fully control, said the matter was complicated and that medical staff were preoccupied with new virus clusters Beijing, Shanghai and other cities.

While the WHO was criticized early on, especially by the U.S., for not being critical enough of the Chinese response, it recently accused China and other countries of moving too slowly at the start of the outbreak, drawing a rare admission from the Chinese side that it could have done better.

Overall, though, China has staunchly defended its response, possibly out of concern over the reputational or even financial costs are being lacking.

Beijing has so far frustrated international efforts to track the origins of the virus, which has killed more than 2.1 million people globally.

Multiple countries have uncovered evidence that the virus was circulating months earlier than originally thought. While Beijing has tried to insist this proves the virus originated elsewhere, most scientists still think China was the origin - raising the prospect that communist officials simply hid evidence of the early spread

Chinese scientists and officials have been keen to point the finger of blame outside their own borders - variously suggesting that the virus could have originated in Bangladesh, the US, Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia or Serbia

'It's imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemic in China, and we've been supportive of an international investigation that we feel should be robust and clear,' White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

President Joe Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had enraged China by accusing it of a botched response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and had led calls for an independent investigation.

China has sought to deflect blame for the massive global human and economic toll by suggesting - without proof - that the virus emerged somewhere else.

A mounting body of evidence has pointed to the fact that Covid may have been circulating for months longer than initially thought, after blood samples taken in Europe before the initial start of the pandemic were later found to have traces of the virus in.

The earliest confirmed infection was in October in Italy, but blood samples taken in September have also shown signs of the infection - though these are being tested further amid doubts over the results.

While China has attempted to suggest that this is evidence the pathogen originated overseas before being imported into Wuhan, in fact the majority of scientists still believe China was the origin - meaning the virus was circulating there months earlier than originally thought.

It is possible that this viral spread was simply undetected by Beijing, but repeated attempts to cover up this evidence or point the finger elsewhere have led to suspicions of guilt.

The pandemic has surged despite many nations kicking off mass vaccination programs, and one major issue in recent weeks has been of demand for jabs far outstripping supply.

With cases surging across Europe, the EU has demanded that AstraZeneca make up for delays by supplying doses from its factories in the UK.

But Britain has told the firm to honor its delivery promises too as it tries to accelerate its program, even using historic sites such as the Salisbury Cathedral and Lord's cricket ground as vaccination centers.

AstraZeneca has said there is simply not enough to go around.

At least 90 million doses of that vaccine, which AstraZeneca developed with the University of Oxford, will be produced in Japan, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said Thursday, but local media said they may not be distributed until May.

Pfizer, which developed its successful vaccine with BioNTech, has revised higher its production target for this year from 1.3 billion doses to 2 billion.

While part of that is down to increased production, it is also impacted by a change in how the firm counts doses - after initially saying each vial contained five, the pharma giant now says six shots can be extracted.

Wuhan was the first place the disease was detected, in December 2019, but doubts remain over whether it is the first place the disease infected humans - a question that the team are trying to answer

Vaccines are considered critical to eventually defeating Covid-19, which has continued to re-emerge even in nations where it was brought under control.

New Zealand confirmed two new cases of the more virulent South African coronavirus strain on Thursday, days after an initial case that ended a run of more than two months without any community transmission.

The Pacific nation topped a list published Thursday by the Lowy Institute, a top Australian think tank, assessing almost 100 countries on how they managed the pandemic.

Brazil was ranked the worst, at number 98, with Mexico, Colombia, Iran and the United States also near the bottom.

Vietnam, which made the top 10, on Thursday reported its first community transmission in nearly two months.

The lack of success globally in containing the pandemic sparked doubts about whether the delayed Tokyo Olympics can be held at all this year.

But the head of the International Olympic Committee insisted organizers were focused on how - not if - the Games will be held.

'Our task is to organize Olympic Games, not to cancel Olympic Games,' said Thomas Bach.

A staggering 100 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, a grim Johns Hopkins University tally shows.

The virus that didn't exist two years ago spread to just shy of 13 percent of the global population in just over a year.

COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 2.1 million people, leaving economies in shreds and hardly a family untouched.

Since the virus emerged in Wuhan and turned the bustling metropolis to a ghost town, COVID-19's place or origin has managed the unthinkable: it is nearly back to normal.

But most of the world is a long way from 'normal.'

The US has more than a quarter of the world's cases and more than 3,000 Americans die of COVID-19. UK residents remain under the strictest set of lockdows the nation has seen yet and is still seeing the second highest number of new daily infections per one million people in the world.

Vaccines, the proverbial 'light at the end of the pandemic's tunnel, have arrived, but the rollout is agonizingly slow with less than 0.9 percent of the population having had a shot.

And super-infectious variants that have emerged in the UK, US, Brazil and South Africa amid surging case threaten to further overwhelm already cracked health systems, evade vaccines and undercut the hard-won progress the world has finally made against the pandemic.

As of Tuesday, more than 100 million people worldwide have been infected with coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. A quarter of those cases are in the US (pictures)

It has been just over a year after China first alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) that the mysterious wave of pneumonia cases in Wuhan - the largest city in the Hubei province - appeared to be caused by a new virus.

Scientists now think the virus was probably there months earlier. The Chinese government likely downplayed or altogether hid the earliest warning signs that a pandemic was brewing.

But even with an unprecedented flurry of scientific activity and international collaboration, things are, in some ways, worse than ever.

Monday alone, half a million new COVID-19 cases were recorded around the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That's down considerably from the nearly 858,000 global cases recorded on January 7, but is nearly double the number of cases being recorded across the world in the summer.

And it's not just the seasonality of the virus, or that it's spreading more but is not still a lethal threat. On Tuesday alone, 10,676 people died of COVID-19.

Again, daily fatalities have declined over the past week, from nearly 18,000 on January 20, but daily deaths have risen higher and stayed higher by far this winter than they've been at any previous point in the pandemic.

The US is once again a major driver in the global epidemic curve.

Months after New York City became the global epicenter of the pandemic, US daily case rates have ebbed somewhat since last month when the US saw its average number of new daily infections rise to 247,000.

But the US is still seeing more cases per day compared to its population than any country. Now, the seven-day rolling average number of daily cases is 170,000. More than 3,000 Americans are dying a day.

Despite lockdown implemented to contain the out-of-control spread of the 70 percent infectious B117 'super-covid' variant that emerged in the UK, the nation is still seeing the second greatest number of new infections per day of any in the world.

Cases as of Monday were back down to their previous highs in November, with 22,244 infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It seems that transmissions are beginning to ebb in the UK, and frustration is growing that lockdowns remain in place.

However, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that it appears the UK variant, B117, may make the virus 30 to 40 times deadlier than earlier forms of coronavirus were.

The variant was previously thought to be more infectious but no deadlier. The preliminary data suggesting its link to higher mortality rate is under review by both UK and US officials, but Dr Fauci said it did appear to show higher rates of death among people infected with the new B117 variant.

France is now seeing more than 320,000 new case a day, giving it the third highest number of daily infections of any country in the world.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced another round of lockdowns, in addition to a curfew that stretches from 6pm to 6am. Its restaurants, museums and tourist sites have been completely closed down since October.

More than half of the nation's ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, Macron said.

Brazil ranks fourth for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world - and that could be cause for global concern.

2020 is the deadliest year in U.S. history: America is on pace for more than 3.2 million total deaths including 347K killed by COVID, 75K pandemic-related fatalities and a record 81K fatal overdoses

Preliminary figures suggests 2020 will be the deadliest year in U.S. history.

A record 3,260,397 people died last year, which public health experts says is due to COVID-19, indirect pandemic deaths and overdoses.

That figure is about 15 percent higher than the 2,835,533 Americans who died in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

What's more, the early data shows April 2020 was the deadliest month with more than 322,000 deaths, nearly 10 percent of all deaths for that year.

Among other deadly years in American history include 1,430,079 deaths in 1918, the year of the Spanish Flu pandemic and the end of World War I; 1,459,544 deaths in 1943, the deadliest year of World War II and 1,930,082 deaths in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War.

It comes on the heels of new working paper, which found that the economic fallout from the pandemic could lead to 890,000 more U.S. deaths over the next 15 years.

It includes more than 347,000 people in the U.S. who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a death toll that has since risen to more than 406,000

'That is not a seasonal change or just a random bad year,' Dr Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told USA TODAY.

'That is what every person who can correctly attest to these numbers can plainly see is a historic increase in excess mortality.

'If we put that together with the number of coronavirus deaths, it's game, set, match.'

Some of the deaths are due to the common causes of deaths: cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and lung disease.

However, the toll of the pandemic cannot be understated.

In 2020, 347,341 people in the U.S. died due to COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since then, more than 58,000 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to more than 406,000 - higher than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.

In addition, an October 2020 study from Virginia Commonwealth and Yale universities found that nearly 75,000 deaths were indirectly caused by the pandemic.

Researchers say that, due to social distancing measures and the increasing demand place on hospitals, people may have delayed seeking life-saving medical care.

Co-author Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, says the high number may also be due to emotional crises or death certificates mislabeling a cause of death as due to COVID-19.

He estimates the true number of excess deaths his paper was published may be closer to 500,000.

'That's based on where we are right now, and unfortunately, we're seeing the numbers climbing, so the concern is obviously that we're going to end up with more excess deaths than that,' he told USA TODAY.

One study found an additional 75,000 people died indirectly due to the pandemic such as delaying seeking life-saving medical care (above)

Deaths have also been increasing due to a rise in overdose fatalities.

More than 81,000 fatalities occurred in the 12-month period ending in May 2020, a nearly 20 percent rise from the 12-month period ending in June 2019, according to an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, in 25 states, opioid-related deaths have soared by more than 20 percent over the 12-month period.

Health experts say the pandemic has created the perfect breeding ground for addiction with many turning to opioids to cope with job losses and the deaths of loved ones to the programs being canceled or replaced with telemedicine for those trying to maintain sobriety.

The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,' said then-CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.

'As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it's important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.'

Only four states have reported a decrease in overdose deaths, and 25 states have reported increases of more than 20%

It comes as a new working paper suggests the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an elevated mortality rate in the U.S.

Researchers from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities, found that the country's mortality rate could increase by 3 percent over the next 15 years.

At the same time, life expectancy could drop to 0.5 percent, translating into an additional 890,000 deaths.

The economic crisis will also disproportionately affect the black community, with 33 out of every 100,000 African Americans dying.

'African-Americans experience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent,' the researchers wrote.

'The effects on life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall.

A record 3,260,397 people died last year, which public health experts says is due to COVID-19, indirect pandemic deaths and overdoses.

But even with an unprecedented flurry of scientific activity and international collaboration, things are, in some ways, worse than ever.

Monday alone, half a million new COVID-19 cases were recorded around the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That's down considerably from the nearly 858,000 global cases recorded on January 7, but is nearly double the number of cases being recorded across the world in the summer.

And it's not just the seasonality of the virus, or that it's spreading more but is not still a lethal threat. On Tuesday alone, 10,676 people died of COVID-19.

Again, daily fatalities have declined over the past week, from nearly 18,000 on January 20, but daily deaths have risen higher and stayed higher by far this winter than they've been at any previous point in the pandemic.

The US is once again a major driver in the global epidemic curve.

Months after New York City became the global epicenter of the pandemic, US daily case rates have ebbed somewhat since last month when the US saw its average number of new daily infections rise to 247,000.

But the US is still seeing more cases per day compared to its population than any country. Now, the seven-day rolling average number of daily cases is 170,000. More than 3,000 Americans are dying a day.

Despite lockdown implemented to contain the out-of-control spread of the 70 percent infectious B117 'super-covid' variant that emerged in the UK, the nation is still seeing the second greatest number of new infections per day of any in the world.

Cases as of Monday were back down to their previous highs in November, with 22,244 infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It seems that transmissions are beginning to ebb in the UK, and frustration is growing that lockdowns remain in place.

However, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that it appears the UK variant, B117, may make the virus 30 to 40 times deadlier than earlier forms of coronavirus were.

The variant was previously thought to be more infectious but no deadlier. The preliminary data suggesting its link to higher mortality rate is under review by both UK and US officials, but Dr Fauci said it did appear to show higher rates of death among people infected with the new B117 variant.

France is now seeing more than 320,000 new case a day, giving it the third highest number of daily infections of any country in the world.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced another round of lockdowns, in addition to a curfew that stretches from 6pm to 6am. Its restaurants, museums and tourist sites have been completely closed down since October.

More than half of the nation's ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, Macron said.

Brazil ranks fourth for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world - and that could be cause for global concern.

2020 is the deadliest year in U.S. history: America is on pace for more than 3.2 million total deaths including 347K killed by COVID, 75K pandemic-related fatalities and a record 81K fatal overdoses

Preliminary figures suggests 2020 will be the deadliest year in U.S. history.

A record 3,260,397 people died last year, which public health experts says is due to COVID-19, indirect pandemic deaths and overdoses.

That figure is about 15 percent higher than the 2,835,533 Americans who died in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

What's more, the early data shows April 2020 was the deadliest month with more than 322,000 deaths, nearly 10 percent of all deaths for that year.

Among other deadly years in American history include 1,430,079 deaths in 1918, the year of the Spanish Flu pandemic and the end of World War I; 1,459,544 deaths in 1943, the deadliest year of World War II and 1,930,082 deaths in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War.

It comes on the heels of new working paper, which found that the economic fallout from the pandemic could lead to 890,000 more U.S. deaths over the next 15 years.

It includes more than 347,000 people in the U.S. who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a death toll that has since risen to more than 406,000

'That is not a seasonal change or just a random bad year,' Dr Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told USA TODAY.

'That is what every person who can correctly attest to these numbers can plainly see is a historic increase in excess mortality.

'If we put that together with the number of coronavirus deaths, it's game, set, match.'

Some of the deaths are due to the common causes of deaths: cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and lung disease.

However, the toll of the pandemic cannot be understated.

In 2020, 347,341 people in the U.S. died due to COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since then, more than 58,000 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to more than 406,000 - higher than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.

In addition, an October 2020 study from Virginia Commonwealth and Yale universities found that nearly 75,000 deaths were indirectly caused by the pandemic.

Researchers say that, due to social distancing measures and the increasing demand place on hospitals, people may have delayed seeking life-saving medical care.

Co-author Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, says the high number may also be due to emotional crises or death certificates mislabeling a cause of death as due to COVID-19.

He estimates the true number of excess deaths his paper was published may be closer to 500,000.

'That's based on where we are right now, and unfortunately, we're seeing the numbers climbing, so the concern is obviously that we're going to end up with more excess deaths than that,' he told USA TODAY.

One study found an additional 75,000 people died indirectly due to the pandemic such as delaying seeking life-saving medical care (above)

Deaths have also been increasing due to a rise in overdose fatalities.

More than 81,000 fatalities occurred in the 12-month period ending in May 2020, a nearly 20 percent rise from the 12-month period ending in June 2019, according to an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, in 25 states, opioid-related deaths have soared by more than 20 percent over the 12-month period.

Health experts say the pandemic has created the perfect breeding ground for addiction with many turning to opioids to cope with job losses and the deaths of loved ones to the programs being canceled or replaced with telemedicine for those trying to maintain sobriety.

The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,' said then-CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.

'As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it's important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.'

Only four states have reported a decrease in overdose deaths, and 25 states have reported increases of more than 20%

It comes as a new working paper suggests the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an elevated mortality rate in the U.S.

Researchers from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities, found that the country's mortality rate could increase by 3 percent over the next 15 years.

At the same time, life expectancy could drop to 0.5 percent, translating into an additional 890,000 deaths.

The economic crisis will also disproportionately affect the black community, with 33 out of every 100,000 African Americans dying.

'African-Americans experience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent,' the researchers wrote.

'The effects on life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall.

The world is marking Holocaust Memorial Day in the midst of the pandemic today as memorial events take place online and vulnerable survivors shield from the coronavirus on the 76th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation.

The Auschwitz museum is holding a virtual event emphasising the fate of the 200,000 children who were murdered at the Nazi death camp, where only 700 youngsters remained alive when the Red Army arrived on January 27, 1945.

The survivors who were young then are now among the most vulnerable to a disease that preys on the elderly, especially because many of them suffer medical problems caused by their inhuman treatment at German hands.

German chancellor Angela Merkel will speak at an online event later with the UN-secretary general, while parliament is meeting for an in-person commemoration in Berlin where Hitler's regime oversaw the genocide of six million Jews.

Pope Francis called for remembrance today while Israel's president Reuven Rivlin will join a virtual event in a country where many Holocaust survivors have already been inoculated against Covid-19 a world-leading vaccine drive.

Hundreds of surviving victims in Austria and Slovakia were also poised to get their first vaccines on Wednesday to mark the anniversary.

Auschwitz, pictured in 1945, was liberated by Soviet troops 76 years ago on Wednesday after around 1.1million people were murdered at the Nazi extermination camp

The president of the European Jewish Congress said on Monday that some Holocaust survivors had died alone or suffered 'extreme isolation' because of the pandemic.

'Throughout their lives, they have shown mighty strength of spirit, but in the current crisis, many have sadly died alone and in pain,' Dr Moshe Kantor said.

'Therefore, I call on European leaders to ensure that Holocaust survivors have access as soon as possible to a safe and effective vaccination and with the highest priority.'

He also warned that conspiracy theories and extremism had spread during the pandemic, alluding to how social and economic crisis helped bring Hitler to power and thereby unleash the Holocaust.

'The pandemic has created the social conditions where antisemitism and extremism thrive,' he warned.

At Auschwitz, a memorial event will be streamed on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the museum's website later on Wednesday.

The main theme will be the fate of children in Auschwitz, who made up nearly a fifth of the 1.1million people killed at the extermination camp.

'200,000 children were murdered in Auschwitz. Completely innocent, good, curious about life, loving their closest ones, trusting children,' said museum director Piotr Cwyinski.

'The adult world - after all, so often unjust and cruel - has never demonstrated so much of its heartlessness, its evil.

'This cannot be justified by any ideology, reckoning or politics. This year we want to dedicate the anniversary of liberation to the youngest victims of the camp.'

While many commemorations have moved online for the first time, one constant is the drive of survivors to tell their stories as words of caution.

'We have to tell our stories so it doesn't happen again,' 91-year-old survivor Rose Schindler said on Monday from her home in California.

'It is unbelievable what we went through, and the whole world was silent as this was going on.'

Friedman says she believes it is her role to 'sound the alarm' about rising anti-Semitism and other hatred in the world, otherwise 'another tragedy may happen.'

That hatred, she said, was on clear view when a mob inspired by former US president Donald Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6.

Some insurrectionists wore clothes with anti-Semitic messages like 'Camp Auschwitz' and '6MWE,' which stands for '6 million wasn't enough.'

At the Vatican today, the Pope marked the anniversary by urging people to watch out for extremism because 'these things can happen again'.

'To remember is an expression of humanity. To remember is a sign of civility. To remember is a condition for a better future of peace and fraternity,' he said.

'To remember also means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity.'

In Germany, the government says it wants to use the digital format to 'reach more people than ever' and educate them about the Holocaust.

'Millions of people were victims of the Nazis. That makes the repeated efforts to exploit, relativise or forget that suffering for political purposes all the more unbearable,' said German culture minister Monika Gruetters.

Angela Merkel will give the keynote address later at an online event organised by the UN, UNESCO and the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).

The ceremony will be followed by a panel discussion on Holocaust denial involving a survivor of the genocide and leading historians.

IHRA chair Michaela Kuechler said: 'Remembrance plays a critical role in fighting the persistent forces of antisemitism and Holocaust denial and distortion.

'This is because remembrance ties us fundamentally to the facts, to what took place and the people it affected.

'When we remember, when we strive to reflect upon this suffering, we understand that as unimaginable as it is, it is just as undeniable.'

Merkel and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier were present at a special session of parliament in Berlin this morning where lawmakers were due to hear from a survivor who later became president of Germany's top Jewish organisation.

In Austria, more than 400 survivors were expected to get a coronavirus vaccine at Vienna's largest vaccination centre to mark the memorial day on Wednesday.

Mostly in their 80s or 90s, many of them were being brought in by shuttle or ambulance while others were escorted by their children.

'We owe this to them,' said Erika Jakubovits of the Jewish Community of Vienna. 'They have suffered so much trauma and have felt even more insecure during this pandemic.'

Jakubovits organized the vaccination drive with the Austrian health ministry and officials in Vienna, where twelve Jewish doctors volunteered to give the vaccines.

In a similar project to that in Vienna, the Jewish community of Bratislava in Slovakia was also set to vaccinate survivors on Wednesday.

'We're very, very grateful that the vaccinations are taking place on this symbolic day,' said Tomas Stern, the head of the Jewish community in Bratislava.

Some 128 survivors were to receive their first shot at Bratislava's Jewish community center on Wednesday and another 330 across the country in the coming days.

In Israel, home to many Holocaust survivors, more than 80 per cent of those over 70 have already received at least one dose of the vaccine, and nearly 60 per cent have received the second dose.

Because Israel's vaccination campaign has moved so quickly, there was no need to single out Holocaust survivors.

Still, about 900 Holocaust survivors died of Covid-19 in Israel last year before vaccines were available and about 5,300 survivors were infected, according to Israel's national statistics office.",MailOnline,"['president', '76', 'survivors', 'remember', 'auschwitz', 'liberation', 'holocaust', 'marks', 'day', 'victims', 'berlin', 'memorial', 'world', 'jewish']",0

Police on the island of Koh Phangan arrested 89 tourists at 22 Thais after storming the Three Sixty Bar on Tuesday night.

Among the locals arrests was the bar's owner and another who sold drinks there, according to police Col. Suparerk Pankosol, superintendent of the provincial immigration office.

He said the gathering was illegal under a national state of emergency declared last March to combat the coronavirus.

Police on the island of Koh Phangan raided the Three Sixty Bar on Tuesday night and discovered more than 100 people inside, including tourists from Britain, the US, Denmark and Switzerland

Thailand is currently has barred virtually all tourists from entering the country since April, with an emergency decree banning people from attending public gatherings and entering high risk areas.

Those arrested were from more than 10 countries, including the U.S., Britain, Switzerland and Denmark, Suparerk said.

Photos of the raid distributed by police showed a dark, crowded room with casually dressed partygoers, almost all wearing face masks.

Koh Phangan in Surat Thani province is a popular destination for young backpacking travelers and is known especially for its all-night Full Moon beach parties.

However, Thailand has barred virtually all tourists from entering the country since last April.

There have been 29 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Surat Thani out of a national total of 15,465.

Local police say they arrested 22 locals, including the bar's owner and another person who ws selling drinks. Emergency Covid legislation in Thailand bans people from public gatherings

However, 11 of the 29 cases have been found in the last month as Thailand experienced a resurgence of the disease.

The penalty for violating the state of emergency is up to two years´ imprisonment and a fine of up to 40,000 baht ($1,330).

The bar owner and worker could also be charged with violating the Communicable Disease Act, punishable by a one-year prison term and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($3,330).

Suparerk said the arrested people were being held at the Koh Phangan police station, where investigators were preparing documents to charge them.

He said police had tracked the party plans on social media, where the bar was promoting the event to celebrate its fifth anniversary.

A staggering 100 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, a grim Johns Hopkins University tally shows.

The virus that didn't exist two years ago spread to just shy of 13 percent of the global population in just over a year.

COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 2.1 million people, leaving economies in shreds and hardly a family untouched.

Since the virus emerged in Wuhan and turned the bustling metropolis to a ghost town, COVID-19's place or origin has managed the unthinkable: it is nearly back to normal.

But most of the world is a long way from 'normal.'

The US has more than a quarter of the world's cases and more than 3,000 Americans die of COVID-19. UK residents remain under the strictest set of lockdows the nation has seen yet and is still seeing the second highest number of new daily infections per one million people in the world.

Vaccines, the proverbial 'light at the end of the pandemic's tunnel, have arrived, but the rollout is agonizingly slow with less than 0.9 percent of the population having had a shot.

And super-infectious variants that have emerged in the UK, US, Brazil and South Africa amid surging case threaten to further overwhelm already cracked health systems, evade vaccines and undercut the hard-won progress the world has finally made against the pandemic.

As of Tuesday, more than 100 million people worldwide have been infected with coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. A quarter of those cases are in the US (pictures)

It has been just over a year after China first alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) that the mysterious wave of pneumonia cases in Wuhan - the largest city in the Hubei province - appeared to be caused by a new virus.

Scientists now think the virus was probably there months earlier. The Chinese government likely downplayed or altogether hid the earliest warning signs that a pandemic was brewing.

But even with an unprecedented flurry of scientific activity and international collaboration, things are, in some ways, worse than ever.

Monday alone, half a million new COVID-19 cases were recorded around the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That's down considerably from the nearly 858,000 global cases recorded on January 7, but is nearly double the number of cases being recorded across the world in the summer.

And it's not just the seasonality of the virus, or that it's spreading more but is not still a lethal threat. On Tuesday alone, 10,676 people died of COVID-19.

Again, daily fatalities have declined over the past week, from nearly 18,000 on January 20, but daily deaths have risen higher and stayed higher by far this winter than they've been at any previous point in the pandemic.

The US is once again a major driver in the global epidemic curve.

Months after New York City became the global epicenter of the pandemic, US daily case rates have ebbed somewhat since last month when the US saw its average number of new daily infections rise to 247,000.

But the US is still seeing more cases per day compared to its population than any country. Now, the seven-day rolling average number of daily cases is 170,000. More than 3,000 Americans are dying a day.

Despite lockdown implemented to contain the out-of-control spread of the 70 percent infectious B117 'super-covid' variant that emerged in the UK, the nation is still seeing the second greatest number of new infections per day of any in the world.

Cases as of Monday were back down to their previous highs in November, with 22,244 infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It seems that transmissions are beginning to ebb in the UK, and frustration is growing that lockdowns remain in place.

However, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that it appears the UK variant, B117, may make the virus 30 to 40 times deadlier than earlier forms of coronavirus were.

The variant was previously thought to be more infectious but no deadlier. The preliminary data suggesting its link to higher mortality rate is under review by both UK and US officials, but Dr Fauci said it did appear to show higher rates of death among people infected with the new B117 variant.

France is now seeing more than 320,000 new case a day, giving it the third highest number of daily infections of any country in the world.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced another round of lockdowns, in addition to a curfew that stretches from 6pm to 6am. Its restaurants, museums and tourist sites have been completely closed down since October.

More than half of the nation's ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, Macron said.

Brazil ranks fourth for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world - and that could be cause for global concern.

2020 is the deadliest year in U.S. history: America is on pace for more than 3.2 million total deaths including 347K killed by COVID, 75K pandemic-related fatalities and a record 81K fatal overdoses

Preliminary figures suggests 2020 will be the deadliest year in U.S. history.

A record 3,260,397 people died last year, which public health experts says is due to COVID-19, indirect pandemic deaths and overdoses.

That figure is about 15 percent higher than the 2,835,533 Americans who died in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

What's more, the early data shows April 2020 was the deadliest month with more than 322,000 deaths, nearly 10 percent of all deaths for that year.

Among other deadly years in American history include 1,430,079 deaths in 1918, the year of the Spanish Flu pandemic and the end of World War I; 1,459,544 deaths in 1943, the deadliest year of World War II and 1,930,082 deaths in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War.

It comes on the heels of new working paper, which found that the economic fallout from the pandemic could lead to 890,000 more U.S. deaths over the next 15 years.

It includes more than 347,000 people in the U.S. who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a death toll that has since risen to more than 406,000

'That is not a seasonal change or just a random bad year,' Dr Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told USA TODAY.

'That is what every person who can correctly attest to these numbers can plainly see is a historic increase in excess mortality.

'If we put that together with the number of coronavirus deaths, it's game, set, match.'

Some of the deaths are due to the common causes of deaths: cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and lung disease.

However, the toll of the pandemic cannot be understated.

In 2020, 347,341 people in the U.S. died due to COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since then, more than 58,000 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to more than 406,000 - higher than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.

In addition, an October 2020 study from Virginia Commonwealth and Yale universities found that nearly 75,000 deaths were indirectly caused by the pandemic.

Researchers say that, due to social distancing measures and the increasing demand place on hospitals, people may have delayed seeking life-saving medical care.

Co-author Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, says the high number may also be due to emotional crises or death certificates mislabeling a cause of death as due to COVID-19.

He estimates the true number of excess deaths his paper was published may be closer to 500,000.

'That's based on where we are right now, and unfortunately, we're seeing the numbers climbing, so the concern is obviously that we're going to end up with more excess deaths than that,' he told USA TODAY.

One study found an additional 75,000 people died indirectly due to the pandemic such as delaying seeking life-saving medical care (above)

Deaths have also been increasing due to a rise in overdose fatalities.

More than 81,000 fatalities occurred in the 12-month period ending in May 2020, a nearly 20 percent rise from the 12-month period ending in June 2019, according to an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, in 25 states, opioid-related deaths have soared by more than 20 percent over the 12-month period.

Health experts say the pandemic has created the perfect breeding ground for addiction with many turning to opioids to cope with job losses and the deaths of loved ones to the programs being canceled or replaced with telemedicine for those trying to maintain sobriety.

The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,' said then-CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.

'As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it's important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.'

Only four states have reported a decrease in overdose deaths, and 25 states have reported increases of more than 20%

It comes as a new working paper suggests the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an elevated mortality rate in the U.S.

Researchers from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities, found that the country's mortality rate could increase by 3 percent over the next 15 years.

At the same time, life expectancy could drop to 0.5 percent, translating into an additional 890,000 deaths.

The economic crisis will also disproportionately affect the black community, with 33 out of every 100,000 African Americans dying.

'African-Americans experience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent,' the researchers wrote.

'The effects on life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall.

The world is marking Holocaust Memorial Day in the midst of the pandemic today as memorial events take place online and vulnerable survivors shield from the coronavirus on the 76th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation.

The Auschwitz museum is holding a virtual event emphasising the fate of the 200,000 children who were murdered at the Nazi death camp, where only 700 youngsters remained alive when the Red Army arrived on January 27, 1945.

The survivors who were young then are now among the most vulnerable to a disease that preys on the elderly, especially because many of them suffer medical problems caused by their inhuman treatment at German hands.

German chancellor Angela Merkel will speak at an online event later with the UN-secretary general, while parliament is meeting for an in-person commemoration in Berlin where Hitler's regime oversaw the genocide of six million Jews.

Pope Francis called for remembrance today while Israel's president Reuven Rivlin will join a virtual event in a country where many Holocaust survivors have already been inoculated against Covid-19 a world-leading vaccine drive.

Hundreds of surviving victims in Austria and Slovakia were also poised to get their first vaccines on Wednesday to mark the anniversary.

Auschwitz, pictured in 1945, was liberated by Soviet troops 76 years ago on Wednesday after around 1.1million people were murdered at the Nazi extermination camp

The president of the European Jewish Congress said on Monday that some Holocaust survivors had died alone or suffered 'extreme isolation' because of the pandemic.

'Throughout their lives, they have shown mighty strength of spirit, but in the current crisis, many have sadly died alone and in pain,' Dr Moshe Kantor said.

'Therefore, I call on European leaders to ensure that Holocaust survivors have access as soon as possible to a safe and effective vaccination and with the highest priority.'

He also warned that conspiracy theories and extremism had spread during the pandemic, alluding to how social and economic crisis helped bring Hitler to power and thereby unleash the Holocaust.

'The pandemic has created the social conditions where antisemitism and extremism thrive,' he warned.

At Auschwitz, a memorial event will be streamed on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the museum's website later on Wednesday.

The main theme will be the fate of children in Auschwitz, who made up nearly a fifth of the 1.1million people killed at the extermination camp.

'200,000 children were murdered in Auschwitz. Completely innocent, good, curious about life, loving their closest ones, trusting children,' said museum director Piotr Cwyinski.

'The adult world - after all, so often unjust and cruel - has never demonstrated so much of its heartlessness, its evil.

'This cannot be justified by any ideology, reckoning or politics. This year we want to dedicate the anniversary of liberation to the youngest victims of the camp.'

While many commemorations have moved online for the first time, one constant is the drive of survivors to tell their stories as words of caution.

'We have to tell our stories so it doesn't happen again,' 91-year-old survivor Rose Schindler said on Monday from her home in California.

'It is unbelievable what we went through, and the whole world was silent as this was going on.'

Friedman says she believes it is her role to 'sound the alarm' about rising anti-Semitism and other hatred in the world, otherwise 'another tragedy may happen.'

That hatred, she said, was on clear view when a mob inspired by former US president Donald Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6.

Some insurrectionists wore clothes with anti-Semitic messages like 'Camp Auschwitz' and '6MWE,' which stands for '6 million wasn't enough.'

At the Vatican today, the Pope marked the anniversary by urging people to watch out for extremism because 'these things can happen again'.

'To remember is an expression of humanity. To remember is a sign of civility. To remember is a condition for a better future of peace and fraternity,' he said.

'To remember also means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity.'

In Germany, the government says it wants to use the digital format to 'reach more people than ever' and educate them about the Holocaust.

'Millions of people were victims of the Nazis. That makes the repeated efforts to exploit, relativise or forget that suffering for political purposes all the more unbearable,' said German culture minister Monika Gruetters.

Angela Merkel will give the keynote address later at an online event organised by the UN, UNESCO and the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).

The ceremony will be followed by a panel discussion on Holocaust denial involving a survivor of the genocide and leading historians.

IHRA chair Michaela Kuechler said: 'Remembrance plays a critical role in fighting the persistent forces of antisemitism and Holocaust denial and distortion.

'This is because remembrance ties us fundamentally to the facts, to what took place and the people it affected.

'When we remember, when we strive to reflect upon this suffering, we understand that as unimaginable as it is, it is just as undeniable.'

Merkel and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier were present at a special session of parliament in Berlin this morning where lawmakers were due to hear from a survivor who later became president of Germany's top Jewish organisation.

In Austria, more than 400 survivors were expected to get a coronavirus vaccine at Vienna's largest vaccination centre to mark the memorial day on Wednesday.

Mostly in their 80s or 90s, many of them were being brought in by shuttle or ambulance while others were escorted by their children.

'We owe this to them,' said Erika Jakubovits of the Jewish Community of Vienna. 'They have suffered so much trauma and have felt even more insecure during this pandemic.'

Jakubovits organized the vaccination drive with the Austrian health ministry and officials in Vienna, where twelve Jewish doctors volunteered to give the vaccines.

In a similar project to that in Vienna, the Jewish community of Bratislava in Slovakia was also set to vaccinate survivors on Wednesday.

'We're very, very grateful that the vaccinations are taking place on this symbolic day,' said Tomas Stern, the head of the Jewish community in Bratislava.

Some 128 survivors were to receive their first shot at Bratislava's Jewish community center on Wednesday and another 330 across the country in the coming days.

In Israel, home to many Holocaust survivors, more than 80 per cent of those over 70 have already received at least one dose of the vaccine, and nearly 60 per cent have received the second dose.

Because Israel's vaccination campaign has moved so quickly, there was no need to single out Holocaust survivors.

Still, about 900 Holocaust survivors died of Covid-19 in Israel last year before vaccines were available and about 5,300 survivors were infected, according to Israel's national statistics office.",MailOnline,"['president', '76', 'survivors', 'remember', 'auschwitz', 'liberation', 'holocaust', 'marks', 'day', 'victims', 'berlin', 'memorial', 'world', 'jewish']",0
2021-01-27 09:03:20+00:00,53,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that Moderna's coronavirus vaccine should not be used on pregnant women - affecting more than three million expectant mothers in the U.S.

No vaccine trials to date have included pregnant women - and they are not expected to until after the first quarter of 2021 - meaning there is no safety data, the WHO says.

Researchers want to determine the vaccines are safe and effective in healthy, non-pregnant people before testing them in mothers-to-be and their future children.

'While pregnancy puts women at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the use of this vaccine in pregnant women is currently not recommended, unless they are at risk of high exposure,' the WHO's statement released on Tuesday read.

Pregnant women at high risk include those who are frontline healthcare workers or having underlying conditions.

This is the same guidance that the WHO issued about the Pfizer vaccine just three weeks earlier.

But doctors in the U.S. have opposed pregnant women being excluded from vaccine recommendations due to their high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and say the patients should decide themselves whether or not they want the shot.

The World Health Organization has recommended that pregnant women not receive Moderna's coronavirus vaccine due to a lack of safety data and should only be immunized if they are at high risk. Pictured: A health worker administers a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 at Clalit Health Services, in Tel Aviv, January 23

The WHO's recommendation will affect more than three million pregnant women in the U.S. as the country continues to vaccinate about 1.25 million people every day (above)

In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, WHO's director of immunization Kate O'Brien stressed that clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine are needed on pregnant women.

'There is no reason to think there could be a problem in pregnancy, we are just acknowledging the data is not there at the moment,' she said.

However, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has been staunchly against the exclusion of pregnant women from vaccination trials and guidance.

In a statement, the organization wrote that pregnant women should choose themselves whether or not they want to be vaccinated and be informed of any risks.

'Pregnant individuals are more likely to have certain manifestations of severe illness associated with COVID-19 infection such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death,' the statement reads.

'Further, upwards of half of pregnant individuals also fall into another high-priority category, including frontline workers and those with underlying conditions.

'ACOG continues to urge that for pregnant individuals, the decision to vaccinate must be left to each patient in consult with their trusted clinician.'

There is currently no data on how many women became pregnant during Moderna's coroanvirus vaccine trial.

However, during the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) advisory committee meeting on recommending whether or not approve Pfizer's vaccine - the only other shot approved in the U.S. - researchers revealed 23 pregnancies occurred during the trial as of November 14.

Of the pregnancies, 12 were among the vaccine group and 11 were among the placebo group.

In the vaccine group, four were immunized prior to their last menstrual period, four within 30 days after their last menstrual period and four more than 30 days after.

In the placebo group, two wee inoculated prior to their last menstrual period, six within 30 days after their last menstrual period and two more than 30 days after.

No outcomes are known yet aside from one woman in the placebo group who had a miscarriage at less than 20 weeks' gestation.

It is not uncommon to not include pregnant women in vaccine trials.

Many gynecologists have opposed pregnant women being excluded from vaccine recommendations because pregnant COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be admitted to ICUs and three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation (above)

For example, expecting mothers have never been included in flu shot studies, but have been encouraged by doctors to get it after years of data showing the jab behaved normally in healthy participants.

Doctors say they are concerned about pregnant women not receiving the coronavirus vaccine because millions of pregnant or breastfeeding women make up the workforce.

In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 75 percent of the health-care workforce are female and about 330,000 healthcare workers 'could be pregnant or recently postpartum at time of vaccine implementation.'

What's more, data from the CDC show pregnant COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be admitted to ICUs and three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-pregnant women with the disease.

Recently, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine called on the federal government to include pregnant and lactating women in vaccine trials.

And, in an op-ed in STAT News, three professors from Johns Hopkins urged the FDA to allow pregnant or postpartum healthcare workers to be allowed to receive the shot.

'We disagree with the position of the UK authorities that may make it impossible for pregnant or lactating health workers to get the vaccine regardless of their circumstances,' they wrote.

'If we are unable to offer vaccines to pregnant or lactating frontline health workers, it is incumbent upon health care systems to offer them alternative protection strategies such as shielding, reassignment, or paid leave.

'Yet this may not be a viable strategy for most health care facilities, which cannot afford to operate without a significant portion of their workforce.'

Expectant women have not been included in clinical trials and researchers are waiting to see if any women in studies became pregnant as an early indicator. Pictured: A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is seen at a local clinic

In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued guidelines last month making it clear pregnant women should not be inoculated until after they have given birth.

The government said this applies for vaccines that have been or could be approved, including those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca Plc.

Women who think they might be pregnant are urged to delay vaccination until they are certain they are not, and those trying for a baby should not be immunized either.

'Currently there is not enough evidence to recommend vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19,' Dr Mary Ross Davie from the UK's Royal College of Midwives said at the time.

'There is no evidence of harm, but there is also no current evidence of safety as pregnant women were, as is normal, excluded from all of the vaccination trials.'",MailOnline,"['data', 'likely', 'workers', 'women', 'moderna', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trials', 'covid19', 'pregnant', 'risk']",0

A staggering 100 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, a grim Johns Hopkins University tally shows.

The virus that didn't exist two years ago spread to just shy of 13 percent of the global population in just over a year.

COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 2.1 million people, leaving economies in shreds and hardly a family untouched.

That's down considerably from the nearly 858,000 global cases recorded on January 7, but is nearly double the number of cases being recorded across the world in the summer.

And it's not just the seasonality of the virus, or that it's spreading more but is not still a lethal threat. On Tuesday alone, 10,676 people died of COVID-19.

Again, daily fatalities have declined over the past week, from nearly 18,000 on January 20, but daily deaths have risen higher and stayed higher by far this winter than they've been at any previous point in the pandemic.

The US is once again a major driver in the global epidemic curve.

Months after New York City became the global epicenter of the pandemic, US daily case rates have ebbed somewhat since last month when the US saw its average number of new daily infections rise to 247,000.

But the US is still seeing more cases per day compared to its population than any country. Now, the seven-day rolling average number of daily cases is 170,000. More than 3,000 Americans are dying a day.

Despite lockdown implemented to contain the out-of-control spread of the 70 percent infectious B117 'super-covid' variant that emerged in the UK, the nation is still seeing the second greatest number of new infections per day of any in the world.

Cases as of Monday were back down to their previous highs in November, with 22,244 infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It seems that transmissions are beginning to ebb in the UK, and frustration is growing that lockdowns remain in place.

However, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that it appears the UK variant, B117, may make the virus 30 to 40 times deadlier than earlier forms of coronavirus were.

The variant was previously thought to be more infectious but no deadlier. The preliminary data suggesting its link to higher mortality rate is under review by both UK and US officials, but Dr Fauci said it did appear to show higher rates of death among people infected with the new B117 variant.

France is now seeing more than 320,000 new case a day, giving it the third highest number of daily infections of any country in the world.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced another round of lockdowns, in addition to a curfew that stretches from 6pm to 6am. Its restaurants, museums and tourist sites have been completely closed down since October.

More than half of the nation's ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, Macron said.

Brazil ranks fourth for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world - and that could be cause for global concern.

2020 is the deadliest year in U.S. history: America is on pace for more than 3.2 million total deaths including 347K killed by COVID, 75K pandemic-related fatalities and a record 81K fatal overdoses

Preliminary figures suggests 2020 will be the deadliest year in U.S. history.

A record 3,260,397 people died last year, which public health experts says is due to COVID-19, indirect pandemic deaths and overdoses.

That figure is about 15 percent higher than the 2,835,533 Americans who died in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

What's more, the early data shows April 2020 was the deadliest month with more than 322,000 deaths, nearly 10 percent of all deaths for that year.

Among other deadly years in American history include 1,430,079 deaths in 1918, the year of the Spanish Flu pandemic and the end of World War I; 1,459,544 deaths in 1943, the deadliest year of World War II and 1,930,082 deaths in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War.

It comes on the heels of new working paper, which found that the economic fallout from the pandemic could lead to 890,000 more U.S. deaths over the next 15 years.

It includes more than 347,000 people in the U.S. who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a death toll that has since risen to more than 406,000

'That is not a seasonal change or just a random bad year,' Dr Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told USA TODAY.

'That is what every person who can correctly attest to these numbers can plainly see is a historic increase in excess mortality.

'If we put that together with the number of coronavirus deaths, it's game, set, match.'

Some of the deaths are due to the common causes of deaths: cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and lung disease.

However, the toll of the pandemic cannot be understated.

In 2020, 347,341 people in the U.S. died due to COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since then, more than 58,000 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to more than 406,000 - higher than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.

In addition, an October 2020 study from Virginia Commonwealth and Yale universities found that nearly 75,000 deaths were indirectly caused by the pandemic.

Researchers say that, due to social distancing measures and the increasing demand place on hospitals, people may have delayed seeking life-saving medical care.

Co-author Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, says the high number may also be due to emotional crises or death certificates mislabeling a cause of death as due to COVID-19.

He estimates the true number of excess deaths his paper was published may be closer to 500,000.

'That's based on where we are right now, and unfortunately, we're seeing the numbers climbing, so the concern is obviously that we're going to end up with more excess deaths than that,' he told USA TODAY.

One study found an additional 75,000 people died indirectly due to the pandemic such as delaying seeking life-saving medical care (above)

Deaths have also been increasing due to a rise in overdose fatalities.

More than 81,000 fatalities occurred in the 12-month period ending in May 2020, a nearly 20 percent rise from the 12-month period ending in June 2019, according to an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, in 25 states, opioid-related deaths have soared by more than 20 percent over the 12-month period.

Health experts say the pandemic has created the perfect breeding ground for addiction with many turning to opioids to cope with job losses and the deaths of loved ones to the programs being canceled or replaced with telemedicine for those trying to maintain sobriety.

The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,' said then-CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.

'As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it's important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.'

Only four states have reported a decrease in overdose deaths, and 25 states have reported increases of more than 20%

It comes as a new working paper suggests the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an elevated mortality rate in the U.S.

Researchers from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities, found that the country's mortality rate could increase by 3 percent over the next 15 years.

At the same time, life expectancy could drop to 0.5 percent, translating into an additional 890,000 deaths.

The economic crisis will also disproportionately affect the black community, with 33 out of every 100,000 African Americans dying.

'African-Americans experience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent,' the researchers wrote.

'The effects on life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall.

A staggering 100 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, a grim Johns Hopkins University tally shows.

The virus that didn't exist two years ago spread to just shy of 13 percent of the global population in just over a year.

COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 2.1 million people, leaving economies in shreds and hardly a family untouched.

Since the virus emerged in Wuhan and turned the bustling metropolis to a ghost town, COVID-19's place or origin has managed the unthinkable: it is nearly back to normal.

But most of the world is a long way from 'normal.'

The US has more than a quarter of the world's cases and more than 3,000 Americans die of COVID-19. UK residents remain under the strictest set of lockdows the nation has seen yet and is still seeing the second highest number of new daily infections per one million people in the world.

Vaccines, the proverbial 'light at the end of the pandemic's tunnel, have arrived, but the rollout is agonizingly slow with less than 0.9 percent of the population having had a shot.

And super-infectious variants that have emerged in the UK, US, Brazil and South Africa amid surging case threaten to further overwhelm already cracked health systems, evade vaccines and undercut the hard-won progress the world has finally made against the pandemic.

As of Tuesday, more than 100 million people worldwide have been infected with coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. A quarter of those cases are in the US (pictures)

The US (dark purple still has more new cases per day per one million people in its population in the world, with the UK close behind (fuschia). France and Brazil are also seeing high rates of new infections per day. Brazil's crisis may be driven by a more infectious new variant there

It has been just over a year after China first alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) that the mysterious wave of pneumonia cases in Wuhan - the largest city in the Hubei province - appeared to be caused by a new virus.

Scientists now think the virus was probably there months earlier. The Chinese government likely downplayed or altogether hid the earliest warning signs that a pandemic was brewing.

But even with an unprecedented flurry of scientific activity and international collaboration, things are, in some ways, worse than ever.

Monday alone, half a million new COVID-19 cases were recorded around the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That's down considerably from the nearly 858,000 global cases recorded on January 7, but is nearly double the number of cases being recorded across the world in the summer.

And it's not just the seasonality of the virus, or that it's spreading more but is not still a lethal threat. On Tuesday alone, 10,676 people died of COVID-19.

Again, daily fatalities have declined over the past week, from nearly 18,000 on January 20, but daily deaths have risen higher and stayed higher by far this winter than they've been at any previous point in the pandemic.

2021-01-27 06:04:05+00:00,88,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that Moderna's coronavirus vaccine should not be used on pregnant women - affecting more than three million expectant mothers in the U.S.

No vaccine trials to date have included pregnant women - and they are not expected to until after the first quarter of 2021 - meaning there is no safety data, the WHO says.

Researchers want to determine the vaccines are safe and effective in healthy, non-pregnant people before testing them in mothers-to-be and their future children.

'While pregnancy puts women at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the use of this vaccine in pregnant women is currently not recommended, unless they are at risk of high exposure,' the WHO's statement released on Tuesday read.

Pregnant women at high risk include those who are frontline healthcare workers or having underlying conditions.

This is the same guidance that the WHO issued about the Pfizer vaccine just three weeks earlier.

But doctors in the U.S. have opposed pregnant women being excluded from vaccine recommendations due to their high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and say the patients should decide themselves whether or not they want the shot.

The World Health Organization has recommended that pregnant women not receive Moderna's coronavirus vaccine due to a lack of safety data and should only be immunized if they are at high risk. Pictured: A health worker administers a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 at Clalit Health Services, in Tel Aviv, January 23

The WHO's recommendation will affect more than three million pregnant women in the U.S. as the country continues to vaccinate about 1.25 million people every day (above)

In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, WHO's director of immunization Kate O'Brien stressed that clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine are needed on pregnant women.

'There is no reason to think there could be a problem in pregnancy, we are just acknowledging the data is not there at the moment,' she said.

However, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has been staunchly against the exclusion of pregnant women from vaccination trials and guidance.

In a statement, the organization wrote that pregnant women should choose themselves whether or not they want to be vaccinated and be informed of any risks.

'Pregnant individuals are more likely to have certain manifestations of severe illness associated with COVID-19 infection such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death,' the statement reads.

'Further, upwards of half of pregnant individuals also fall into another high-priority category, including frontline workers and those with underlying conditions.

'ACOG continues to urge that for pregnant individuals, the decision to vaccinate must be left to each patient in consult with their trusted clinician.'

There is currently no data on how many women became pregnant during Moderna's coroanvirus vaccine trial.

However, during the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) advisory committee meeting on recommending whether or not approve Pfizer's vaccine - the only other shot approved in the U.S. - researchers revealed 23 pregnancies occurred during the trial as of November 14.

Of the pregnancies, 12 were among the vaccine group and 11 were among the placebo group.

In the vaccine group, four were immunized prior to their last menstrual period, four within 30 days after their last menstrual period and four more than 30 days after.

In the placebo group, two wee inoculated prior to their last menstrual period, six within 30 days after their last menstrual period and two more than 30 days after.

No outcomes are known yet aside from one woman in the placebo group who had a miscarriage at less than 20 weeks' gestation.

It is not uncommon to not include pregnant women in vaccine trials.

Many gynecologists have opposed pregnant women being excluded from vaccine recommendations because pregnant COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be admitted to ICUs and three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation (above)

For example, expecting mothers have never been included in flu shot studies, but have been encouraged by doctors to get it after years of data showing the jab behaved normally in healthy participants.

Doctors say they are concerned about pregnant women not receiving the coronavirus vaccine because millions of pregnant or breastfeeding women make up the workforce.

In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 75 percent of the health-care workforce are female and about 330,000 healthcare workers 'could be pregnant or recently postpartum at time of vaccine implementation.'

What's more, data from the CDC show pregnant COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be admitted to ICUs and three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-pregnant women with the disease.

Recently, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine called on the federal government to include pregnant and lactating women in vaccine trials.

And, in an op-ed in STAT News, three professors from Johns Hopkins urged the FDA to allow pregnant or postpartum healthcare workers to be allowed to receive the shot.

'We disagree with the position of the UK authorities that may make it impossible for pregnant or lactating health workers to get the vaccine regardless of their circumstances,' they wrote.

'If we are unable to offer vaccines to pregnant or lactating frontline health workers, it is incumbent upon health care systems to offer them alternative protection strategies such as shielding, reassignment, or paid leave.

'Yet this may not be a viable strategy for most health care facilities, which cannot afford to operate without a significant portion of their workforce.'

Expectant women have not been included in clinical trials and researchers are waiting to see if any women in studies became pregnant as an early indicator. Pictured: A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is seen at a local clinic

In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued guidelines last month making it clear pregnant women should not be inoculated until after they have given birth.

The government said this applies for vaccines that have been or could be approved, including those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca Plc.

Women who think they might be pregnant are urged to delay vaccination until they are certain they are not, and those trying for a baby should not be immunized either.

'Currently there is not enough evidence to recommend vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19,' Dr Mary Ross Davie from the UK's Royal College of Midwives said at the time.

'There is no evidence of harm, but there is also no current evidence of safety as pregnant women were, as is normal, excluded from all of the vaccination trials.'",MailOnline,"['data', 'likely', 'workers', 'women', 'moderna', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trials', 'covid19', 'pregnant', 'risk']",0

A staggering 100 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, a grim Johns Hopkins University tally shows.

The virus that didn't exist two years ago spread to just shy of 13 percent of the global population in just over a year.

COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 2.1 million people, leaving economies in shreds and hardly a family untouched.

Since the virus emerged in Wuhan and turned the bustling metropolis to a ghost town, COVID-19's place or origin has managed the unthinkable: it is nearly back to normal.

But most of the world is a long way from 'normal.'

The US has more than a quarter of the world's cases and more than 3,000 Americans die of COVID-19. UK residents remain under the strictest set of lockdows the nation has seen yet and is still seeing the second highest number of new daily infections per one million people in the world.

Vaccines, the proverbial 'light at the end of the pandemic's tunnel, have arrived, but the rollout is agonizingly slow with less than 0.9 percent of the population having had a shot.

And super-infectious variants that have emerged in the UK, US, Brazil and South Africa amid surging case threaten to further overwhelm already cracked health systems, evade vaccines and undercut the hard-won progress the world has finally made against the pandemic.

As of Tuesday, more than 100 million people worldwide have been infected with coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. A quarter of those cases are in the US (pictures)

It has been just over a year after China first alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) that the mysterious wave of pneumonia cases in Wuhan - the largest city in the Hubei province - appeared to be caused by a new virus.

Scientists now think the virus was probably there months earlier. The Chinese government likely downplayed or altogether hid the earliest warning signs that a pandemic was brewing.

But even with an unprecedented flurry of scientific activity and international collaboration, things are, in some ways, worse than ever.

Monday alone, half a million new COVID-19 cases were recorded around the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That's down considerably from the nearly 858,000 global cases recorded on January 7, but is nearly double the number of cases being recorded across the world in the summer.

And it's not just the seasonality of the virus, or that it's spreading more but is not still a lethal threat. On Tuesday alone, 10,676 people died of COVID-19.

Again, daily fatalities have declined over the past week, from nearly 18,000 on January 20, but daily deaths have risen higher and stayed higher by far this winter than they've been at any previous point in the pandemic.

The US is once again a major driver in the global epidemic curve.

Months after New York City became the global epicenter of the pandemic, US daily case rates have ebbed somewhat since last month when the US saw its average number of new daily infections rise to 247,000.

But the US is still seeing more cases per day compared to its population than any country. Now, the seven-day rolling average number of daily cases is 170,000. More than 3,000 Americans are dying a day.

Despite lockdown implemented to contain the out-of-control spread of the 70 percent infectious B117 'super-covid' variant that emerged in the UK, the nation is still seeing the second greatest number of new infections per day of any in the world.

Cases as of Monday were back down to their previous highs in November, with 22,244 infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It seems that transmissions are beginning to ebb in the UK, and frustration is growing that lockdowns remain in place.

However, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that it appears the UK variant, B117, may make the virus 30 to 40 times deadlier than earlier forms of coronavirus were.

The variant was previously thought to be more infectious but no deadlier. The preliminary data suggesting its link to higher mortality rate is under review by both UK and US officials, but Dr Fauci said it did appear to show higher rates of death among people infected with the new B117 variant.

France is now seeing more than 320,000 new case a day, giving it the third highest number of daily infections of any country in the world.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced another round of lockdowns, in addition to a curfew that stretches from 6pm to 6am. Its restaurants, museums and tourist sites have been completely closed down since October.

More than half of the nation's ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, Macron said.

Brazil ranks fourth for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world - and that could be cause for global concern.

2020 is the deadliest year in U.S. history: America is on pace for more than 3.2 million total deaths including 347K killed by COVID, 75K pandemic-related fatalities and a record 81K fatal overdoses

Preliminary figures suggests 2020 will be the deadliest year in U.S. history.

A record 3,260,397 people died last year, which public health experts says is due to COVID-19, indirect pandemic deaths and overdoses.

That figure is about 15 percent higher than the 2,835,533 Americans who died in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

What's more, the early data shows April 2020 was the deadliest month with more than 322,000 deaths, nearly 10 percent of all deaths for that year.

Among other deadly years in American history include 1,430,079 deaths in 1918, the year of the Spanish Flu pandemic and the end of World War I; 1,459,544 deaths in 1943, the deadliest year of World War II and 1,930,082 deaths in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War.

It comes on the heels of new working paper, which found that the economic fallout from the pandemic could lead to 890,000 more U.S. deaths over the next 15 years.

It includes more than 347,000 people in the U.S. who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a death toll that has since risen to more than 406,000

'That is not a seasonal change or just a random bad year,' Dr Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told USA TODAY.

'That is what every person who can correctly attest to these numbers can plainly see is a historic increase in excess mortality.

'If we put that together with the number of coronavirus deaths, it's game, set, match.'

Some of the deaths are due to the common causes of deaths: cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and lung disease.

However, the toll of the pandemic cannot be understated.

In 2020, 347,341 people in the U.S. died due to COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since then, more than 58,000 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to more than 406,000 - higher than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.

In addition, an October 2020 study from Virginia Commonwealth and Yale universities found that nearly 75,000 deaths were indirectly caused by the pandemic.

Researchers say that, due to social distancing measures and the increasing demand place on hospitals, people may have delayed seeking life-saving medical care.

Co-author Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, says the high number may also be due to emotional crises or death certificates mislabeling a cause of death as due to COVID-19.

He estimates the true number of excess deaths his paper was published may be closer to 500,000.

'That's based on where we are right now, and unfortunately, we're seeing the numbers climbing, so the concern is obviously that we're going to end up with more excess deaths than that,' he told USA TODAY.

One study found an additional 75,000 people died indirectly due to the pandemic such as delaying seeking life-saving medical care (above)

Deaths have also been increasing due to a rise in overdose fatalities.

More than 81,000 fatalities occurred in the 12-month period ending in May 2020, a nearly 20 percent rise from the 12-month period ending in June 2019, according to an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, in 25 states, opioid-related deaths have soared by more than 20 percent over the 12-month period.

Health experts say the pandemic has created the perfect breeding ground for addiction with many turning to opioids to cope with job losses and the deaths of loved ones to the programs being canceled or replaced with telemedicine for those trying to maintain sobriety.

The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,' said then-CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.

'As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it's important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.'

Only four states have reported a decrease in overdose deaths, and 25 states have reported increases of more than 20%

It comes as a new working paper suggests the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an elevated mortality rate in the U.S.

Researchers from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities, found that the country's mortality rate could increase by 3 percent over the next 15 years.

At the same time, life expectancy could drop to 0.5 percent, translating into an additional 890,000 deaths.

The economic crisis will also disproportionately affect the black community, with 33 out of every 100,000 African Americans dying.

'African-Americans experience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent,' the researchers wrote.

'The effects on life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall.

In 2020, 347,341 people in the U.S. died due to COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since then, more than 58,000 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to more than 406,000 - higher than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.

In addition, an October 2020 study from Virginia Commonwealth and Yale universities found that nearly 75,000 deaths were indirectly caused by the pandemic.

Researchers say that, due to social distancing measures and the increasing demand place on hospitals, people may have delayed seeking life-saving medical care.

Co-author Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, says the high number may also be due to emotional crises or death certificates mislabeling a cause of death as due to COVID-19.

He estimates the true number of excess deaths his paper was published may be closer to 500,000.

'That's based on where we are right now, and unfortunately, we're seeing the numbers climbing, so the concern is obviously that we're going to end up with more excess deaths than that,' he told USA TODAY.

One study found an additional 75,000 people died indirectly due to the pandemic such as delaying seeking life-saving medical care (above)

Deaths have also been increasing due to a rise in overdose fatalities.

More than 81,000 fatalities occurred in the 12-month period ending in May 2020, a nearly 20 percent rise from the 12-month period ending in June 2019, according to an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, in 25 states, opioid-related deaths have soared by more than 20 percent over the 12-month period.

Health experts say the pandemic has created the perfect breeding ground for addiction with many turning to opioids to cope with job losses and the deaths of loved ones to the programs being canceled or replaced with telemedicine for those trying to maintain sobriety.

The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,' said then-CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.

'As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it's important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.'

More than 81,000 drug overdoses deaths have occurred in the U.S. over the 12-month period ending in May 2020 (far left)

Only four states have reported a decrease in overdose deaths, and 25 states have reported increases of more than 20%

It comes as a new working paper suggests the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an elevated mortality rate in the U.S.

Researchers from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities, found that the country's mortality rate could increase by 3 percent over the next 15 years.

At the same time, life expectancy could drop to 0.5 percent, translating into an additional 890,000 deaths.

The economic crisis will also disproportionately affect the black community, with 33 out of every 100,000 African Americans dying.

'African-Americans experience larger unemployment shocks and the effects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent,' the researchers wrote.

2021-01-26 19:10:09+00:00,76,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that Moderna's coronavirus vaccine should not be used on pregnant women - affecting more than three million expectant mothers in the U.S.

No vaccine trials to date have included pregnant women - and they are not expected to until after the first quarter of 2021 - meaning there is no safety data, the WHO says.

Researchers want to determine the vaccines are safe and effective in healthy, non-pregnant people before testing them in mothers-to-be and their future children.

'While pregnancy puts women at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the use of this vaccine in pregnant women is currently not recommended, unless they are at risk of high exposure,' the WHO's statement released on Tuesday read.

Pregnant women at high risk include those who are frontline healthcare workers or having underlying conditions.

This is the same guidance that the WHO issued about the Pfizer vaccine just three weeks earlier.

But doctors in the U.S. have opposed pregnant women being excluded from vaccine recommendations due to their high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and say the patients should decide themselves whether or not they want the shot.

The World Health Organization has recommended that pregnant women not receive Moderna's coronavirus vaccine due to a lack of safety data and should only be immunized if they are at high risk. Pictured: A health worker administers a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 at Clalit Health Services, in Tel Aviv, January 23

The WHO's recommendation will affect more than three million pregnant women in the U.S. as the country continues to vaccinate about 1.25 million people every day (above)

In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, WHO's director of immunization Kate O'Brien stressed that clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine are needed on pregnant women.

'There is no reason to think there could be a problem in pregnancy, we are just acknowledging the data is not there at the moment,' she said.

However, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has been staunchly against the exclusion of pregnant women from vaccination trials and guidance.

In a statement, the organization wrote that pregnant women should choose themselves whether or not they want to be vaccinated and be informed of any risks.

'Pregnant individuals are more likely to have certain manifestations of severe illness associated with COVID-19 infection such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death,' the statement reads.

'Further, upwards of half of pregnant individuals also fall into another high-priority category, including frontline workers and those with underlying conditions.

'ACOG continues to urge that for pregnant individuals, the decision to vaccinate must be left to each patient in consult with their trusted clinician.'

There is currently no data on how many women became pregnant during Moderna's coroanvirus vaccine trial.

However, during the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) advisory committee meeting on recommending whether or not approve Pfizer's vaccine - the only other shot approved in the U.S. - researchers revealed 23 pregnancies occurred during the trial as of November 14.

Of the pregnancies, 12 were among the vaccine group and 11 were among the placebo group.

In the vaccine group, four were immunized prior to their last menstrual period, four within 30 days after their last menstrual period and four more than 30 days after.

In the placebo group, two wee inoculated prior to their last menstrual period, six within 30 days after their last menstrual period and two more than 30 days after.

No outcomes are known yet aside from one woman in the placebo group who had a miscarriage at less than 20 weeks' gestation.

It is not uncommon to not include pregnant women in vaccine trials.

Many gynecologists have opposed pregnant women being excluded from vaccine recommendations because pregnant COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be admitted to ICUs and three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation (above)

For example, expecting mothers have never been included in flu shot studies, but have been encouraged by doctors to get it after years of data showing the jab behaved normally in healthy participants.

Doctors say they are concerned about pregnant women not receiving the coronavirus vaccine because millions of pregnant or breastfeeding women make up the workforce.

In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 75 percent of the health-care workforce are female and about 330,000 healthcare workers 'could be pregnant or recently postpartum at time of vaccine implementation.'

What's more, data from the CDC show pregnant COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be admitted to ICUs and three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-pregnant women with the disease.

Recently, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine called on the federal government to include pregnant and lactating women in vaccine trials.

And, in an op-ed in STAT News, three professors from Johns Hopkins urged the FDA to allow pregnant or postpartum healthcare workers to be allowed to receive the shot.

'We disagree with the position of the UK authorities that may make it impossible for pregnant or lactating health workers to get the vaccine regardless of their circumstances,' they wrote.

'If we are unable to offer vaccines to pregnant or lactating frontline health workers, it is incumbent upon health care systems to offer them alternative protection strategies such as shielding, reassignment, or paid leave.

'Yet this may not be a viable strategy for most health care facilities, which cannot afford to operate without a significant portion of their workforce.'

Expectant women have not been included in clinical trials and researchers are waiting to see if any women in studies became pregnant as an early indicator. Pictured: A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is seen at a local clinic

In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued guidelines last month making it clear pregnant women should not be inoculated until after they have given birth.

The government said this applies for vaccines that have been or could be approved, including those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca Plc.

Women who think they might be pregnant are urged to delay vaccination until they are certain they are not, and those trying for a baby should not be immunized either.

'Currently there is not enough evidence to recommend vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19,' Dr Mary Ross Davie from the UK's Royal College of Midwives said at the time.

'There is no evidence of harm, but there is also no current evidence of safety as pregnant women were, as is normal, excluded from all of the vaccination trials.'",MailOnline,"['data', 'likely', 'workers', 'women', 'moderna', 'health', 'vaccine', 'trials', 'covid19', 'pregnant', 'risk']",0

The new coronavirus drug, called Immofon, is based on a USSR medicine used against leprosy. It has been developed from the antibiotic Dapsone and is designed to activate tissue metabolism and to stimulate the regeneration process of cells.

The cytokine storm is a deranged immune-system response to the virus, which many experts believe is behind the most severe cases of Covid-19.

The announcement came one day after President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced he had tested positive for coronavirus.

With Mexico City's hospitals at 89 per cent capacity, many city residents have had a very difficult time finding a hospital with room for a sick relative

The Mexican president's announcement of his COVID-19 diagnosis just a few hours after taking a commercial flight unleashed renewed criticism of his handling of the pandemic, which has left the country with the fourth-highest death toll worldwide.

Lopez Obrador, who has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure, said Sunday evening he was being treated for mild symptoms of COVID-19 after attending meetings and public events in preceding days.

The news capped the deadliest week of the coronavirus pandemic in the country and left questions unanswered about how many people had been close to the president during his three-day visit to parts of northern and central Mexico.

'How irresponsible and careless of him just to get onto a flight knowing that he might be infected,' said Jesus Ortega, a former leader of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and one-time ally of the president.

'The problem is he's the president. If the president violates the health guidelines, he's setting a bad example to others,' said Ortega, wishing Lopez Obrador a quick recovery.

The government said Lopez Obrador's symptoms began on Sunday, but it was not clear exactly when. The president announced his positive test result 6 1/2 hours after the plane from the central city of San Luis Potosi reached the capital.

2021-01-26 03:35:06+00:00,32,"COVID-19 has left scores of survivors with bizarre had debilitating neurological effects that range from mani to neurological episodes, a new report reveals.

A 40-year-old teacher who has spent his life communicating with a classroom of students found himself with a stutter for the first time in his life.

'I realized that some of the words didn’t feel right in my mouth, you know?' said Patrick Thornton, a math teacher in Houston Texas.

While sick with coronavirus in August, he had fairly typical, moderate symptoms: a headache, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, a sore throat that made him lose his voice.

But even once he was on the road to recovery, something was off.

'I got my voice back but it broke my mouth,' Thornton told Scientific American.

'That was terrifying.'

As President Joe Biden has spoken to many times, stress can trigger a stutter in a person who has one, but the underlying cause of the speech disorder is a more complicated series of neurological issues.

For months, it's been undeniable that coronavirus attacks the brain, with infected people becoming stroke-prone, or developing encephalitis.

And then there are the case reports of psychosis, or surveys of 'long-covid' sufferers like one given to 153 UK patients - a third of them reported neurological symptoms such as brain swelling, 'dementia-like' memory problems and 'altered mental status.'

The writing is on the wall, but what exactly is happening is unclear - and it could take years of research to work out why the virus continues to haunt the brains of survivors.

COVID-19 sufferers report neurological effects that range from stutters to psychosis. Scientists suspect that these long-lasting and bizzare symptoms may be the result of a haywire immune response to coronavirus infection causing inflammation and damage to neurons and synaptic connections

Thornton's doctors insist that once whatever stress he's under subsides, his stutter will too.

But in the meantime, he tells Scientific American it has gotten worse.

He's not alone. Amanda Wood, an Indianapolis mother developed a stutter after surviving COVID-19 in March, she told WTHR.

By August, it hadn't gotten any better and she is hoping to take part in a Johns Hopkins University study of COVID-19 long-haulers with neurological issues to find out what's wrong.

'While stress and anxiety are not the cause of stutter, they do exacerbate it,' Soo-Eun Chang, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, tells Scientific American.

'Speech is one of the more complex movement behaviors that humans perform.

'There are literally 100 muscles involved that have to coordinate on a millisecond time scale, so it’s a significant feat. And it depends on a well-functioning brain.'

The brain is both powerful and delicate.

A Lancet study found that up as many as 86% of COVID-19 survivors suffered neurological effects like brain inflammation and altered mental states

Brain cells and the connections that allow them to communicate the complex series of commands in every day actions like speech can be easily damaged by inflammation.

COVID-19 is notorious for the inflammatory response it triggers.

What begins as an immune effort to fend off the virus can quickly go awry, attacking and even killing healthy tissues.

This so-called cytokine storm became known as the real killer in many, if not the majority, of fatal COVID-19 cases.

And the bran is not immune.

'An immune-mediated attack on synaptic connections could lead to a change in brain function,' Dr Chang said.

Coronavirus itself can also sneak into the brain.

The nasal passage is one of its favorite points of entry into the human body and gives it a clear path to the brain.

Researchers in Berlin were among the first to trace the virus's route from the mucosa of the nasal passageway to the olfactory bulbs - neuron receivers of scent information that is then sent deeper into the brain for processing - and even to the brain stem.

The process likely underlies the loss of smell suffered by up to 86 percent of people with otherwise mild infections. Some go several months without recovering their senses of smell.

But the virus didn't seem to veer off path to other regions of the brain.

Another theory suggests that a sort of viral debris - infectious proteins detached from a dying viral particle - could cross the blood-brain-barrier and, even if it can't fully infect brain cells, wreak havoc.

Or, it could be that the virus sets off an eerie conversion of the antibodies meant to fight it into 'autoantibodies' that incorrectly learn that healthy tissues like the brain are the invaders, and start attacking them.

Scientists think that whatever is causing the neurological symptoms suffered by people like Thornton and Wood, it's likely a result of the interaction of the human immune system and the brain more than the virus itself and the brain.

But undoing the damage is a more complicated question, and could leave a rash of mental illnesses and chronic neurological issues in its wake.",MailOnline,"['symptoms', 'survivors', 'stutter', 'stress', 'develop', 'neurological', 'virus', 'stutters', 'covid19', 'effects', 'bizarre', 'suffered', 'scientific', 'brain', 'thornton']",0
2021-01-26 03:05:04+00:00,12,"Cigarette smokers face a much higher risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 compared to those who have never smoked, a new study suggests.

Researchers found that all smokers had higher odds of poor outcomes due to the virus, but those at the highest risk were heavy smokers, defined as those smoking at least one pack per day for more than 30 years.

These patients had nearly double the risk of death due to COVID-19 and were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized because of the disease.

The team, from the Cleveland Clinic, says its findings are the most complete evidence to date of a cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and an elevated risk of severe illness and death.

It comes as health officials in states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania have prioritized smokers in the lines to received the COVID-19 vaccine.

A new study from the Cleveland Clinic found that patients smoking one pack per day for more than 30 years (far right) were more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 than those who had never smoked before (far left)

Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic looked at more than 7,000 coronavirus patients, including more than 6,000 never-smokers and the rest being current or former smokers (file image)

Research linking smoking status with severe COVID-19 infection and death has been limited and contradictory.

Early last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that cigarettes can increase the risk of contracting the disease.

'People who smoke cigarettes may be at increased risk of infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, and may have worse outcomes from COVID-19,' the agency said in a statement.

The FDA has previously warned about 'worse outcomes' for coronavirus among smokers but did not specify what that meant.

In addition, a French study found that only 4.4 percent of 350 coronavirus patients hospitalized were regular smokers and theorized that nicotine could prevent the virus from infecting cells.

For the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, the team examined data for all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 within the Cleveland Clinic Health system in Ohio and Florida between March 8, 2020 and August 25, 2020.

Patients smoking for more than 30 years were 1.9 times more likely to die from the virus than those who had never smoked before. Pictured: Chaplain Kevin Deegan places his hand on the head of a COVID-19 patient while praying for him at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Los Angeles, January 9, 2021

The study also found people smoking for zero to 10 years had a 1.6 times higher odds of death and people smoking for 10 to 30 years had a 1.5 times greater risk of death than never-smokers.

Of the 7,102 patients, the majority - 84.8 percent or 6,020 - had never smoked before.

Nearly 13 percent were former smokers and about 2.4 percent were current smokers.

A total of 341 were or had been smoking one pack per day between zero and 10 years, 400 had been doing so for 10 to 30 years, and 341 smoked one pack per day for more than 30 years.

Results showed that the longer patients had been smoking for, the higher their risks were for hospitalization and death.

Patients who had been smoking at least one pack per day for between 10 and 30 years were nearly 1.5 times more likely to be hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 than patients who were never-smokers.

Interestingly, although negligible, the risk of death was slightly higher among patients smoking for less than 10 years, who had a 1.6 times higher odds of dying than people who have never smoked.

Those consuming one pack per day for more than 30 years were 2.25 times more likely to be hospitalized from the disease.

Both also had about 1.5 times higher odds of being admitted to the ICU.

When it came to risk of death, people smoking for zero to 10 years had a 1.6 times higher odds of death, people smoking for 10 to 30 years had a 1.5 times greater risk of death than never-smokers.

For those smoking at least a pack per day for more than 30 years, patients were 1.9 times likely to die.

The team said there was no difference in the risk of hospital admission and death between current and former smokers.

The Mexican president's announcement of his COVID-19 diagnosis just a few hours after taking a commercial flight unleashed renewed criticism of his handling of the pandemic, which has left the country with the fourth-highest death toll worldwide.

Lopez Obrador, who has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure, said Sunday evening he was being treated for mild symptoms of COVID-19 after attending meetings and public events in preceding days.

The news capped the deadliest week of the coronavirus pandemic in the country and left questions unanswered about how many people had been close to the president during his three-day visit to parts of northern and central Mexico.

'How irresponsible and careless of him just to get onto a flight knowing that he might be infected,' said Jesus Ortega, a former leader of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and one-time ally of the president.

'The problem is he's the president. If the president violates the health guidelines, he's setting a bad example to others,' said Ortega, wishing Lopez Obrador a quick recovery.

The government said Lopez Obrador's symptoms began on Sunday, but it was not clear exactly when. The president announced his positive test result 6 1/2 hours after the plane from the central city of San Luis Potosi reached the capital.

2021-01-25 23:59:06+00:00,8,"Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Sunday he has tested positive for COVID-19 and that the symptoms are mild.

Mexico's president, who has been criticized for his handling of his country's pandemic and for not setting an example of prevention in public, said on his official Twitter account that he is under medical treatment.

'I regret to inform you that I am infected with COVID-19,' he tweeted. 'The symptoms are mild but I am already under medical treatment. As always, I am optimistic. We will all move forward.'

José Luis Alomía Zegarra, Mexico's director of epidemiology, said López Obrador had a 'light' case of COVID-19 and was 'isolating at home.'

Mexico's president wrote that while he recovered Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez Cordero would be taking over for him in his daily news conferences, at which he usually speaks for two hours without breaks each weekday.

López Obrador, 67, has rarely been seen wearing a mask and continued to keep up a busy travel schedule taking commercial flights.

He has also resisted locking down the economy, noting the devastating effect it would have on so many Mexicans who live day to day, despite that the country has registered nearly 150,000 COVID-19 deaths and more than 1.7 million infections. Last week, the country registered its highest levels of infections and deaths to date.

Early in the pandemic, asked how he was protecting Mexico, López Obrador removed two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off.

'The protective shield is the `Get thee behind me, Satan,´' López Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, 'Stop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me.

In November, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, urged Mexico's leaders be serious about the coronavirus and set examples for its citizens, saying that 'Mexico is in bad shape' with the pandemic.

He didn´t name López Obrador, but said: 'We would like to ask Mexico to be very serious.'

'We have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples,' he added.

At the start of the pandemic López Obrador was criticized for still leaning into crowds and giving hugs. The eternal campaigner, López Obrador´s style of politics has always been very hands on and personal. As the pandemic grew he began limiting attendance to his events and maintaining his distance from supporters.

Despite his age and high blood pressure, as well as undergoing surgery after a heart attack, López Obrador has said he won´t jump the line for a vaccination. But he was getting tested for the coronavirus once a week.

At his age and with his existing health conditions López Obrador´s turn for a vaccine could still be weeks away as the country still works to vaccinate front line health workers.

As of Sunday night, Mexico had given nearly 630,000 doses of vaccine.

López Obrador's announcement came shortly after news emerged that he would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday about obtaining doses of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.

Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said via Twitter the two leaders would speak about the bilateral relationship and supplying doses of the vaccine.

The vaccine has not been approved for use in Mexico, but the government is desperate to fill supply gaps for the Pfizer vaccine.

There were some leftover doses that would have been thrown away if not used.

'They offered me a vaccination so I don't put people at risk while continuing to volunteer,' he told a newspaper.

Boris Johnson's spokesman said the Prime Minister was not aware of the circumstances of the case but that, in general, spare vaccines should be given to the most vulnerable.

'We have asked providers to have back-up lists of patients and staff in the [priority groups], so it's ready to give them if there are any vaccines available at short notice,' he said.

The first four groups to get the vaccine are meant to be older care home residents and carers; those over 80 and frontline health and social care workers; people over 75; those over 70 and people seen as very clinically vulnerable.

In his Facebook post, Mr Clarke-Smith wrote: 'As a volunteer I was also asked to have a vaccine.

The pet kitten was tested along with its mother and sibling when the cats were being transferred to an animal shelter.

Cats with Covid have been reported in Britain, Brazil and Japan, while a dog died in Hong Kong last year after testing positive for the virus.

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun (pictured during a press conference last week) on Sunday ordered health officials to 'scientifically evaluate the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 between humans and animals and keep the public well informed.'

Cats and COVID-19: Q&A How do cats catch coronavirus? Cats become infected in the same way as humans do, by inhaling infected droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes. There have been a handful of cases around the world and almost all appear to have caught it off their owners. Luckily, animals are far less susceptible to infection. The biggest cat to fall victim is Nadia, a four-year-old Malayan tiger at New York's Bronx Zoo. She made a full recovery. Could dogs and other animals get it too? Yes, there have been cases in dogs and other pets around the world. Some animals are particularly susceptible. Hundreds of thousands of minks have been slaughtered on farms in Spain and the Netherlands following outbreaks. Can humans catch Covid from infected pets? There is no evidence that animals transmit it to humans, with research suggesting they do not 'shed' enough virus to be infectious. However, Government scientists have warned that animals could act as 'fomites', in the same way as surfaces such as door handles do. For example, if an infected person coughed on their dog, the virus could survive on its fur and be passed to another person when they stroke it. What about animals spreading it to each other? There is evidence that cats can spread coronavirus to other cats. In May, researchers at the University of Wisconsin conducted an experiment when they infected three cats with the virus, then put three Covid-free felines in with them. The three newcomers went on to test positive after catching it from the infected animals. How bad are the symptoms of the virus in cats? Covid-19 seems to be far less deadly in animals than in humans. The British cat who tested positive showed mild clinical symptoms, but made a full recovery.

Public Health England has urged pet owners to wash their hands before and after contact with animals. The British Veterinary Association advises infected people to restrict contact with animals. Owners who test positive should also keep cats indoors if possible. Should I put a mask on my cat or dog? No! Dr Jenny Stavisky, of the University of Nottingham School of Veterinary Medicine, explains: 'They are likely to find it scary. It may, however, be a good idea to try to acclimatise your pet gently to seeing people wearing masks so they don't get frightened.' Advertisement

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Sunday ordered health officials to 'scientifically evaluate the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 between humans and animals and keep the public well informed.'

South Korea is a pet-loving nation with around a third of its 50 million people keeping animals in their homes.

In July, health officials in England revealed that a cat and its owners had tested positive for coronavirus.

The animal suffered from a runny nose and shortness of breath but made a full recovery along with the owners, Downing Street said.

At the time experts warned against cuddling pets and last night a group of scientists in Britain and the United States argued that cats and dogs could require vaccines.

Researchers from the University of East Anglia, the Earlham Institute in Norwich and the University of Minnesota said that transmission from animals to humans poses a 'significant long-term risk.'

'It is not unthinkable that vaccination of some domesticated animal species might ... be necessary to curb the spread of the infection,' they wrote.

In Denmark last year, hundreds of Covid-19 cases were caused by variants associated with farmed mink, leading to millions of the animals being culled.

One of the authors, Cock van Oosterhout, professor of evolutionary genetics at UEA, said: 'It makes sense to develop vaccines for pets ... We really need to be prepared for any eventuality.'

He pointed out that Russia has started to develop a vaccine for pets.

Kevin Tyler, editor-in-chief of Virulence, said: 'Cats are asymptomatic but they are infected by it and they can infect humans with it.

'The risk is that, as long as there are these reservoirs, that it starts to pass as it did in the mink from animal to animal, and then starts to evolve animal-specific strains, but then they spill back into the human population and you end up essentially with a new virus which is related which causes the whole thing all over again.'

He said that while mink were culled in Denmark, 'if you were thinking about domestic animals, companion animals, then you might think about whether you could vaccinate to stop that from happening'.

He added: 'It's not an obvious risk yet.'

In their editorial, the scientists wrote: 'Continued virus evolution in reservoir animal hosts, followed by spillback events into susceptible human hosts, poses a significant long-term risk to public health.

'SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide range of host species, including cats, dogs, mink and other wild and domesticated species and, hence, the vaccination of domesticated animals might be required to halt further virus evolution and spillback events.

'Whilst the vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2/ Covid-19 are being rolled out worldwide, new virus variants are likely to continue to evolve that have the potential to sweep through the human population.'

They said that more transmissible virus strains, such as the UK variant, require more people to be vaccinated to keep coronavirus under control.

'Vaccination against a viral pathogen with such high prevalence globally is without precedent and we, therefore, have found ourselves in uncharted waters,' they wrote.

The scientists have called on governments to consider the continued use of strict control measures such as masks and social distancing as the only way to reduce the evolution and spread of new Covid-19 variants.",MailOnline,"['south', 'kitten', 'animals', 'tested', 'infected', 'korea', 'cats', 'animal', 'virus', 'positive', 'covid19', 'pet', 'humans']",0
2021-01-25 19:50:19+00:00,28,"Cigarette smokers face a much higher risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 compared to those who have never smoked, a new study suggests.

Researchers found that all smokers had higher odds of poor outcomes due to the virus, but those at the highest risk were heavy smokers, defined as those smoking at least one pack per day for more than 30 years.

These patients had nearly double the risk of death due to COVID-19 and were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized because of the disease.

The team, from the Cleveland Clinic, says its findings are the most complete evidence to date of a cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and an elevated risk of severe illness and death.

It comes as health officials in states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania have prioritized smokers in the lines to received the COVID-19 vaccine.

A new study from the Cleveland Clinic found that patients smoking one pack per day for more than 30 years (far right) were more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 than those who had never smoked before (far left)

Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic looked at more than 7,000 coronavirus patients, including more than 6,000 never-smokers and the rest being current or former smokers (file image)

Research linking smoking status with severe COVID-19 infection and death has been limited and contradictory.

Early last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that cigarettes can increase the risk of contracting the disease.

'People who smoke cigarettes may be at increased risk of infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, and may have worse outcomes from COVID-19,' the agency said in a statement.

The FDA has previously warned about 'worse outcomes' for coronavirus among smokers but did not specify what that meant.

In addition, a French study found that only 4.4 percent of 350 coronavirus patients hospitalized were regular smokers and theorized that nicotine could prevent the virus from infecting cells.

For the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, the team examined data for all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 within the Cleveland Clinic Health system in Ohio and Florida between March 8, 2020 and August 25, 2020.

Patients smoking for more than 30 years were 1.9 times more likely to die from the virus than those who had never smoked before. Pictured: Chaplain Kevin Deegan places his hand on the head of a COVID-19 patient while praying for him at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Los Angeles, January 9, 2021

The study also found people smoking for zero to 10 years had a 1.6 times higher odds of death and people smoking for 10 to 30 years had a 1.5 times greater risk of death than never-smokers.

Of the 7,102 patients, the majority - 84.8 percent or 6,020 - had never smoked before.

Nearly 13 percent were former smokers and about 2.4 percent were current smokers.

A total of 341 were or had been smoking one pack per day between zero and 10 years, 400 had been doing so for 10 to 30 years, and 341 smoked one pack per day for more than 30 years.

Results showed that the longer patients had been smoking for, the higher their risks were for hospitalization and death.

Patients who had been smoking at least one pack per day for between 10 and 30 years were nearly 1.5 times more likely to be hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 than patients who were never-smokers.

Interestingly, although negligible, the risk of death was slightly higher among patients smoking for less than 10 years, who had a 1.6 times higher odds of dying than people who have never smoked.

Those consuming one pack per day for more than 30 years were 2.25 times more likely to be hospitalized from the disease.

Both also had about 1.5 times higher odds of being admitted to the ICU.

When it came to risk of death, people smoking for zero to 10 years had a 1.6 times higher odds of death, people smoking for 10 to 30 years had a 1.5 times greater risk of death than never-smokers.

For those smoking at least a pack per day for more than 30 years, patients were 1.9 times likely to die.

The team said there was no difference in the risk of hospital admission and death between current and former smokers.

2021-01-25 16:00:05+00:00,10,"China has been spreading doubts about the safety of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and suggested that the virus originated in an American military laboratory.

Beijing's cynical propaganda campaign comes after the recent arrival of World Health Organisation investigators in Wuhan to probe the origins of coronavirus.

As the Pfizer jab is rolled out across the world, the Chinese Communist has filled the airwaves with stories about people dying suddenly after having the US drug company's vaccine.

On social media, the hashtag 'American's Ft. Detrick,' started by the Communist Youth League, was viewed 1.4 billion times in the last week after Beijing called for a WHO probe into the biological weapons lab in Maryland.

Beijing's claim follows an intelligence dump from Washington this month which said workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill with 'symptoms consistent with COVID-19' in the fall of 2019.

China's president Xi Jinping addresses the fifth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) in Beijing, capital of China on January 22

Chinese scientists and officials have been eager to find 'evidence' the virus started overseas and have blamed a total of nine countries for being the true source - despite experts rubbishing those theories

The Trump administration pressed the WHO to fully investigate the laboratory, saying that the Chinese had withheld vital information about the virus since the first outbreak.

While China's fringe theories may raise eyebrows abroad, they have a captive domestic audience.

'It's purpose is to shift the blame from mishandling by (the) Chinese government in the pandemic's early days to conspiracy by the U.S.,' said Fang Shimin, a now-U.S.-based writer known for exposing faked degrees and other fraud in Chinese science. 'The tactic is quite successful because of widespread anti-American sentiment in China.'

Yuan Zeng, an expert on Chinese media at the University of Leeds in Great Britain, said the government's stories spread so widely that even well-educated Chinese friends have asked her whether they might be true.

Inflaming doubts and spreading conspiracy theories might add to public health risks as governments try to dispel unease about vaccines, she said, saying: 'That is super, super dangerous.'

In the latest volley, state media called for an investigation into the deaths of 23 elderly people in Norway after they received the Pfizer vaccine. An anchor at CGTN, the English-language station of state broadcaster CCTV, and the Global Times newspaper accused Western media of ignoring the news.

Health experts say deaths unrelated to the vaccine are possible during mass vaccination campaigns, and a WHO panel has concluded that the vaccine did not play a 'contributory role' in the Norway deaths.

The state media coverage followed a report by researchers in Brazil who found the effectiveness of a Chinese vaccine lower than previously announced. Researchers initially said Sinovac's vaccine is 78% effective, but the scientists revised that to 50.4% after including mildly symptomatic cases.

After the Brazil news, researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a government-supported think tank, reported seeing an increase in Chinese media disinformation about vaccines.

Dozens of online articles on popular health and science blogs and elsewhere have explored questions about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine at length, drawing on an op-ed published this month in the British Medical Journal that raised questions about its clinical trial data.

While China enjoys its Covid recovery and trumpets its success, a growing body of evidence suggests it covered up the early spread of the disease - allowing it to balloon into a pandemic while robbing other nations of the ability to properly respond

China's GDP grew by 2.3 per cent in 2020, making it the only major economy likely to record economic growth in the year of the pandemic

'It's very embarrassing' for the government, Fang said in an email. As a result, China is trying to raise doubts about the Pfizer vaccine to save face and promote its vaccines, he said.

Senior Chinese government officials have not been shy in voicing concerns about the mRNA vaccines developed by Western drug companies. They use a newer technology than the more traditional approach of the Chinese vaccines currently in use.

In December, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, Gao Fu, said he can't rule out negative side effects from the mRNA vaccines. Noting this is the first time they are being given to healthy people, he said, 'there are safety concerns.'

The arrival of the WHO mission has brought back persistent criticism that China allowed the virus to spread globally by reacting too slowly in the beginning, even reprimanding doctors who tried to warn the public. The visiting researchers will begin field work this week after being released from a 14-day quarantine.

The Communist Party sees the WHO investigation as a political risk because it focuses attention on China's response, said Jacob Wallis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

The party wants to 'distract domestic and international audiences by pre-emptively distorting the narrative on where responsibility lies for the emergence of COVID-19,' Wallis said.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying got the ball rolling last week by calling for the WHO investigation of the U.S. military lab. The site had been mentioned previously by CGTN and other state-controlled outlets.

'If America respects the truth, then please open up Ft. Detrick and make public more information about the 200 or more bio-labs outside of the U.S., and please allow the WHO expert group to go to the U.S. to investigate the origins,' Hua said.

Her comments, publicized by state media, became one of the most popular topics on Sina Weibo.

China isn't the only government to point fingers.

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Sunday ordered health officials to 'scientifically evaluate the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 between humans and animals and keep the public well informed.'

South Korea is a pet-loving nation with around a third of its 50 million people keeping animals in their homes.

In July, health officials in England revealed that a cat and its owners had tested positive for coronavirus.

The animal suffered from a runny nose and shortness of breath but made a full recovery along with the owners, Downing Street said.

At the time experts warned against cuddling pets and last night a group of scientists in Britain and the United States argued that cats and dogs could require vaccines.

Researchers from the University of East Anglia, the Earlham Institute in Norwich and the University of Minnesota said that transmission from animals to humans poses a 'significant long-term risk.'

'It is not unthinkable that vaccination of some domesticated animal species might ... be necessary to curb the spread of the infection,' they wrote.

In Denmark last year, hundreds of Covid-19 cases were caused by variants associated with farmed mink, leading to millions of the animals being culled.

One of the authors, Cock van Oosterhout, professor of evolutionary genetics at UEA, said: 'It makes sense to develop vaccines for pets ... We really need to be prepared for any eventuality.'

He pointed out that Russia has started to develop a vaccine for pets.

Kevin Tyler, editor-in-chief of Virulence, said: 'Cats are asymptomatic but they are infected by it and they can infect humans with it.

'The risk is that, as long as there are these reservoirs, that it starts to pass as it did in the mink from animal to animal, and then starts to evolve animal-specific strains, but then they spill back into the human population and you end up essentially with a new virus which is related which causes the whole thing all over again.'

He said that while mink were culled in Denmark, 'if you were thinking about domestic animals, companion animals, then you might think about whether you could vaccinate to stop that from happening'.

He added: 'It's not an obvious risk yet.'

In their editorial, the scientists wrote: 'Continued virus evolution in reservoir animal hosts, followed by spillback events into susceptible human hosts, poses a significant long-term risk to public health.

'SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide range of host species, including cats, dogs, mink and other wild and domesticated species and, hence, the vaccination of domesticated animals might be required to halt further virus evolution and spillback events.

'Whilst the vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2/ Covid-19 are being rolled out worldwide, new virus variants are likely to continue to evolve that have the potential to sweep through the human population.'

They said that more transmissible virus strains, such as the UK variant, require more people to be vaccinated to keep coronavirus under control.

'Vaccination against a viral pathogen with such high prevalence globally is without precedent and we, therefore, have found ourselves in uncharted waters,' they wrote.

2021-01-25 13:19:07+00:00,24,"China has been spreading doubts about the safety of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and suggested that the virus originated in an American military laboratory.

Beijing's cynical propaganda campaign comes after the recent arrival of World Health Organisation investigators in Wuhan to probe the origins of coronavirus.

As the Pfizer jab is rolled out across the world, the Chinese Communist has filled the airwaves with stories about people dying suddenly after having the US drug company's vaccine.

On social media, the hashtag 'American's Ft. Detrick,' started by the Communist Youth League, was viewed 1.4 billion times in the last week after Beijing called for a WHO probe into the biological weapons lab in Maryland.

Beijing's claim follows an intelligence dump from Washington this month which said workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill with 'symptoms consistent with COVID-19' in the fall of 2019.

Chinese scientists and officials have been eager to find 'evidence' the virus started overseas and have blamed a total of nine countries for being the true source - despite experts rubbishing those theories

The Trump administration pressed the WHO to fully investigate the laboratory, saying that the Chinese had withheld vital information about the virus since the first outbreak.

While China's fringe theories may raise eyebrows abroad, they have a captive domestic audience.

'It's purpose is to shift the blame from mishandling by (the) Chinese government in the pandemic's early days to conspiracy by the U.S.,' said Fang Shimin, a now-U.S.-based writer known for exposing faked degrees and other fraud in Chinese science. 'The tactic is quite successful because of widespread anti-American sentiment in China.'

Yuan Zeng, an expert on Chinese media at the University of Leeds in Great Britain, said the government's stories spread so widely that even well-educated Chinese friends have asked her whether they might be true.

Inflaming doubts and spreading conspiracy theories might add to public health risks as governments try to dispel unease about vaccines, she said, saying: 'That is super, super dangerous.'

In the latest volley, state media called for an investigation into the deaths of 23 elderly people in Norway after they received the Pfizer vaccine. An anchor at CGTN, the English-language station of state broadcaster CCTV, and the Global Times newspaper accused Western media of ignoring the news.

Health experts say deaths unrelated to the vaccine are possible during mass vaccination campaigns, and a WHO panel has concluded that the vaccine did not play a 'contributory role' in the Norway deaths.

The state media coverage followed a report by researchers in Brazil who found the effectiveness of a Chinese vaccine lower than previously announced. Researchers initially said Sinovac's vaccine is 78% effective, but the scientists revised that to 50.4% after including mildly symptomatic cases.

After the Brazil news, researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a government-supported think tank, reported seeing an increase in Chinese media disinformation about vaccines.

Dozens of online articles on popular health and science blogs and elsewhere have explored questions about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine at length, drawing on an op-ed published this month in the British Medical Journal that raised questions about its clinical trial data.

While China enjoys its Covid recovery and trumpets its success, a growing body of evidence suggests it covered up the early spread of the disease - allowing it to balloon into a pandemic while robbing other nations of the ability to properly respond

China's GDP grew by 2.3 per cent in 2020, making it the only major economy likely to record economic growth in the year of the pandemic

'It's very embarrassing' for the government, Fang said in an email. As a result, China is trying to raise doubts about the Pfizer vaccine to save face and promote its vaccines, he said.

Senior Chinese government officials have not been shy in voicing concerns about the mRNA vaccines developed by Western drug companies. They use a newer technology than the more traditional approach of the Chinese vaccines currently in use.

In December, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, Gao Fu, said he can't rule out negative side effects from the mRNA vaccines. Noting this is the first time they are being given to healthy people, he said, 'there are safety concerns.'

The arrival of the WHO mission has brought back persistent criticism that China allowed the virus to spread globally by reacting too slowly in the beginning, even reprimanding doctors who tried to warn the public. The visiting researchers will begin field work this week after being released from a 14-day quarantine.

The Communist Party sees the WHO investigation as a political risk because it focuses attention on China's response, said Jacob Wallis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

The party wants to 'distract domestic and international audiences by pre-emptively distorting the narrative on where responsibility lies for the emergence of COVID-19,' Wallis said.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying got the ball rolling last week by calling for the WHO investigation of the U.S. military lab. The site had been mentioned previously by CGTN and other state-controlled outlets.

'If America respects the truth, then please open up Ft. Detrick and make public more information about the 200 or more bio-labs outside of the U.S., and please allow the WHO expert group to go to the U.S. to investigate the origins,' Hua said.

Her comments, publicized by state media, became one of the most popular topics on Sina Weibo.

The pet kitten was tested along with its mother and sibling when the cats were being transferred to an animal shelter.

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun (pictured during a press conference last week) on Sunday ordered health officials to 'scientifically evaluate the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 between humans and animals and keep the public well informed.'

Cats and COVID-19: Q&A How do cats catch coronavirus? Cats become infected in the same way as humans do, by inhaling infected droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes. There have been a handful of cases around the world and almost all appear to have caught it off their owners. Luckily, animals are far less susceptible to infection. The biggest cat to fall victim is Nadia, a four-year-old Malayan tiger at New York's Bronx Zoo. She made a full recovery. Could dogs and other animals get it too? Yes, there have been cases in dogs and other pets around the world. Some animals are particularly susceptible. Hundreds of thousands of minks have been slaughtered on farms in Spain and the Netherlands following outbreaks. Can humans catch Covid from infected pets? There is no evidence that animals transmit it to humans, with research suggesting they do not 'shed' enough virus to be infectious. However, Government scientists have warned that animals could act as 'fomites', in the same way as surfaces such as door handles do. For example, if an infected person coughed on their dog, the virus could survive on its fur and be passed to another person when they stroke it. What about animals spreading it to each other? There is evidence that cats can spread coronavirus to other cats. In May, researchers at the University of Wisconsin conducted an experiment when they infected three cats with the virus, then put three Covid-free felines in with them. The three newcomers went on to test positive after catching it from the infected animals. How bad are the symptoms of the virus in cats? Covid-19 seems to be far less deadly in animals than in humans. The British cat who tested positive showed mild clinical symptoms, but made a full recovery. Many other felines which have tested positive displayed no symptoms at all. I have tested positive – how can I protect my pet? Public Health England has urged pet owners to wash their hands before and after contact with animals. The British Veterinary Association advises infected people to restrict contact with animals.

José Luis Alomía Zegarra, Mexico's director of epidemiology, said López Obrador had a 'light' case of COVID-19 and was 'isolating at home.'

Mexico's president wrote that while he recovered Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez Cordero would be taking over for him in his daily news conferences, at which he usually speaks for two hours without breaks each weekday.

López Obrador, 67, has rarely been seen wearing a mask and continued to keep up a busy travel schedule taking commercial flights.

He has also resisted locking down the economy, noting the devastating effect it would have on so many Mexicans who live day to day, despite that the country has registered nearly 150,000 COVID-19 deaths and more than 1.7 million infections. Last week, the country registered its highest levels of infections and deaths to date.

Early in the pandemic, asked how he was protecting Mexico, López Obrador removed two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off.

'The protective shield is the `Get thee behind me, Satan,´' López Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, 'Stop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me.

In November, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, urged Mexico's leaders be serious about the coronavirus and set examples for its citizens, saying that 'Mexico is in bad shape' with the pandemic.

He didn´t name López Obrador, but said: 'We would like to ask Mexico to be very serious.'

'We have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples,' he added.

At the start of the pandemic López Obrador was criticized for still leaning into crowds and giving hugs. The eternal campaigner, López Obrador´s style of politics has always been very hands on and personal. As the pandemic grew he began limiting attendance to his events and maintaining his distance from supporters.

Despite his age and high blood pressure, as well as undergoing surgery after a heart attack, López Obrador has said he won´t jump the line for a vaccination. But he was getting tested for the coronavirus once a week.

At his age and with his existing health conditions López Obrador´s turn for a vaccine could still be weeks away as the country still works to vaccinate front line health workers.

As of Sunday night, Mexico had given nearly 630,000 doses of vaccine.

López Obrador's announcement came shortly after news emerged that he would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday about obtaining doses of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.

Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said via Twitter the two leaders would speak about the bilateral relationship and supplying doses of the vaccine.

The vaccine has not been approved for use in Mexico, but the government is desperate to fill supply gaps for the Pfizer vaccine.

He has been criticized for his handling of his country's pandemic and for not setting an example of prevention in public by not wearing a face mask

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted on Sunday that he had mild symptoms, and is optimistic about his treatment

He has also resisted locking down the economy, noting the devastating effect it would have on so many Mexicans who live day to day, despite that the country has registered nearly 150,000 COVID-19 deaths and more than 1.7 million infections. Last week, the country registered its highest levels of infections and deaths to date.

Early in the pandemic, asked how he was protecting Mexico, López Obrador removed two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off.

'The protective shield is the `Get thee behind me, Satan,´' López Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, 'Stop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me.

In November, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, urged Mexico's leaders be serious about the coronavirus and set examples for its citizens, saying that 'Mexico is in bad shape' with the pandemic.

He didn´t name López Obrador, but said: 'We would like to ask Mexico to be very serious.'

'We have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples,' he added.

At the start of the pandemic López Obrador was criticized for still leaning into crowds and giving hugs. The eternal campaigner, López Obrador´s style of politics has always been very hands on and personal. As the pandemic grew he began limiting attendance to his events and maintaining his distance from supporters.

Despite his age and high blood pressure, as well as undergoing surgery after a heart attack, López Obrador has said he won´t jump the line for a vaccination. But he was getting tested for the coronavirus once a week.

At his age and with his existing health conditions López Obrador´s turn for a vaccine could still be weeks away as the country still works to vaccinate front line health workers.

As of Sunday night, Mexico had given nearly 630,000 doses of vaccine.

López Obrador's announcement came shortly after news emerged that he would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday about obtaining doses of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.

Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said via Twitter the two leaders would speak about the bilateral relationship and supplying doses of the vaccine.

The vaccine has not been approved for use in Mexico, but the government is desperate to fill supply gaps for the Pfizer vaccine.

Besides López Obrador, other Latin American leaders who have tested positive for the coronavirus are Brazil´s President Jair Bolsonaro, Guatemala´s Alejandro Giammattei, Honduras´ Juan Orlando Hernández and Bolivia´s then-interim President Jeanine Ánéz.

They said that transmission from animals to humans poses a 'significant long-term risk' because domesticated species can become infected and the virus continuously evolves in them as well.

'It is not unthinkable that vaccination of some domesticated animal species might ... be necessary to curb the spread of the infection,' the experts from the University of East Anglia, the Earlham Institute in Norwich and the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial for the journal Virulence.

In Denmark last year, hundreds of Covid-19 cases were caused by variants associated with farmed mink, leading to millions of the animals being culled.

One of the authors, Cock van Oosterhout, professor of evolutionary genetics at UEA, said: 'It makes sense to develop vaccines for pets ... We really need to be prepared for any eventuality.'

He pointed out that Russia has started to develop a vaccine for pets.

Cats and dogs could have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in future, a group of scientists has said. Pictured: A dog receives a vaccination in Moscow, Russia, where scientists have started developing Covid-19 jabs for pets

Kevin Tyler, editor-in-chief of Virulence, said: 'Cats are asymptomatic but they are infected by it and they can infect humans with it.

'The risk is that, as long as there are these reservoirs, that it starts to pass as it did in the mink from animal to animal, and then starts to evolve animal-specific strains, but then they spill back into the human population and you end up essentially with a new virus which is related which causes the whole thing all over again.'

He said that while mink were culled in Denmark, 'if you were thinking about domestic animals, companion animals, then you might think about whether you could vaccinate to stop that from happening'.

He added: 'It's not an obvious risk yet.'

A Daily Mail cartoon by Pugh

In their editorial, the scientists wrote: 'Continued virus evolution in reservoir animal hosts, followed by spillback events into susceptible human hosts, poses a significant long-term risk to public health.

'SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide range of host species, including cats, dogs, mink and other wild and domesticated species and, hence, the vaccination of domesticated animals might be required to halt further virus evolution and spillback events.

'Whilst the vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2/ Covid-19 are being rolled out worldwide, new virus variants are likely to continue to evolve that have the potential to sweep through the human population.'

They said that more transmissible virus strains, such as the UK variant, require more people to be vaccinated to keep coronavirus under control.

'Vaccination against a viral pathogen with such high prevalence globally is without precedent and we, therefore, have found ourselves in uncharted waters,' they wrote.

The scientists have called on governments to consider the continued use of strict control measures such as masks and social distancing as the only way to reduce the evolution and spread of new Covid-19 variants.",MailOnline,"['poses', 'species', 'animals', 'scientists', 'pets', 'transmission', 'longterm', 'mink', 'domesticated', 'animal', 'virus', 'covid19', 'say', 'significant', 'humans', 'risk', 'vaccination']",0

A veteran of more than 1,400 films and TV commercials as an actor or stunt coordinator, Julienne had been in intensive care in a hospital in his home town of Montargis in central France since early January.

'What was bound to happen has happened. He left us early in the evening (Thursday). It was predictable, he was on a respirator,' a relative told AFP.

Veteran stunt driver Remy Julienne, pictured, has died from Covid-19 aged 90. The legend worked on six James Bond movies and was involved in more than 1,400 movies and TV commercials since the 1960s

One of his most memorable stunts - which made his name in the industry - was this jump across and alleyway between two buildings in the Italian Job

He also arranged this amazing stunt on the 1981 James Bond movie For Your Eyes Only

Julienne was born in Cepoy near Montargis in 1930.

A French motocross champion, he began his film career in 1964 when he doubled for French actor Jean Marais in the film 'Fantomas', in which he was required to ride a motorbike.

'They needed someone who was very controlled,' he said of this experience. 'It ended up being me. It was the start of a huge adventure.'

His career saw him fly over Venice dangling from a rope-ladder suspended from a helicopter, being hit in the face with a pumpkin while riding a motorbike and countless car crashes.

He doubled for some of the world's most famous actors, including Sean Connery and Roger Moore, as well top French names including Yves Montand, Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo.

He worked on six James Bond movies in total, including 'GoldenEye' and 'For Your Eyes Only', in which he drove a heavily modified yellow Citroen 2CV during a memorable car chase.

Both as an actor and a director of stunt sequences, which became the focus of his later career, Julienne won praise from some of the biggest names in cinema for his precision and creativity.

In 1989's Licence To Kill, he arranged this stunt involving the destruction of a petrol tanker. Julienne was renowned for his believe that the stunts had to be real and not dominated by CGI

'He has an absolutely incredible scientific understanding. He's a real scientist, the Einstein of stuntmen,' French director Claude Lelouch told a documentary for France Televisions marking Julienne's 50 years in the business.

A believer in real action rather than special effects, Julienne worked constantly to minimise the risks he took during his shoots, but he badly injured himself early in his career while filming on a Colombian production in Germany.

Missing his timing to exit from a car before it crashed into a ravine, he ended up with a crushed ankle that left him in bed for six weeks.

Once recovered, he would go on to earn fame from his work for the car chase scenes in the 'The Italian Job' with Michael Caine.

'Fear is necessary before and after, but never during,' he once said of his time on film sets.

His career low point came during filming for the French film 'Taxi 2' in 1999, which he was overseeing, when a cameraman was killed by a car that missed its landing spot after a jump.

Discussing his dangerous job, Julienne once admitted that fear was okay both before and after a stunt but never during

He was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2007 and handed an 18-month suspended jail sentence, which was later reduced on appeal to six months and an order to pay damages of €60,000 to the victim's family.

Julienne also helped police with crime reconstructions.

In 2000, he mounted a reconstruction of the death of a British student, Isabel Peake, to try to establish how the young woman was pushed from a Paris-bound train.

2021-01-23 17:51:21+00:00,41,"A gang of more than 100 monkeys has raided a farm to steal food in Thailand after a lack of tourists due to Covid-19 cut off their regular food supply.

Video footage shows adult and baby monkeys - which are normally fed by tourists - racing to grab chunks of corn to eat in Nakhon Ratchasima province on January 18.

The villagers could only watch from afar as the creatures ravaged their crops.

One of the farmers said he did not dare to stop the animals as they were too many and could become aggressive.

A gang of more than 100 monkeys raided a farm on Tuesday to steal food in Thailand after a lack of tourists due to Covid-19 cut off their food supply. Pictured: The monkeys run across a road, captured in video footage of the gang moving towards the farm

He said: 'It would be impossible to stop all of them and dangerous, too. One monkey is enough to harm people if it wants too.

'Imagine having to stop more than a hundred hungry monkeys. So we just let them eat the crops.'

As the farm is close to the national park, other animals such as elephants, cattle, and bulls, have raided the area before to search for food.

The monkey gang emerged from the Khao Phaeng Ma Non-Hunting Area and Khao Yai National Park where they lived.

Recorded from inside a car, the footage showed the driver slowly creeping up the dusty road as monkeys ran across in front the vehicle.

Panning to the right of the car, the person filming showed a number of other monkeys hiding among the foliage, before chasing after the rest of the gang.

One of the farmers said he did not dare to stop the animals as they were too many and could become aggressive. The monkey gang emerged from the Khao Phaeng Ma Non-Hunting Area and Khao Yai National Park where they lived

Tourism has plummeted in Thailand, leaving the monkeys without a consistent source of food. In Q2 and Q3 of 2020, virtually no tourists arrived in Thailand, with the latest available figures from the Thai Ministry of Tourism showing just 3,065 tourists arrived from abroad in November

They used to be fed with snacks by tourists but due to the pandemic, there were fewer visitors to give them food.

Some of the animals have also taken over the road appearing to move to the next place while carrying their babies when they have finished eating corn.

The devastated farmers sought help from local government agencies so they can be compensated for the crops and prevent the incident from happening again.

The first quarter of 2020 saw tourist arrivals in Thailand drop to 6.7 million people, down from 10.7 million from the first quarter of the previous year, as the coronavirus pandemic began to sweep the globe and limit the number of people travelling.

In March 2020, just 800,000 came to Thailand, compared to 3.4 million in 2019, with the country closing its borders to tourists for the month of April.

In Q2 and Q3 of 2020, virtually no tourists arrived in Thailand, with the latest available figures from the Thai Ministry of Tourism showing just 3,065 tourists arrived from abroad in November 2020.

In July last year, it was reported that the city of Lopburi, around 30 miles west of edge of Nakhon Ratchasima province, had been overrun by macaques.

Lopburi is home to some 8,400 macaques which were a major tourist draw before lockdown stopped visitors from coming. However, without food, they became a menace to the locals

Residents of Lopburi said that without tourists to feed the monkeys, they turned violent, attacking people and each-other in an increasingly desperate search for food

A lack of tourists and a consistent source of food led to the monkeys becoming aggressive, with as many as 8,400 overrunning the city and forcing locals to avoid going outside where possible.

Local vets were even forced to sterilise some the monkeys to try and keep their numbers down, with police admitting they were powerless to do anything.

Before the coronavirus, the monkeys drew tourists to the city, with many purchasing fruit from local businesses to feed the monkeys for a photo opportunity.

2021-01-23 12:30:30+00:00,11,"A double-dip recession in the Eurozone is 'increasingly inevitable' due to Covid-19, with France among the countries most seriously hit, experts have warned.

The slowdown in Eurozone business activities intensified in January as the pandemic continued to batter the economy, a key survey showed on Friday.

The closely watched PMI index compiled by IHS Markit is considered the earliest indicator of the state of the economy and the latest reading confirmed fears that the year-old virus crisis is still going strong.

France was among the hardest hit Eurozone nations, according to the closely watched PMI index compiled by IHS Markit, amid concerns over the country's vaccination roll-out. Pictured: Metal barriers block the access to the pyramids of the closed Louvre museum in Paris

France was among the hardest hit Eurozone nations, with the news coming amid concerns over the country's vaccine roll-out being slower than others.

Much hope has been put in the distribution of vaccinations to reopen the economy but the campaign in the EU is going at a slower pace than hoped.

Meanwhile in Britain, that left the EU on January 1, the relapse into a third national lockdown has sparked the sharpest drop in business activity since May, with services companies hit hardest, according to the survey.

The series of damaging lockdowns have been largely due to the spread of a more contagious strain of the virus.

A preliminary 'flash' UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 40.6 in January, down from 50.4 in December, in the survey announced Friday.

However, Britain's vaccination programme has been rolled out at a much faster rate than countries on the continent, partly thanks to its ability to avoid European red tape since Brexit, that is holding others back.

In the UK, 8.01 vaccine doses have been administered per 100 people, as of January 22. In contrast, France has seen just 1.26, Germany 1.67 and Spain 2.36.

'A double-dip recession for the eurozone economy is looking increasingly inevitable as tighter Covid-19 restrictions took a further toll on businesses in January,' Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

This meant that the economies of the 19 countries that use the single currency, dominated by Germany and France, would sink back into recession after only a very short recovery over the European summer.

The firm's closely watched PMI index fell from 49.1 points in December to 47.5 points this month, further away from the 50-point level which indicates growth.

Williamson noted however that the bad start to 2021 would be less damaging than the economic collapse seen in the first wave of the pandemic last year.

This was due to the 'ongoing relative resilience of manufacturing, rising demand for exported goods and the lockdown measures having been less stringent on average than last year,' he said.

The difference between France and Germany was notable.

The near-empty Pariser Platz square in front of Berlin's landmark Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor) reflected in a shop window on January 22, 2021. Europe's top economy Germany this week extended its partial lockdown until February 14, 2021. A preliminary 'flash' UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 40.6 in January, down from 50.4

German exports managed to keep the country narrowly on a growth trajectory, while French business activity sank.

The situation for the rest of the eurozone, accounting for a little more than half of the bloc's economy, was even worse.

Worryingly, employment across the eurozone fell for an eleventh consecutive month, albeit with modest increases in France and Germany, IHS Markit said.

The bleak picture confirmed a warning by European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde who saw 'serious risks' still looming over the eurozone economy.

The rollout of vaccines had instilled 'a strong degree of confidence' but 'the recent rise in virus case numbers has caused some pull-back in optimism,' Williamson said.",MailOnline,"['increasingly', 'uk', 'inevitable', 'vaccination', 'markit', 'eurozone', 'eu', 'doubledip', 'france', 'germany', 'index', 'covid', 'pmi', 'economy', 'recession', 'european']",0
2021-01-23 06:00:05+00:00,101,"Dr Anthony Fauci has admitted he was 'knocked out' for a full day by his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

'I was hoping that I wouldn’t get too knocked out. I did for about 24 hours. Now I’m fine,' Dr Fauci said during a Thursday White House press briefing when asked if he'd had his booster shot.

The nation's top infectious disease doctor said he was 'fatigued. A little achy. You know. Chilly,' but 'no sick' after his second dose of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine.

Those are among the most common side effects of either of the two shots authorized in the US, made by Pfizer and Moderna.

But Dr Fauci continued to remind Americans that those side effects are not illness triggered by the vaccine, but the immune system ramping up to fend off the virus.

Dr Anthony Fauci said during a Thursday White House briefing that he was 'knocked out' for a full day by fatigue, chills and aches after getting his second dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine on January 19

Dr Fauci revealed he got his second dose of the vaccine on January 19.

It came 28 days after he received his first dose of the shot on December 22, on live television.

He joined the ranks of other officials and high-profile figures whose vaccinations were televised to encourage Americans to get theirs, including President Biden, former Vice President Pence and three former US presidents: Obama, Bush and Clinton.

Former President Trump, who had COVD-19 last fall, did not publicly get vaccinated. It is unclear whether he had the shot behind closed doors.

Americans' confidence in vaccines has improved since the summer, when only about half of US adults said they planned to get the shot.

By the end of December, that share had risen to 60 percent, according to Pew Research.

Vaccine hesitancy threatens to undermine the critical rollout of vaccines.

Despite the rise in confidence among the general public, health officials were taken aback when high rates of health care workers - who were given top priority for vaccination - refused the shot.

In Ohio, some 60 percent of health care workers turned down the vaccine initially. One Illinois veterans home said that 80 percent of its staff said 'no' to getting vaccinated.

Dr Fauci received his first dose of the vaccine on live television on December 22, in an effort to instill confidence in the shot in Americans

About 80 percent of people who got Moderna's vaccine in its trial had side effects after the second dose (top and bottom, fourth bar from left in both). Headache, fatigue, aches (myalgia) and chills were most common, suffered by more than 50% of participants (bottom)

Surveys showed that Americans' top concerns were that, despite published data from large trials, vaccines were developed too fast and might be unsafe or cause side effects some believed were worse than COVID-19 itself.

No deaths have been conclusively linked to either Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine.

About 55 percent of people who got Moderna's shot in its trial reported side effects after the first dose.

Eighty percent of participants who got the real vaccine had side effects after the second dose, so doctors warned Americans to be prepared to feel these.

Like Dr Fauci, about 70 percent of participants were fatigued after their second dose and more than half were achy or had chills.

Headaches were also a common side effect.

Anecdotally, dozens of Americans who said they took part in trials for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines came forward saying the second dose had left them with significant side effects, with some reporting being in bed for day or more or developing high fevers.

Since the rollout began, at least 20 cases of severe allergic reactions to Pfizer's vaccine have been documented.

This has been a lesser concern with Moderna's shot, although a batch of 330,000 doses was put on hold in California after seven health care workers there had reactions within 24 hours.

Since vaccinations began on December 14, 18.9 million doses of vaccine have been administered in the US.

Much hope has been put in the distribution of vaccinations to reopen the economy but the campaign in the EU is going at a slower pace than hoped.

Meanwhile in Britain, that left the EU on January 1, the relapse into a third national lockdown has sparked the sharpest drop in business activity since May, with services companies hit hardest, according to the survey.

The series of damaging lockdowns have been largely due to the spread of a more contagious strain of the virus.

A preliminary 'flash' UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 40.6 in January, down from 50.4 in December, in the survey announced Friday.

However, Britain's vaccination programme has been rolled out at a much faster rate than countries on the continent, partly thanks to its ability to avoid European red tape since Brexit, that is holding others back.

In the UK, 8.01 vaccine doses have been administered per 100 people, as of January 22. In contrast, France has seen just 1.26, Germany 1.67 and Spain 2.36.

'A double-dip recession for the eurozone economy is looking increasingly inevitable as tighter Covid-19 restrictions took a further toll on businesses in January,' Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

This meant that the economies of the 19 countries that use the single currency, dominated by Germany and France, would sink back into recession after only a very short recovery over the European summer.

The firm's closely watched PMI index fell from 49.1 points in December to 47.5 points this month, further away from the 50-point level which indicates growth.

Williamson noted however that the bad start to 2021 would be less damaging than the economic collapse seen in the first wave of the pandemic last year.

This was due to the 'ongoing relative resilience of manufacturing, rising demand for exported goods and the lockdown measures having been less stringent on average than last year,' he said.

The difference between France and Germany was notable.

German exports managed to keep the country narrowly on a growth trajectory, while French business activity sank.

The situation for the rest of the eurozone, accounting for a little more than half of the bloc's economy, was even worse.

Worryingly, employment across the eurozone fell for an eleventh consecutive month, albeit with modest increases in France and Germany, IHS Markit said.

The bleak picture confirmed a warning by European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde who saw 'serious risks' still looming over the eurozone economy.

The slowdown in Eurozone business activities intensified in January as the pandemic continued to batter the economy, a key survey showed on Friday.

The closely watched PMI index compiled by IHS Markit is considered the earliest indicator of the state of the economy and the latest reading confirmed fears that the year-old virus crisis is still going strong.

2021-01-22 10:35:23+00:00,10,"A Japanese mother who tested positive for the coronavirus has killed herself at her home after she felt sorry for causing trouble for her family, reports say.

The woman, aged in her 30s, was found dead last Friday in her Tokyo apartment where she was self-isolating after contracting Covid-19.

In a note she left behind, the parent wrote that ‘it is inexcusable that I have become a nuisance,’ and blamed herself for her daughter catching the virus.

A Japanese mother (not pictured) who tested positive for the coronavirus has killed herself at her home after she felt sorry for causing trouble for her family, reports say. In this file photo, a mask-donning woman walks near one of the Olympic venues in Tokyo on Wednesday

The Japanese woman lived with her husband and daughter who have both tested positive for the disease, according to local media citing sources.

Despite having no symptoms, the Japanese mother expressed her worries in her note that she may have passed her infection to people she knew.

She also said that she felt sorry for causing trouble for people around her.

'It is inexcusable that I have become a nuisance,' the woman wrote.

Health experts have called for necessary mental care for the people who self-isolate at home during the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than two million people worldwide.

Ueda Michiko, an associate professor studying suicide at Waseda University, told NHK that many people feel pressured when they get infected for the virus as they think that they might spread the virus or cause trouble for others.

‘There is also the fact that you are restricted from interacting with others, which may mentally drive you into a corner,’ Michiko said.

‘We need a system that understands how to care for them.’

The number of people taking their own lives in Japan rose for the first time in over a decade last year, as the pandemic reversed years of progress combatting a high suicide rate (file)

The news comes as the number of people taking their own lives in Japan has risen for the first time in over a decade last year, as the pandemic reversed years of progress combatting a stubbornly high suicide rate.

Japan's health and welfare ministry said Friday that 20,919 people died by suicide in 2020 according to preliminary data, up 3.7 per cent from the previous year. That compares with 3,460 deaths from coronavirus in the same period.

It marks the first year-on-year rise in suicides in more than a decade, with women and children, in particular, taking their lives at higher rates.

Japan has long had the highest suicide rate among the Group of Seven advanced countries -- though regionally South Korea registers higher figures. But the government has worked in recent years to better support people with mental health needs.

Japan has seen a smaller coronavirus outbreak than some countries, avoiding the harsh lockdown measures put in place elsewhere, and a fall in suicides during the first half of 2020 raised hopes that the pandemic's impact might be limited.

But the figures began to rise in July after a first state of emergency was lifted in May, a pattern experts say tracks with data showing suicides often drop in the first phase of crises such as conflicts and natural disasters, before rising sharply.

2021-01-20 18:40:08+00:00,3,"The biggest brothel in Bangkok is throwing in the towel to become a hotel after its business was devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The 11-storey 'Poseidon' massage parlour in Thailand’s capital boasted an in-house nightclub, restaurant and hundreds of luxury themed rooms filled with king-size beds and jacuzzis.

But the decor will now be ripped out and replaced as the building is turned into a three-star hotel, with guests being told nothing of its seedy past.

Girls wore different badges according to their desirability and prices for a couple of hours in a private room. Workers at the Thai brothel Poseidon are pictured waiting to be picked up

The Poseidon entertainment complex opened in 1999 was known as one of Bangkok's star attractions, also housing restaurants, karaoke rooms, and bars.

In an entry lobby guests were able to pick from a selection of women to spend their time with, with girls wearing badges according to their price.

Prices started at 3,200 baht (£77) for a couple of hours in a private room - with membership schemes for loyal customers.

But the complex's visitor numbers collapsed in March last year when Thailand issued a travel ban to slow the spread of Covid, with 'high risk' businesses closed.

The venue was allowed to reopen late last year and tried to tempt customers back with images of staff thoroughly cleaning the hotel and its private rooms.

But it was closed again for a second time at the end of December amid another surge of coronavirus infections in the country.

A source at the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), which owns the land and overseas the lease, said the Covid-19 pandemic had killed the massage parlour's income. They now want to change their line of business to adapt to the new economy.

The source said: 'Poseidon is on a large plot and their lease will expire in February 2024. They have requested a renewal of the 30-year lease along with a request to modify the 11-story building.

'Currently, they operate a massage parlour business but the Covid-19 outbreak has caused a downturn in business as there are no tourists. They have a budget of 200 million baht to turn the building into a three-star hotel business.'

2021-01-20 12:13:19+00:00,6,"Lockdown has been imposed on five Beijing neighbourhoods after two cases of the British Covid-19 variant were detected in the Chinese capital.

The cases had 'no genetic correlation with previously reported local cases and imported cases in Beijing', the head of the Beijing health authority Pang Xinghuo told reporters, but are 'considered to be variants of the new coronavirus discovered in the UK.'

The two cases of the UK variant were among seven new Covid-19 cases detected on Wednesday, with six found in the city's southern Daxang district alone.

China has lauded its response to the pandemic, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan just over a year ago but has been broadly brought to heel, officially killing fewer than 5,000 Chinese people.

Authorities have been swift to stamp out local clusters of cases with lockdowns, mass testing regimes and travel restrictions.

Lockdown has been imposed on five Beijing neighbourhoods after two cases of the British Covid-19 variant were detected in the Chinese capital. Above, a woman walks in a community park in Beijing on January 20 after parts of the city were locked down following a Covid-19 outbreak

With the Lunar New Year Holiday looming, officials had been keen to avoid an outbreak in Beijing, the heart of political power.

But a handful of cases have been detected in the capital in recent days, with six more reported Wednesday in southern Daxing district.

Officials said that the two cases in Daxing were linked to a UK variant believed to be a more transmissible form of the virus and were first detected on Sunday.

In total, 1.6million people have been ordered to stay at home after seven cases were reported on Wednesday, including six in southern Daxing district, while China reported 103 total cases nationally.

China has been reporting over 100 cases each day for more than a week, the highest numbers since the initial outbreak in Wuhan in March 2020, putting the country on high-alert ahead of Chinese New Year which sees millions travel across the country.

All 1.6 million residents of Daxing have been ordered to not leave Beijing unless they have received special permission from the authorities and tested negative for Covid-19 in the past three days, the district said.

Meetings of 50 or more people in the district have been banned, while 'weddings should be postponed and funerals simplified,' the district government said.

It also ordered all kindergarten, primary and secondary students in the district to study at home.

Residents of five Daxing neighbourhoods where the cases were detected were ordered to remain indoors.

Daxing includes one of the city's two international airports.

China has largely brought the virus under control even as the rest of the world struggles with mounting deaths and overburdened hospitals.

But a spate of small, localised outbreaks has prompted Chinese officials to order mass testing, strict lockdowns and to prepare to move thousands into quarantine facilities to stamp out a resurgence.

China reported 103 new cases on Wednesday, including the seven in Beijing.

Seven cases were reported in the city on Wednesday, including six in southern Daxing district. Pictured: Police guard a blocked-off street in a residential neighbourhood on January 20

The outbreaks, including in neighbouring Hebei province, have put China on high alert for a potential wave of cases ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, which falls on February 12.

Traditionally, millions of people - including many migrant workers who moved from China's outer provinces to its population hubs for work - travel home for the celebrations.

But this year, 29 provinces so far have called on employees to stay put and not travel for the holiday, South China Morning Post reports, with many cities using monetary incentives to get people to stay where they are, such as free mobile data.

Meanwhile, nearly three million people in northeastern Jilin province were placed under lockdown on Monday after a travelling salesman infected over a hundred people.

Heilongjiang, another northeastern province, has reprimanded 16 officials for 'not doing their duty' to prevent recent clusters of cases in the province, the provincial Communist Party newspaper Heilongjiang Daily reported Wednesday.

China has officially reported just over 86,000 cases of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, and 4,635 related deaths.

The majority of these occurred in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, with Beijing reporting 947 cases and 9 deaths as of January 5 (although this figure will not be higher after the latest outbreak).

However, a number of countries and news outlets have expressed doubts of China's official figures, suggesting that the Beijing government has under-reported the true number of Covid-19 cases and deaths.

The latest lockdown comes after a team of WHO scientists arrived Wuhan last week, the city where the coronavirus is believed to have first spread to humans, to investigate the origins of the disease.

Anger at China grew after a young doctor, Li Wenliang, was reprimanded for trying to raise the alarm about the disease - and subsequently died of it.

The virus was first confirmed to have spread outside China in January, when a 61-year-old woman was found to be infected with it in Thailand.

After scattered outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Japan among others, the virus barrelled into Europe and North America with full force in March and April.

But Italy, France, and Brazil have all found traces of the virus from before the WHO's China office was officially alerted about the outbreak on December 31, 2019.

The WHO's team on the ground in China finally arrived in Wuhan last week after months of negotiations to investigate the origins of the disease.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday that 'the objective is to understand how and when this new coronavirus emerged'.

Members of the WHO team tasked with investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan, China on January 14

The team was expected to investigate the animal market linked to an early cluster of cases, but it is no longer thought that this was necessarily where the virus jumped from animals to humans.

It is widely suspected that the virus originated in bats, but scientists say that it may have passed to humans via another species, possibly pangolins.

The Trump administration has touted alternative theories, rejected by China, that the virus could have leaked out from a virology lab in Wuhan.

Last Friday, the US state department claimed that some researchers at the institute had shown possible Covid-19 symptoms weeks before the outbreak came to light.

China, for its part, has promoted the idea that the virus might not have originated within its borders at all but arrived on contaminated seafood from elsewhere.

On Monday, heads of the WHO-backed Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response criticised China for not acting fast enough after the virus was first discovered there.

The panel said it was 'clear' that 'public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China' in January last year.

who in the past was accused rape and of being tied to a drug cartel and an American-born drug lord, dismissed the grave threat of the COVID-19 pandemic when he celebrated his birthday with at least 500 guests.

Félix Salgado celebrated his 64th birthday Thursday with a bash that went on into the early hours of Friday morning in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero, according to local media reports.

The fiesta was held in an open setting and inside an event hall in the capital city of Chilpancingo and featured catered food and live music despite a nationwide ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in states where the pandemic's risk level is set at orange, as is the case with Guerrero.

As of Monday, Mexico has 140,704 COVID-19 deaths - the fourth highest the world, according to John Hopkins University. Mexico is 13th in the world with 1,621,428 COVID-19 cases, but the fourth-worst hit country by the pandemic in Latin America.

The state of Guerrero has registered 28,215 coronavirus cases and 2,864 deaths.

At least 10 states in Mexico and its capital, Mexico City, are under the red risk level while 19 remain in orange.

For Salgado, it will be the third time he seeks the governor's seat in the western Mexico state of Guerrero under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Morena party in the June elections.

However, the controversies surrounding his past came to light last week when Morena party secretary general Citlalli Hernández slammed Salgado's sexual abuse allegations after being accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl in 1998 and a woman in December 2016.

The aforementioned victim said told the Guerrero State Attorney General's Office that Salgado assaulted her on three separate occasions. The woman came forward again in 2017, but the report was archived.

'It seems to me that by an act of congruence and until we know more details, it is best that we make a decision and that Félix Salgado is not a candidate,' Hernández said in an interview with W Radio. 'In Morena we cannot remain silent in the face of cases of possible rape and gender abuse.'

Salgado's checkered past included allegations that he was bribed by Zetas Cartel and Edgar 'La Barbie' Valdéz, high-ranking leader in the defunct Beltrán Leyva Cartel, during his 2005 to 2008 term as mayor of the resort city of Acapulco.

During a January 8 press conference, López Obrador said the links to criminal organizations and sexual assault accusations were just part of a ploy generated by weaker opponents looking to diminish the reputation of their stronger foes.

'It is a partisan affair and a product of the [election] season.There is a competition in some states because elections are coming, so all this generates controversy, accusations,' the president said.

There have been over 95 million cases of the highly infectious virus recorded worldwide and it has been detected on every continent including Antarctica, yet 10 nations have managed to remain virus free.

The majority of countries that have managed to escape the pandemic are remote island nations, many located in the Pacific, including Tuvalu, Palau and the Cook Islands.

There have been over 95 million cases of the highly infectious virus recorded worldwide and it has been detected on every continent including Antarctica, yet 10 nations have managed to remain virus free

All of the nations were quick to act after the pandemic hit, with stringent measures including border closures and mandatory quarantine periods for new arrivals introduced. Despite having no reported cases, the island of Tonga introduced a night time curfew from midnight to 5am.

Tokelau, a New Zealand dependency, and the British territory of Pitcairn Island are both inaccessible by aviation due to their remote locations, and both have remained free from Covid-19.

In November 2020, Samoa, which had for the previous 11 months managed to steer clear of the virus, reported its first coronavirus case which was imported from Australia.

The positive case was detected in a 70-year-old Samoan citizen who travelled to Apia from Melbourne.

In nearby American Samoa, health officials reported three people on board a container ship had tested positive for the virus.

Turkmenistan and North Korea have declared themselves coronavirus-free, although doubt has been cast on the legitimacy of this.

With a population of five million, Turkmenistan is located in central Asia and is bordered by Iran which has been ravaged by the pandemic, and leaked reports claim there has been evidence of the virus there too.

Foreign analysts believe that Covid-19 could have spread to North Korea by March last year.

1. Tuvalu

Tuvalu, a group of nine islands in the South Pacific, is situated between Hawaii and Australia and has a population of 11,646.

The island country was quick to shut its borders at the beginning of the pandemic to all foreigners and introduced a mandatory quarantine period.

The nation, which has an area of just 10 sq miles in total, has reported zero Covid-19 cases.

Tuvalu. along with Tonga, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau and the Cook Islands, are projected to receive supplies of a Covid-19 vaccine later this year.

It comes after New Zealand set aside $75 million to roll out the vaccine in the Pacific island nations with which it has a political or economic partnership.

3. Tokelau

Tokelau, a dependent territory of New Zealand in the southern Pacific Ocean, has an estimated population of just 1,411.

Proving the territory's remoteness, it cannot be accessed by aviation but only by boat, usually from Samoa in a trip that can take around 24 hours.

With just one hospital to serve the entire territory, it is no surprise that Tokelau has been keen to keep the virus at bay - and has so far successfully recorded zero cases.

Border restrictions were quickly introduced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 to the island, and all passengers have to go through a health screening in Samoa before travelling over.

2021-01-18 14:59:23+00:00,238,"China could have acted more quickly in dealing with Covid-19, the WHO's pandemic response probe declared today.

The WHO-backed Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said it was 'clear' that 'public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China' in January last year.

The panel, set up last July after countries including Australia angered China by calling for an investigation, said there was 'potential for early signs to have been acted on more rapidly' by both China and the WHO.

The criticism is at odds with the WHO's public statements at the time, when it praised China for the 'remarkable speed' with which it responded to the outbreak.

The panel also faulted the WHO itself, which has faced a chorus of criticism led by Donald Trump for being too close to Beijing - although evidence has since emerged that China withheld key information from the UN agency.

The criticism of both authorities comes as a team of WHO experts carries out a separate, politically sensitive mission in China to investigate the origins of the disease.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said today that 'no one should be in any doubt that this is a scientific exercise' to understand how the virus emerged.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pictured last January with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, has come under criticism from Donald Trump for his alleged closeness to China

China's official timeline vs new evidence Official timeline Dec 8, 2019 - Earliest date that China has acknowledged an infection Dec 31 - China first reported 'pneumonia of unknown cause' to the World Health Organisation Jan 1, 2020 - Wuhan seafood market closed for disinfection Jan 11 - China reported its first death Jan 23 - Wuhan locked down Jan 31 - WHO declared 'outbreak of international concern' as China admitted having thousands of cases Feb 23 - Italy reports cluster of cases in first major outbreak in the West New evidence Sep 2019- Blood samples are taken in a lung cancer screening trial in Italy which later test positive for coronavirus Oct-Dec - Rise in 'flu and pneumonia' cases in northern Italy which could be linked to coronavirus Nov - Sewage samples taken in Florianópolis, Brazil, suggest virus was present Nov 10 - Milanese woman has a skin biopsy, producing a sample which later shows signs of the virus Nov 17 - Leaked documents suggest case detected in China on this date Dec 1 - Chinese researchers report an infection on this date in a peer-reviewed study, but it has not been acknowledged by Beijing Dec 18 - Sewage samples taken in Milan and Turin suggest virus was circulating in the cities Jan 2020 - Sewage samples from Barcelona suggest virus was in the city Advertisement

The virus first came to light in Wuhan in December 2019 before spiralling catastrophically around the globe, killing at least two million people and bringing the global economy to an unprecedented standstill.

The expert panel was convened last July amid growing pressure on the WHO to hold an investigation, despite Beijing's efforts to postpone a probe until the pandemic was over.

The panel said last month that it was working on an 'authoritative chronology' of how the outbreak began, amid criticism of the WHO for being too credulous towards China in the early days.

In its latest report, the panel upbraided the WHO for failing to call an emergency committee or declare a 'public health emergency of international concern' until the end of January.

'It is not clear why the committee did not meet until the third week of January, nor is it clear why it was unable to agree on the declaration... when it was first convened,' the report said.

Trump claimed last May that 'China has total control' of the WHO as he announced that the US was 'terminating' its relationship with the organisation.

Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, promised during the election campaign that he would restore US ties with the WHO.

Tedros met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last January, when the WHO praised Beijing for its 'seriousness' and 'transparency' in the early days of the outbreak.

The US accused the WHO of 'parroting' the Chinese government by claiming early on that there was little evidence of human-to-human transmission.

'Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities,' the White House claimed last year.

Even as the pandemic started to spiral out of control in February, the WHO praised China for the 'remarkable speed' at which it isolated the virus.

But in private, WHO officials were bemoaning the 'minimal information' they were getting from China, according to leaked documents.

'We're currently at the stage where yes, they're giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,' a state-owned Chinese broadcaster, one WHO official said.

Anger at China grew after a young doctor, Li Wenliang, was reprimanded for trying to raise the alarm about the disease - and subsequently died of it.

A team of WHO experts arrived in Wuhan last week and were greeted by Chinese health officials wearing hazmat suits at the city's airport

The virus was first confirmed to have spread outside China in January, when a 61-year-old woman was found to be infected with it in Thailand.

After scattered outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Japan among others, the virus barrelled into Europe and North America with full force in March and April.

But Italy, France, and Brazil have all found traces of the virus from before the WHO's China office was officially alerted about the outbreak on December 31, 2019.

The WHO's team on the ground in China finally arrived in Wuhan last week after months of negotiations to investigate the origins of the disease.

Tedros said today that 'the objective is to understand how and when this new coronavirus emerged'.

The team was expected to investigate the animal market linked to an early cluster of cases, but it is no longer thought that this was necessarily where the virus jumped from animals to humans.

It is widely suspected that the virus originated in bats, but scientists say that it may have passed to humans via another species, possibly pangolins.

The Trump administration has touted alternative theories, rejected by China, that the virus could have leaked out from a virology lab in Wuhan.

Last Friday, the US state department claimed that some researchers at the institute had shown possible Covid-19 symptoms weeks before the outbreak came to light.

The nation recently received its first vaccine shipment from US pharmaceutical company Moderna.

Palauan officials had aimed to have the entire country vaccinated by April, but they say that date will 'probably be extended' due to a hold-up in the distribution of doses.

2021-01-18 11:45:07+00:00,24,"Covid-19 has swept across the globe since its initial outbreak in China in late 2019, yet there are still a handful of nations that have not recorded a single case of the virus.

There have been over 95 million cases of the highly infectious virus recorded worldwide and it has been detected on every continent including Antarctica, yet 10 nations have managed to remain virus free.

The majority of countries that have managed to escape the pandemic are remote island nations, many located in the Pacific, including Tuvalu, Palau and the Cook Islands.

There have been over 95 million cases of the highly infectious virus recorded worldwide and it has been detected on every continent including Antarctica, yet 10 nations have managed to remain virus free

All of the nations were quick to act after the pandemic hit, with stringent measures including border closures and mandatory quarantine periods for new arrivals introduced. Despite having no reported cases, the island of Tonga introduced a night time curfew from midnight to 5am.

Tokelau, a New Zealand dependency, and the British territory of Pitcairn Island are both inaccessible by aviation due to their remote locations, and both have remained free from Covid-19.

In November 2020, Samoa, which had for the previous 11 months managed to steer clear of the virus, reported its first coronavirus case which was imported from Australia.

The positive case was detected in a 70-year-old Samoan citizen who travelled to Apia from Melbourne.

In nearby American Samoa, health officials reported three people on board a container ship had tested positive for the virus.

Turkmenistan and North Korea have declared themselves coronavirus-free, although doubt has been cast on the legitimacy of this.

With a population of five million, Turkmenistan is located in central Asia and is bordered by Iran which has been ravaged by the pandemic, and leaked reports claim there has been evidence of the virus there too.

Foreign analysts believe that Covid-19 could have spread to North Korea by March last year.

1. Tuvalu

Tuvalu, a group of nine islands in the South Pacific, is situated between Hawaii and Australia and has a population of 11,646.

The island country was quick to shut its borders at the beginning of the pandemic to all foreigners and introduced a mandatory quarantine period.

The nation, which has an area of just 10 sq miles in total, has reported zero Covid-19 cases.

Tuvalu. along with Tonga, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau and the Cook Islands, are projected to receive supplies of a Covid-19 vaccine later this year.

It comes after New Zealand set aside $75 million to roll out the vaccine in the Pacific island nations with which it has a political or economic partnership.

2. Tonga

Tonga is a Polynesian country and archipelago comprising 169 islands, of which 36 are inhabited.

It is one of the more densely population nations in the Pacific with a population of 104,494.

The Polynesian kingdom has not reported a single Covid-19 case since the start of the pandemic.

Tongan borders are closed for entry to all foreign nationals, except if authorisation has been granted by the relevant government authority, and the Kingdom introduced a national night time curfew from midnight to 5am.

3. Tokelau

Tokelau, a dependent territory of New Zealand in the southern Pacific Ocean, has an estimated population of just 1,411.

Proving the territory's remoteness, it cannot be accessed by aviation but only by boat, usually from Samoa in a trip that can take around 24 hours.

With just one hospital to serve the entire territory, it is no surprise that Tokelau has been keen to keep the virus at bay - and has so far successfully recorded zero cases.

Border restrictions were quickly introduced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 to the island, and all passengers have to go through a health screening in Samoa before travelling over.

4. Saint Helena

Saint Helena is a British Overseas Territory and remote tropical volcanic island located in the South Atlantic Ocean.

It's known as the place of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile and death, as commemorated by a now-empty tomb.

Saint Helena remains Covid-19 free and has implemented strict rules for those who arrive to the island.

It requires those arriving by air to be taken on a minibus provided by the local authorities to a government quarantine facility where they spend 14 days. They are tested for the virus on arrival and at the end of the quarantine period.

Any breach of quarantine results in a fine of up to £5,000.

5. Pitcairn Islands

The Pitcairn Islands is a group of four volcanic islands in the southern Pacific Ocean that form the sole British Overseas Territory in the Pacific Ocean.

The territory is just two miles long and one mile wide.

With a population of only 50 people, the Pitcairn Islands has declared itself Covid-19 free since the beginning of the pandemic.

Those who live there are the descendants of those who arrived on the island on board the Royal Navy vessel HMS Bounty in 1789.

The small territory has said that travel restrictions will remain in place until at least March 2022.

6. Cook Islands

The Cook Islands comprises 15 islands that make up a self-governing country in the South Pacific Ocean in free association with New Zealand.

The islands, with a population of 17,459, have remained coronavirus free after closing its borders to the rest of the world.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Cook Island Prime Minister Mark Brown recently announced a travel bubble between the two countries, launching on January 21.

'Following confirmation of the Cook Islands' Covid free status and the implementation of strict health and border protocols, we are now in the position to resume quarantine-free travel for passengers from the Cook Islands into New Zealand,' Arden said in a recent statement.

7. Kiribati

Kiribati is an independent island nation in the central Pacific Ocean.

It has a permanent population of just over 110,000, more than half of whom live on Tarawa atoll. The state comprises 32 atolls and one raised coral island, Banaba.

The country acted fast to control the spread of the virus, shutting off all non-essential travel by mid-March and implementing a 14-day quarantine period.

8. Nauru

Nauru, located in Micronesia, is the third-smallest country in the world with a population of 12,700. It is known for holding Australia's off-shore immigration detention centre.

The country implemented very tight Covid-19 restrictions early on in the pandemic and has kept up efforts to monitor for the virus.

The government has declared a national emergency as a preventive measure despite recording no cases of the virus, and suspended all but one weekly flight to the country.

It also introduced a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals.

9. Niue

Niue, a coral island in the South Pacific, is one-sixth the size of greater London. It is a self-governing state in 'free association' with New Zealand.

While 1,700 Niuens live on the island, more than 30,000 – more than 95% of the its people - live in New Zealand, where they have citizenship rights.

Niue implemented tough travel restrictions at the start of the pandemic which are now beginning to ease, with the government recently agreeing to increase the number of passengers arriving from New Zealand.

The Swedish king, 74, and queen, 77, received the shots at Stenhammar Castle this morning despite the vaccine not being rolled out to over-70s till next month for the country's wider population.

They are both in good health after the dose, Sweden's Royal Court director of information Margareta Thorgren confirmed.

It comes as Sweden became one of six EU nations to complain about a delay in receiving the Pfizer vaccine today.

The health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia all signed a letter complaining about a delay in shipments of the vital vaccine.

Sweden's King Carl XI (pictured) and Queen Silvia received their first shots of the coronavirus vaccine at Stenhammar Castle today

Today, Ms Thorgen said the royal couple are happy that vaccinations have started in Sweden and hope they can set an example.

She declined to detail why the royals received a dose before Phase 2 of the vaccination process begins in Sweden, when over-70s are due to begin receiving the vaccine.

Ms Thorgen told Aftonbladet: 'It is on the advice of the royal family's life doctor.'

In a statement, the king said: 'The great vaccination against Covid-19 is now underway around our country.

'It is my hope that everyone who has the opportunity to be vaccinated in these coming months chooses to do so, so that together and as soon as possible we can get through this difficult time.'

The announcement comes days after Buckingham Palace revealed the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, have been given the Covid-19 vaccination at Windsor Castle

King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway received their first dose of the vaccine yesterday while the UK's Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh , 99, were given the Covid-19 vaccination at Windsor Castle on Saturday.

The vaccine - developed by Pfizer with German partner BioNTech - started being delivered in the EU at the end of December.

US biotech firm Moderna began delivering its shot this week.

Yet about one third of the 27 EU governments cited 'insufficient' doses at a video conference of health ministers on Wednesday, a person who attended the virtual meeting told Reuters.

In a letter sent on Friday, six EU governments asked the European Commission to pressure Pfizer-BioNTech 'to ensure stability and transparency of timely (vaccine) deliveries'.

'This situation is unacceptable,' said the letter, signed by the health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

'Not only does it impact the planned vaccination schedules, it also decreases the credibility of the vaccination process.'

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken to Pfizer and been reassured that scheduled deliveries will be made in the first quarter of 2021.

Pfizer said there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost production.

The royal couple, both 83, revealed they were inoculated with the jab yesterday, with a brief statement from the Royal Court reading: 'His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen have today been vaccinated against the coronavirus.

'The royal couple will receive the next vaccine in three weeks.'

The announcement comes days after Buckingham Palace revealed the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, have been given the Covid-19 vaccination at Windsor Castle.

King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, both 83, have become the latest royals to announce they have received the Covid-19 vaccination

The Monarch and Prince Philip have joined more than 1.5million people across Britain who have been given the jab since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in December.

The UK has since permitted the use of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab, alongside an inoculation against coronavirus developed by Moderna.

News of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's vaccination is unusual from Buckingham Palace, which rarely comments on the private health matters of the royal couple.

It is understood the Queen decided the information should be made public to prevent inaccuracies and further speculation.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received Covid-19 vaccinations.'

A royal source confirmed the injections were administered by a Household Doctor at Windsor Castle.

The Queen and Philip have been spending lockdown sheltering at their Berkshire home after deciding to have a quiet Christmas and forgo the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham.

Confirmation of the royal couple's inoculations comes a month after British grandmother Margaret Keenan, 91, became the first person in the world to receive a Covid-19 vaccination on December 8.

Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 80, was the first royal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and was inoculated on New Year's Day

It has since been offered to people over 80 or those who are at high risk from the virus, with people who live or work in care homes also top of the list to receive the jab.

Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 80, was the first royal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and was inoculated on New Year's Day, according to a brief statement issued by the Royal Court.

It was also confirmed that the monarch would receive the second dose in around three weeks as is usual with the batch.

The statement from the Danish royal house read: 'Her Majesty the Queen was vaccinated today against COVID-19. The Queen will be re-vaccinated in about three weeks' time.'

Officials in northern China's Hebei Province announced that a woman with a severe heart disease had died of multiple organ failure caused by the coronavirus on Wednesday afternoon, reported state-run Xinhua News Agency.

The patient had tested positive for Covid-19 on January 9, the authorities said. Her condition rapidly worsened after being admitted to a local hospital.

The woman was said to have suffered a number of serious underlying health conditions. She was pronounced dead yesterday after all treatments had failed.

The latest death is the first one reported in China since May 16 when the National Health Commission registered a deceased patient in north-eastern Jilin Province retrospectively. The country's death toll now stands at 4,635.

The Chinese province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, has emerged as a new virus hot spot

China has been battling to contain a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, while World Health Organization experts prepared to fly to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic.

The nation's biggest daily jump in coronavirus cases since March 5 was reported on Thursday, with 138 infections noted compared to 115 cases a day earlier.

Infections in the northeastern Heilongjiang province have nearly tripled, underscoring a growing threat ahead of the Lunar New Year on February 12.

The Commission said 124 of the new cases were local infections, 81 of which were reported in Hebei province surrounding Beijing and 43 in Heilongjiang.

Heilongjiang, which has more than 37million residents, declared an 'emergency state' on Wednesday, ordering residents not to leave the province unless absolutely necessary.

Meanwhile, millions were seen lining up in sub-zero temperatures to receive a second round of coronavirus tests in the capital of Hebei province yesterday.

The province, with a population of around 75million, has emerged as the new Covid-19 epicentre in China's latest outbreak of the deadly virus.

Though the recent increases in cases remain a fraction of what the country saw at the height of the pandemic, China put more than 28 million people under home quarantine in January in a bid to curb the spread of the disease.

The new wave of infections comes ahead of next month's Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people typically travel to their home towns.

The resurgence has already prompted some provinces to discourage travel, which could lead to reduced travel and dampen consumption during the long break.

China had largely brought the coronavirus under control since its emergence in Wuhan late in 2019.

But recent weeks have seen smatterings of cases, prompting localised lockdowns, immediate travel restrictions and widespread testing of tens of millions of people.

More than 20million people are now under some form of lockdown in the country's northern regions.

All of the 37.5million residents of Heilongjiang have been ordered not to leave the area unless absolutely necessary, and to cancel conferences and gatherings.

Suihua city, a short car journey north and home to more than 5.2million people, was sealed off on Monday after reporting one confirmed case and 45 asymptomatic cases.

Several other small cities near Suihua were also sealed off or placed under travel restrictions, authorities said Wednesday.

On Tuesday, officials in Shijiazhuang ordered the city's roughly 11million residents to undergo a second round of testing as authorities seek to isolate the sources of the outbreak.

Some of the infections have been tentatively linked to wedding gatherings.

The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 78 from 38 a day earlier.

Carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the biggest contributors to global warming. After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there, making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.

It is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as cement production.

The average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, as of April 2019, is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration was just 280 ppm.

CO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800,000 years between 180 to 280ppm, but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.

Nitrogen dioxide

The gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels, car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.

Although there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2, it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.

Sulfur dioxide

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning, but can also be released from car exhausts.

SO2 can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.

Carbon monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with hydroxyl radicals, removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Particulates

What is particulate matter?

Particulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.

Some are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.

Materials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.

Particulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).

Air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels, cars, cement making and agriculture

Scientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.

Particulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels, driving cars and steel making.

Why are particulates dangerous?

Particulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.

Health impact

What sort of health problems can pollution cause?

According to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.

Some of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.

As well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.

Particulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.

Deaths from pollution

Around seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.

Asthma triggers

Air pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.

Problems in pregnancy

Women exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.

Living within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by University of Cincinnati found.

For every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.

Previous research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.

What is being done to tackle air pollution?

Paris agreement on climate change

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.

It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.

Carbon neutral by 2050

The UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.

They plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.

Some critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.

International carbon credits let nations continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.

No new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040

In 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.

However, MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.

Norway's electric car subsidies

The speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies. Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.

A VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.

Criticisms of inaction on climate change

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.

The committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed – from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains – and found no real progress in any of them.

The UK is not prepared for 2°C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4°C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.

It added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect, and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.",MailOnline,"['climate', 'uk', 'impact', 'lockdowns', 'air', 'study', 'particulates', 'expected', 'smaller', 'cars', 'finds', 'quality', 'covid19', 'burning', 'fossil', 'carbon', 'agreement', 'pollution']",0

What is particulate matter?

Particulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.

Some are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.

Materials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.

Particulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).

Air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels, cars, cement making and agriculture

Scientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.

Particulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels, driving cars and steel making.

Why are particulates dangerous?

Particulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.

Health impact

What sort of health problems can pollution cause?

According to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.

Some of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.

As well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.

Particulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.

Deaths from pollution

Around seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.

Asthma triggers

Air pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.

Problems in pregnancy

Women exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.

Living within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by University of Cincinnati found.

For every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.

Previous research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.

What is being done to tackle air pollution?

Paris agreement on climate change

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.

It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.

Carbon neutral by 2050

The UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.

They plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.

Some critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.

International carbon credits let nations continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.

No new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040

In 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.

However, MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change. Pictured: air pollution over Paris in 2019.

Norway's electric car subsidies

The speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies. Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.

A VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.

Criticisms of inaction on climate change

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.

The committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed – from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains – and found no real progress in any of them.

The UK is not prepared for 2°C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4°C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.

It added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect, and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.",MailOnline,"['climate', 'uk', 'impact', 'lockdowns', 'air', 'study', 'particulates', 'expected', 'smaller', 'cars', 'finds', 'quality', 'covid19', 'burning', 'fossil', 'carbon', 'agreement', 'pollution']",0

Officials in northern China's Hebei Province announced that a woman with a severe heart disease had died of multiple organ failure caused by the coronavirus on Wednesday afternoon, reported state-run Xinhua News Agency.

The patient had tested positive for Covid-19 on January 9, the authorities said. Her condition rapidly worsened after being admitted to a local hospital.

The woman was said to have suffered a number of serious underlying health conditions. She was pronounced dead yesterday after all treatments had failed.

The latest death is the first one reported in China since May 16 when the National Health Commission registered a deceased patient in north-eastern Jilin Province retrospectively. The country's death toll now stands at 4,635.

The Chinese province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, has emerged as a new virus hot spot

China has been battling to contain a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, while World Health Organization experts prepared to fly to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic.

The nation's biggest daily jump in coronavirus cases since March 5 was reported on Thursday, with 138 infections noted compared to 115 cases a day earlier.

Infections in the northeastern Heilongjiang province have nearly tripled, underscoring a growing threat ahead of the Lunar New Year on February 12.

The Commission said 124 of the new cases were local infections, 81 of which were reported in Hebei province surrounding Beijing and 43 in Heilongjiang.

Heilongjiang, which has more than 37million residents, declared an 'emergency state' on Wednesday, ordering residents not to leave the province unless absolutely necessary.

Meanwhile, millions were seen lining up in sub-zero temperatures to receive a second round of coronavirus tests in the capital of Hebei province yesterday.

The province, with a population of around 75million, has emerged as the new Covid-19 epicentre in China's latest outbreak of the deadly virus.

Though the recent increases in cases remain a fraction of what the country saw at the height of the pandemic, China put more than 28 million people under home quarantine in January in a bid to curb the spread of the disease.

The new wave of infections comes ahead of next month's Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people typically travel to their home towns.

The resurgence has already prompted some provinces to discourage travel, which could lead to reduced travel and dampen consumption during the long break.

China had largely brought the coronavirus under control since its emergence in Wuhan late in 2019.

But recent weeks have seen smatterings of cases, prompting localised lockdowns, immediate travel restrictions and widespread testing of tens of millions of people.

More than 20million people are now under some form of lockdown in the country's northern regions.

All of the 37.5million residents of Heilongjiang have been ordered not to leave the area unless absolutely necessary, and to cancel conferences and gatherings.

Several other small cities near Suihua were also sealed off or placed under travel restrictions, authorities said Wednesday.

On Tuesday, officials in Shijiazhuang ordered the city's roughly 11million residents to undergo a second round of testing as authorities seek to isolate the sources of the outbreak.

The Brazilian Butantan biomedical centre announced last week the Sinovac Biotech jab had proved 78.4 per cent effective against 'mild to severe' cases which required treatment.

But it has now been revealed their results did not include 'very mild' infections from those who had received the vaccine but did not need medical assistance.

With this data included, the success rate has now dropped to 50.4 per cent, barely sufficient for the 50 per cent minimum for regulatory approval.

It is also well below the 70 per cent recommended by the Chinese government and the World Health Organisation.

The news is a major disappointment for Brazil, as the Chinese vaccine is one of two that the federal government had lined up to administer during their deadly Covid surge.

Sinovac's chairman has insisted the vaccine is highly effective and prevents 100 per cent of severe Covid cases.

China's Covid vaccine was only 50.4 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic infections in a Brazilian trial

Many have criticised the Butantan biomedical centre for releasing partial data just days ago that generated unrealistic expectations.

The results came from a trial of 13,000 people in Brazil in the most advanced final phase of testing.

The trial saw 220 people infected of which 160 were in the placebo group and 60 received the vaccine.

They insisted last week the results were sufficient for 'clinical efficacy' and are insisting the vaccine is still 78 per cent effective in preventing mild cases that would need treatment.

It is still not clear how the efficacy rate was calculated by the Brazilian officials and a detailed breakdown of the study, showing age groups and side effects, has not been published.

The confusion may add to skepticism in Brazil about the Chinese vaccine, which President Jair Bolsonaro has criticized, questioning its 'origins.'

Many have criticised the Butantan biomedical center for releasing partial data just days ago that generated unrealistic expectations

'We have a good vaccine. Not the best vaccine in the world. Not the ideal vaccine,' said microbiologist Natalia Pasternak, criticizing Butantan's triumphant tone.

Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at Butantan, said on Tuesday that the new lower efficacy finding included data on those 'very mild' cases.

'We need better communicators,' said Gonzalo Vecina Neto, a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo and former head of Brazilian health regulator Anvisa.

Sinovac chairman Yin Weidong said on Wednesday: 'This data shows that the vaccines have good efficacy and safety in all the phase 3 clinical trials. We have accelerated the ramping up of production capacity.'

He added that the jab was 100 per cent effective at preventing severe cases, 78 per cent effective against cases requiring treatment and 50 per cent effective at 'protecting medical workers'.

Weidong also cited figures from other trials which showed a much higher efficacy rate.

Piecemeal disclosures about Chinese vaccine trials globally have raised concerns that they are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.

Palacios and officials in the Sao Paulo state government, which funds Butantan, emphasized the good news that none of the volunteers inoculated with CoronaVac had to be hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms.

Public health experts said that alone will be a relief for Brazilian hospitals that are buckling under the strain of surging case loads. However, it will take longer to curb the pandemic with a vaccine that allows so many mild cases.

The news is a major disappointment for Brazil, as the Chinese vaccine is one of two that the federal government had lined up to administer

'It's a vaccine that will start the process of overcoming the pandemic,' Pasternak said.

Sinovac uses an inactivated version of the virus to stimulate the body's immune response.

One major advantage is that it can be stored at refrigerator temperature, making them easy to distribute to the developing world.

China has already administered 4.5million of the jabs to its citizens as part of its plan to vaccinate 50million people by early February.

Researchers at Butantan delayed announcement of their results three times, blaming a confidentiality clause in a contract with Sinovac.

In the meantime, Turkish researchers said last month that CoronaVac was 91.25 per cent effective based on an interim analysis. Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency use approval on Monday based on interim data showing it is 65 per cent effective.

Butantan officials said the design of the Brazilian study, focusing on frontline health workers during a severe outbreak in Brazil and including elderly volunteers, made it impossible to compare the results directly with other trials or vaccines.

Still, Covid-19 vaccines in use from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc proved to be about 95 per cent effective in preventing illness in their pivotal late-state trials.

The disappointing CoronaVac data is the latest setback for vaccination efforts in Brazil, where more than 200,000 people have died since the outbreak began - the worst death toll outside the United States.

Brazil's national immunisation programme currently relies on CoronaVac and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc - neither of which has received regulatory approval in Brazil.

Anvisa, which has stipulated an efficacy rate of at least 50 per cent for vaccines in the pandemic, has already pressed Butantan for more details of its study, after it filed for emergency use authorization on Friday.

The regulator said it will meet on Sunday to decide on emergency use requests for CoronaVac and the British vaccine.

The disappointing CoronaVac data is the latest setback for vaccination efforts in Brazil, where more than 200,000 people have died since the outbreak began - the worst death toll outside the United States.

Brazil's national immunisation programme currently relies on CoronaVac and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc - neither of which has received regulatory approval in Brazil.

Anvisa, which has stipulated an efficacy rate of at least 50 per cent for vaccines in the pandemic, has already pressed Butantan for more details of its study, after it filed for emergency use authorization on Friday.

The regulator said it will meet on Sunday to decide on emergency use requests for CoronaVac and the British vaccine.

The Brazilian Butantan biomedical centre announced last week the Sinovac Biotech jab had proved 78.4 per cent effective against 'mild to severe' cases which required treatment.

But it has now been revealed their results did not include 'very mild' infections from those who had received the vaccine but did not need medical assistance.

With this data included, the success rate has now dropped to 50.4 per cent, barely sufficient for the 50 per cent minimum for regulatory approval.

It is also well below the 70 per cent recommended by the Chinese government and the World Health Organisation.

The news is a major disappointment for Brazil, as the Chinese vaccine is one of two that the federal government had lined up to administer during their deadly Covid surge.

Sinovac's chairman has insisted the vaccine is highly effective and prevents 100 per cent of severe Covid cases.

China's Covid vaccine was only 50.4 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic infections in a Brazilian trial

Many have criticised the Butantan biomedical centre for releasing partial data just days ago that generated unrealistic expectations.

The results came from a trial of 13,000 people in Brazil in the most advanced final phase of testing.

The trial saw 220 people infected of which 160 were in the placebo group and 60 received the vaccine.

They insisted last week the results were sufficient for 'clinical efficacy' and are insisting the vaccine is still 78 per cent effective in preventing mild cases that would need treatment.

It is still not clear how the efficacy rate was calculated by the Brazilian officials and a detailed breakdown of the study, showing age groups and side effects, has not been published.

The confusion may add to skepticism in Brazil about the Chinese vaccine, which President Jair Bolsonaro has criticized, questioning its 'origins.'

'We have a good vaccine. Not the best vaccine in the world. Not the ideal vaccine,' said microbiologist Natalia Pasternak, criticizing Butantan's triumphant tone.

Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at Butantan, said on Tuesday that the new lower efficacy finding included data on those 'very mild' cases.

'We need better communicators,' said Gonzalo Vecina Neto, a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo and former head of Brazilian health regulator Anvisa.

Sinovac chairman Yin Weidong said on Wednesday: 'This data shows that the vaccines have good efficacy and safety in all the phase 3 clinical trials. We have accelerated the ramping up of production capacity.'

He added that the jab was 100 per cent effective at preventing severe cases, 78 per cent effective against cases requiring treatment and 50 per cent effective at 'protecting medical workers'.

Weidong also cited figures from other trials which showed a much higher efficacy rate.

Piecemeal disclosures about Chinese vaccine trials globally have raised concerns that they are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.

Palacios and officials in the Sao Paulo state government, which funds Butantan, emphasized the good news that none of the volunteers inoculated with CoronaVac had to be hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms.

Public health experts said that alone will be a relief for Brazilian hospitals that are buckling under the strain of surging case loads. However, it will take longer to curb the pandemic with a vaccine that allows so many mild cases.

'It's a vaccine that will start the process of overcoming the pandemic,' Pasternak said.

Sinovac uses an inactivated version of the virus to stimulate the body's immune response.

One major advantage is that it can be stored at refrigerator temperature, making them easy to distribute to the developing world.

China has already administered 4.5million of the jabs to its citizens as part of its plan to vaccinate 50million people by early February.

Researchers at Butantan delayed announcement of their results three times, blaming a confidentiality clause in a contract with Sinovac.

Each person has a unique assortment of bacteria in their gut which play a variety of roles, including in modulating the immune response. Research from the Chinese University of Hong Kong found people suffering with Covid-19 had a 'significantly altered' microbiome composition (stock)

The team from Hong Kong examined blood, stool and patient records from 100 hospital patients with Covid-19 between February and May 2020, and 27 of these patients also provided samples 30 days after the infection had passed.

Researchers also collected samples from 78 people without Covid-19 who were taking part in a microbiome study before the pandemic.

The study concludes the gut microbiome may be involved in the 'magnitude of Covid-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses'.

The authors found that patients with Covid-19 had depleted levels of several gut bacteria known to modify a person's immune response.

For example, there was evidence of elevated levels of some bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques and Bacteroides dorei.

There was also depleted levels of microbes known to help the immune system, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium bifidum.

The changes to bacterial composition endured for at least a month after the virus had cleared.

Foods and supplements to help Covid-proof your gut A balanced diet that consists of items from all the major food groups is the best way to maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Some species of bacteria live in our guts and help us digest food that our bodies would otherwise be unable to get nutrition from. As a by-product of this process, the microbiome also boosts metabolism, digestion and the immune system. The Hong Kong research found people with Covid had low levels of the bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium bifidum. They also found elevated levels of Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus. These bacteria play a role in regulating the immune response and if their levels rise in comparison to other bacteria they can have negative side-effects. 'R. gnavus and R. torques in the gut have been reported to co-occur with inflammatory bowel disease and B. dorei and B. vulgatus are implicated in several inflammatory gut diseases such as irritable bowel disease and ulcerative colitis,' the researchers write in their study. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii - found in chicory, wheat, onion, banana, garlic and leek The amount of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is increased by a molecule called inulin. Inulin is a polysaccharide which means it is various sugar molecules bonded together. Inulin is naturally-occurring in wheat, onion, banana, garlic, and leek. However, it is abundant in chicory and has been extracted on an industrial scale and turned into a supplement. Inulin powder and capsules can be bought off the shelf from Holland and Barrett, and other retailers. Bifidobacterium bifidum - found in fermented food, whole grains and prebiotics Growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum is promoted by fibre and also fermented products such as kombucha, kefir and kimchi. Whole grains and polyphenols (found in cocoa, red wine, grape skins and almonds) have also been found to improve production of Bifidobacteria. Off-the shelf prebiotic supplements are also believed to boost the amount of Bifidiobacteria in the gut. Ruminococcus gnavus - can be reduced by eating apples and pears According to a 2016 study, apples and pears are good at reducing levels of R. gnavus. 'Our finding that total fruit and apple/pear serve intakes were both shown to be negatively associated with the relative abundance of species related to R. gnavus is somewhat surprising,' researchers write in the study. Ruminococcus torques - can be reduced by earing fruit The above study says their 'surprising' finding is backed up by research, also published in 2016, which looked at almost 1,200 adults. 'A recent large Dutch population based study... found that fruit intake was negatively associated with the abundance of the closely related R. torques,' the study says. Bacteroides dorei - source unknown This bacteria was only discovered in 2016 when it was found in the faeces of humans. It is able to feed off a wide variety of sugars and due to it only recently being discovered there is little information available as to what foods cause higher or lower levels of the bacteria.

'In light of reports that a subset of recovered patients with COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnoea [breathlessness] and joint pains, some over 80 days after initial onset of symptoms, we posit that the dysbiotic gut microbiome could contribute to immune-related health problems post-COVID-19,' the authors write in their paper, published in the journal Gut.

Blood samples revealed this microbial imbalance was also linked to higher levels of cytokines, small molecules which are a natural part of the immune response but can cause damage if not properly regulated.

How tocilizumab and sarilumab work The two drugs tocilizumab and sarilumab are anti inflammatory. They are currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and similar conditions. In Covid patients they inhibit a specific part of the immune system which occurs when the body goes haywire and attacks itself. it stops little molecules called interleukin 6 (IL-6) from latching on to their receptors. Normally, when they bind to the receptors they cause it to die, which leads to significant damage. In Covid patients this happens in the lungs and airways and leads to respiratory issues. By getting in the way of this pathway the drugs allow the body to retain its natural immune response equilibrium and improve a patient's condition. Advertisement

A hallmark of severe Covid is the immune system going haywire following coronavirus infection and, in severe cases, attacking healthy cells and tissues.

This so-called 'cytokine storm' sees the small molecules pumped out in vast quantities as their regulatory system is broken and they go on to wreak havoc.

This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially fatal condition.

If a patient's condition deteriorates to this point, it is difficult to intervene and, as a result, preventing cytokine storms has become a primary focus of coronavirus drug trials.

Two such treatments, anti-inflammatories called tocilizumab and sarilumab which are currently used to treat arthritis, were recently approved for use in intensive care on Covid-19 patients by the NHS.

Recent results from the REMAP-CAP clinical trial showed people who only received dexamethasone in intensive care had a death rate of 35.8 per cent. This dropped to just 25.3 per cent when they were also given either tocilizumab or sarilumab.

The latest study was observational and is unable to say if Covid-19 changes the gut microbiome, or a weakened microbiome leads to more severe infection.

However, a separate study by South Korean researchers, published in Mbio, although only a review, indicates the latter option is the most likely.

Research from South Korea found people with a poorly functioning gut are more likely to develop severe Covid-19 because the lack of healthy microbes makes it easier for the virus to infect cells in the digestive tract (stock)

Academics at Korea University's Laboratory for Human-Microbial Interactions analysed data from various studies which looked at the impact of poor gut health on coronavirus infection.

Dr Heenam Stanley Kim, who led the review, believes there is now substantial evidence to back up the claims that gut microbiome pays an integral role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Dr Kim says a dysfunctional gut may exacerbate the severity of infection because lower microbial levels make it easier for the coronavirus to reach the surface of the digestive tract and internal organs.

These organs have a receptor on their surface called ACE2 and this protruding protein is what the virus hijacks in order to gain access to a cell. it is found in high quantities in the lungs and respiratory tract as well as the digestive system.

'There seems to be a clear connection between the altered gut microbiome and severe COVID-19,' Dr Kim said.

Gut microbiome is highly sensitive and reacts based on a person's health, diet and environment.

Scientists continue to learn more about importance but it is known that people with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes have an imbalanced microbiome.

Older people are at the highest risk of dying from Covid-19 — the CDC in the US says over-85s are 630 times more likely to die from Covid-19 infection than a person aged between 18 and 29 — and also often suffer with poorly functioning microbiomes, Dr Kim says.",MailOnline,"['immune', 'levels', 'affects', 'patients', 'study', 'severe', 'microbiome', 'covid19', 'ruminococcus', 'bacteria', 'severity', 'gut']",0

The latest study was observational and is unable to say if Covid-19 changes the gut microbiome, or a weakened microbiome leads to more severe infection.

However, a separate study by South Korean researchers, published in Mbio, although only a review, indicates the latter option is the most likely.

Research from South Korea found people with a poorly functioning gut are more likely to develop severe Covid-19 because the lack of healthy microbes makes it easier for the virus to infect cells in the digestive tract (stock)

Academics at Korea University's Laboratory for Human-Microbial Interactions analysed data from various studies which looked at the impact of poor gut health on coronavirus infection.

Dr Heenam Stanley Kim, who led the review, believes there is now substantial evidence to back up the claims that gut microbiome pays an integral role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Dr Kim says a dysfunctional gut may exacerbate the severity of infection because lower microbial levels make it easier for the coronavirus to reach the surface of the digestive tract and internal organs.

These organs have a receptor on their surface called ACE2 and this protruding protein is what the virus hijacks in order to gain access to a cell. it is found in high quantities in the lungs and respiratory tract as well as the digestive system.

'There seems to be a clear connection between the altered gut microbiome and severe COVID-19,' Dr Kim said.

Gut microbiome is highly sensitive and reacts based on a person's health, diet and environment.

Scientists continue to learn more about importance but it is known that people with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes have an imbalanced microbiome.

Older people are at the highest risk of dying from Covid-19 — the CDC in the US says over-85s are 630 times more likely to die from Covid-19 infection than a person aged between 18 and 29 — and also often suffer with poorly functioning microbiomes, Dr Kim says.",MailOnline,"['immune', 'levels', 'affects', 'patients', 'study', 'severe', 'microbiome', 'covid19', 'ruminococcus', 'bacteria', 'severity', 'gut']",0

Each person has a unique assortment of bacteria in their gut which play a variety of roles, including in modulating the immune response. Research from the Chinese University of Hong Kong found people suffering with Covid-19 had a 'significantly altered' microbiome composition (stock)

The team from Hong Kong examined blood, stool and patient records from 100 hospital patients with Covid-19 between February and May 2020, and 27 of these patients also provided samples 30 days after the infection had passed.

Researchers also collected samples from 78 people without Covid-19 who were taking part in a microbiome study before the pandemic.

The study concludes the gut microbiome may be involved in the 'magnitude of Covid-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses'.

The authors found that patients with Covid-19 had depleted levels of several gut bacteria known to modify a person's immune response.

For example, there was evidence of elevated levels of some bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques and Bacteroides dorei.

There was also depleted levels of microbes known to help the immune system, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium bifidum.

The changes to bacterial composition endured for at least a month after the virus had cleared.

Foods and supplements to help Covid-proof your gut A balanced diet that consists of items from all the major food groups is the best way to maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Some species of bacteria live in our guts and help us digest food that our bodies would otherwise be unable to get nutrition from. As a by-product of this process, the microbiome also boosts metabolism, digestion and the immune system. The Hong Kong research found people with Covid had low levels of the bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium bifidum. They also found elevated levels of Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus. These bacteria play a role in regulating the immune response and if their levels rise in comparison to other bacteria they can have negative side-effects. 'R. gnavus and R. torques in the gut have been reported to co-occur with inflammatory bowel disease and B. dorei and B. vulgatus are implicated in several inflammatory gut diseases such as irritable bowel disease and ulcerative colitis,' the researchers write in their study. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii - found in chicory, wheat, onion, banana, garlic and leek The amount of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is increased by a molecule called inulin. Inulin is a polysaccharide which means it is various sugar molecules bonded together. Inulin is naturally-occurring in wheat, onion, banana, garlic, and leek. However, it is abundant in chicory and has been extracted on an industrial scale and turned into a supplement. Inulin powder and capsules can be bought off the shelf from Holland and Barrett, and other retailers. Bifidobacterium bifidum - found in fermented food, whole grains and prebiotics Growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum is promoted by fibre and also fermented products such as kombucha, kefir and kimchi. Whole grains and polyphenols (found in cocoa, red wine, grape skins and almonds) have also been found to improve production of Bifidobacteria. Off-the shelf prebiotic supplements are also believed to boost the amount of Bifidiobacteria in the gut. Ruminococcus gnavus - can be reduced by eating apples and pears According to a 2016 study, apples and pears are good at reducing levels of R. gnavus. 'Our finding that total fruit and apple/pear serve intakes were both shown to be negatively associated with the relative abundance of species related to R. gnavus is somewhat surprising,' researchers write in the study. Ruminococcus torques - can be reduced by earing fruit The above study says their 'surprising' finding is backed up by research, also published in 2016, which looked at almost 1,200 adults. 'A recent large Dutch population based study... found that fruit intake was negatively associated with the abundance of the closely related R. torques,' the study says. Bacteroides dorei - source unknown This bacteria was only discovered in 2016 when it was found in the faeces of humans. It is able to feed off a wide variety of sugars and due to it only recently being discovered there is little information available as to what foods cause higher or lower levels of the bacteria.

'In light of reports that a subset of recovered patients with COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnoea [breathlessness] and joint pains, some over 80 days after initial onset of symptoms, we posit that the dysbiotic gut microbiome could contribute to immune-related health problems post-COVID-19,' the authors write in their paper, published in the journal Gut.

Blood samples revealed this microbial imbalance was also linked to higher levels of cytokines, small molecules which are a natural part of the immune response but can cause damage if not properly regulated.

How tocilizumab and sarilumab work The two drugs tocilizumab and sarilumab are anti inflammatory. They are currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and similar conditions. In Covid patients they inhibit a specific part of the immune system which occurs when the body goes haywire and attacks itself. it stops little molecules called interleukin 6 (IL-6) from latching on to their receptors. Normally, when they bind to the receptors they cause it to die, which leads to significant damage. In Covid patients this happens in the lungs and airways and leads to respiratory issues. By getting in the way of this pathway the drugs allow the body to retain its natural immune response equilibrium and improve a patient's condition. Advertisement

A hallmark of severe Covid is the immune system going haywire following coronavirus infection and, in severe cases, attacking healthy cells and tissues.

This so-called 'cytokine storm' sees the small molecules pumped out in vast quantities as their regulatory system is broken and they go on to wreak havoc.

This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially fatal condition.

If a patient's condition deteriorates to this point, it is difficult to intervene and, as a result, preventing cytokine storms has become a primary focus of coronavirus drug trials.

Two such treatments, anti-inflammatories called tocilizumab and sarilumab which are currently used to treat arthritis, were recently approved for use in intensive care on Covid-19 patients by the NHS.

2021-01-12 16:40:05+00:00,59,"The experts behind the BioNTech coronavirus jab have developed another vaccine which they claim cures multiple sclerosis (MS) in mice.

The new MS vaccine works in a similar way to the coronavirus vaccine, manufactured in conjunction with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.

A piece of genetic material known as mRNA is inserted into a person's arm and forces the body's own cells to produce a protein that confers immunity.

In the case of the coronavirus vaccine, this protein mimics the virus's protruding spike, kickstarting the immune system to start making antibodies.

If a person later contracts the coronavirus, the immune system rapidly creates antibodies again and fights the infection before it can take hold or spread.

In the case of the MS vaccine, the mRNA technology stops the body's own immune system from attacking neurons in the brain and spinal cord which prevents the eventual loss of bodily function.

Clinical trials on mice revealed the jab cured the condition, stopped disease progression and restored some motor skills which had already been lost.

Clinical trials on mice revealed the MS jab cured the condition, stopped disease progression and restores some motor skills which had already been lost (stock)

The BioNtech coronavirus jab is 95 per cent effective and was the first mRNA vaccine to ever receive approval for human use outside of clinical trials.

It was approved by the MHRA on December 2, given to the first UK patient on December 8 and is now being administered to thousands every day.

Its approval has been hailed as a watershed moment in immunology and experts are hopeful the technology can eradicate more diseases.

mRNA is genetic material which is naturally found in the human body.

It is used by human cells to carry messages and give instructions. DNA's double-helix is split in half, there is a molecular substitution, and it is then sent out of the nucleus and into the cellular cytoplasm to relay the message.

Another part of the cell then reads its genetic sequence — the message — and goes about doing as it is told, which often means making a specific protein.

After providing the blueprint, the mRNA molecule is then destroyed by another part of the cell.

This technology has been in development for decades but has only now reached a point where it is viable for use as a vaccine.

In a wonderful twist, the second person to get the Pfizer coronavirus jab in the UK on December 8 was William Shakespeare from Warwickshire (pictured)

Inventor of Biontech jab adds $4bn to his fortune The inventor of the BioNTech jab has added $4 billion to his personal fortune, while his investors have made double that as countries continue to scramble to inoculate populations from coronavirus. Ugur Sahin, CEO and founder of the German biotech firm that has teamed up with Pfizer on its vaccine, has seen share prices soar over the past year. With $5.24bn to his name, he is now the 478th richest person on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index. High-profile BioNTech investors Thomas and Andreas Strungmann have profited even further over the last 12 months, both adding $8bn to their net worths to reach a total of more than $12bn. Share prices have also risen in Pfizer as well as the makers of other Covid vaccines, AstraZeneca and Moderna. While their respective CEOs haven't made the Billionaire's Index, Brazil's richest man, Jorge Paulo Lemann, is financing AstraZeneca's trials in the country, and has seen his wealth rise $176m this year. Meanwhile, Moderna's rise has seen the fortunes of professors Tim Springer from Harvard, and Robert Langer from MIT increase substantially as well, making $2bn and $1.5bn in gains. Share prices have soared in BioNTech over the last year after it teamed up with Pfizer to develop a coronavirus vaccine Advertisement

US-firm Moderna also made a mRNA vaccine for coronavirus, which last week received MHRA approval.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab does not use mRNA and instead uses a technique which has been around for decades, is cheaper to produce, and easier to transport. It received MHRA approval for emergency use in the UK in December.

Dr Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech, applied mRNA technology to multiple sclerosis.

The disease is a result of the body's own immune system attacking a protective layer that surrounds neurons, called the myelin sheath, in the brain and spinal cord.

The fatty substance allows for electric pulses to be passed through the cells and without it messages from the brain fail to reach the muscles they are sent to.

As a result of this interruption the patient progressively loses more function of their own body before the condition eventually stops them from being able to breathe.

Current treatments work by dampening the person's immune system to delay and halt the degradation of the myelin sheath, but this leaves the person vulnerable to infections as they are unable to fight off any viruses or bacteria.

Dr Sahin's theory was that a vaccine could introduce genetic information which instructed the immune system of MS sufferers to not attack the proteins that lead to myelin sheath deterioration.

The genetic material is fragile and must be protected inside a durable case, made of lipids, during injection to ensure it reaches cells before it breaks down. The Covid-19 vaccine also has this protective casing.

Dr Sahin's team gave the vaccine as an injection to mice that had autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal equivalent for human MS.

'The vaccine blocked all clinical signs of MS in mice, while control animals experienced the typical symptoms of the disease,' BioNTech said in a statement.

Some mice already had symptoms of MS before they received the vaccine, for example paralysis of the tail, and in these specimens the vaccine not only prevented further disease progression but also reversed paralysis, restoring motor functions.

The changes to bacterial composition endured for at least a month after the virus had cleared.

Foods and supplements to help Covid-proof your gut A balanced diet that consists of items from all the major food groups is the best way to maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Some species of bacteria live in our guts and help us digest food that our bodies would otherwise be unable to get nutrition from. As a by-product of this process, the microbiome also boosts metabolism, digestion and the immune system. The Hong Kong research found people with Covid had low levels of the bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium bifidum. They also found elevated levels of Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus. These bacteria play a role in regulating the immune response and if their levels rise in comparison to other bacteria they can have negative side-effects. 'R. gnavus and R. torques in the gut have been reported to co-occur with inflammatory bowel disease and B. dorei and B. vulgatus are implicated in several inflammatory gut diseases such as irritable bowel disease and ulcerative colitis,' the researchers write in their study. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii - found in chicory, wheat, onion, banana, garlic and leek The amount of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is increased by a molecule called inulin. Inulin is a polysaccharide which means it is various sugar molecules bonded together. Inulin is naturally-occurring in wheat, onion, banana, garlic, and leek. However, it is abundant in chicory and has been extracted on an industrial scale and turned into a supplement. Inulin powder and capsules can be bought off the shelf from Holland and Barrett, and other retailers. Bifidobacterium bifidum - found in fermented food, whole grains and prebiotics Growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum is promoted by fibre and also fermented products such as kombucha, kefir and kimchi. Whole grains and polyphenols (found in cocoa, red wine, grape skins and almonds) have also been found to improve production of Bifidobacteria. Off-the shelf prebiotic supplements are also believed to boost the amount of Bifidiobacteria in the gut. Ruminococcus gnavus - can be reduced by eating apples and pears According to a 2016 study, apples and pears are good at reducing levels of R. gnavus. 'Our finding that total fruit and apple/pear serve intakes were both shown to be negatively associated with the relative abundance of species related to R. gnavus is somewhat surprising,' researchers write in the study. Ruminococcus torques - can be reduced by earing fruit The above study says their 'surprising' finding is backed up by research, also published in 2016, which looked at almost 1,200 adults. 'A recent large Dutch population based study... found that fruit intake was negatively associated with the abundance of the closely related R. torques,' the study says. Bacteroides dorei - source unknown This bacteria was only discovered in 2016 when it was found in the faeces of humans. It is able to feed off a wide variety of sugars and due to it only recently being discovered there is little information available as to what foods cause higher or lower levels of the bacteria.

'In light of reports that a subset of recovered patients with COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnoea [breathlessness] and joint pains, some over 80 days after initial onset of symptoms, we posit that the dysbiotic gut microbiome could contribute to immune-related health problems post-COVID-19,' the authors write in their paper, published in the journal Gut.

Blood samples revealed this microbial imbalance was also linked to higher levels of cytokines, small molecules which are a natural part of the immune response but can cause damage if not properly regulated.

How tocilizumab and sarilumab work The two drugs tocilizumab and sarilumab are anti inflammatory. They are currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and similar conditions. In Covid patients they inhibit a specific part of the immune system which occurs when the body goes haywire and attacks itself. it stops little molecules called interleukin 6 (IL-6) from latching on to their receptors. Normally, when they bind to the receptors they cause it to die, which leads to significant damage. In Covid patients this happens in the lungs and airways and leads to respiratory issues. By getting in the way of this pathway the drugs allow the body to retain its natural immune response equilibrium and improve a patient's condition. Advertisement

A hallmark of severe Covid is the immune system going haywire following coronavirus infection and, in severe cases, attacking healthy cells and tissues.

This so-called 'cytokine storm' sees the small molecules pumped out in vast quantities as their regulatory system is broken and they go on to wreak havoc.

This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially fatal condition.

If a patient's condition deteriorates to this point, it is difficult to intervene and, as a result, preventing cytokine storms has become a primary focus of coronavirus drug trials.

Two such treatments, anti-inflammatories called tocilizumab and sarilumab which are currently used to treat arthritis, were recently approved for use in intensive care on Covid-19 patients by the NHS.

Recent results from the REMAP-CAP clinical trial showed people who only received dexamethasone in intensive care had a death rate of 35.8 per cent. This dropped to just 25.3 per cent when they were also given either tocilizumab or sarilumab.

The latest study was observational and is unable to say if Covid-19 changes the gut microbiome, or a weakened microbiome leads to more severe infection.

However, a separate study by South Korean researchers, published in Mbio, although only a review, indicates the latter option is the most likely.

Research from South Korea found people with a poorly functioning gut are more likely to develop severe Covid-19 because the lack of healthy microbes makes it easier for the virus to infect cells in the digestive tract (stock)

Academics at Korea University's Laboratory for Human-Microbial Interactions analysed data from various studies which looked at the impact of poor gut health on coronavirus infection.

Dr Heenam Stanley Kim, who led the review, believes there is now substantial evidence to back up the claims that gut microbiome pays an integral role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Dr Kim says a dysfunctional gut may exacerbate the severity of infection because lower microbial levels make it easier for the coronavirus to reach the surface of the digestive tract and internal organs.

These organs have a receptor on their surface called ACE2 and this protruding protein is what the virus hijacks in order to gain access to a cell. it is found in high quantities in the lungs and respiratory tract as well as the digestive system.

'There seems to be a clear connection between the altered gut microbiome and severe COVID-19,' Dr Kim said.

Gut microbiome is highly sensitive and reacts based on a person's health, diet and environment.

Scientists continue to learn more about importance but it is known that people with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes have an imbalanced microbiome.

Older people are at the highest risk of dying from Covid-19 — the CDC in the US says over-85s are 630 times more likely to die from Covid-19 infection than a person aged between 18 and 29 — and also often suffer with poorly functioning microbiomes, Dr Kim says.",MailOnline,"['immune', 'levels', 'affects', 'patients', 'study', 'severe', 'microbiome', 'covid19', 'ruminococcus', 'bacteria', 'severity', 'gut']",0

Israel has vaccinated more than 20 percent of its population against COVID-19, leaving the rest of the world - including the US and the UK - in its dust.

The small nation has deployed its military to help run mass vaccination sites 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

As a result, it has vaccinated 1.8 million out of its population of 8.65 million residents, according to data tracking by Bloomberg News - and Israel began its vaccine rollout about a week after the US and the UK did.

The US lags shamefully behind. With 8.02 million doses administered, according to Bloomberg tracking, less than 2.5 percent of all Americans have been vaccinated through a disjointed set of state-run programs, which are so rigid that doses go unused because an 'eligible' recipient can't be found, as happened in New York.

Some elite institutions rare going rogue, however, with vaccines going to young programmers and graduates who are far from the front lines at places like Columbia University, New York University and Vanderbilt University, the New York Times revealed.

Vaccination is struggling to keep up with the spread of the virus in the US. Nearly 214,000 new cases were reported yesterday, as well as 3,233 deaths, bringing the total fatalities to nearly 375,000. More than 22 million Americans have been infected.

While Israel is moving onto second doses for nearly all its highest priority groups, the US has only administered some 150,000 second doses, according to the Times.

Only an average of about 200,000 Americans have received vaccines a day since the rollout started on December 14 (though the pace is gradually picking up) with more doses shipped to states than they can work out how to give, with West Virginia and South Dakota leading the pack and vaccinating five percent of their populations, while Mississippi, Alabama and Nevada struggle to make it over one percent.

The UK has the opposite problem. Vaccination sites hope to give a jab every 45 seconds - but keep running out of doses. Just three percent of people there have been vaccinated - only slight ahead of the US rate.

By contrast, Israel vaccinated more than 300,000 people in the last 24 hours, according to Our World in Data.

What distinguishes Israel's plan? It still aims to get the shot to the most vulnerable people first, but has defined that broadly - including anyone over 60, health care workers and anyone with underlying conditions, a highly-coordinated effort and an information campaign that generated trust among even hard-to-reach groups, an official told CNBC.

Israel has raced ahead of the rest of the world in its effort to vaccinate its population. Already, 20% of people there (top, yellow) have had at least one dose, while fewer than 2.5% of people in the US have had theirs (lavender)

BEST AND WORST: States with flexible plans, like West Virginia and the Dakotas (dark red) have vaccinated about five percent of their populations, while Alabama, Nevada and Louisiana have barely surpassed one percent of the state vaccinated

The US quickly shipped out doses of its vaccines, with more than 22 million distributed, but many states, including California, Texas and Florida have more than a million doses sitting unused

WHAT IS ISRAEL DOING RIGHT? A NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND A BROAD GROUP OF TOP-PRIORITY VACCINE RECIPIENTS ARE SETTING ITS FAST PACE

Israel's small size gives it an immediate leg-up in the race to get citizens vaccinated.

With 331 million people living in the US, the American initiative has more than 38-times as many people to vaccinate as Israel.

But the smaller nation also has nationalized health systems and a unified method for tracking medical records and vaccines.

Israel's system for registering everyone's health information makes it far easier to notify people that it's their turn to get shots and when it's time to come for a booster vaccine.

Already, Israel has vaccinated almost all of its highest-priority residents - a broad group that includes over-60s, health care workers and those with underlying conditions.

Elderly inmates are the only group listed as high-priority who have not widely already received their first shots, according to the Jerusalem Post.

The country is well-positioned to hit its goal of vaccinating two million people by the end of January.

At long last, the US is setting up mass 'vaccination superstations' like this one in San Diego in an effort to speed the rollout

Israel considered all people over 75 to be top-priority, meaning it was able to quickly roll out its vaccines in organized, drive-thru sites

The pace of Israel's vaccine rollout has only increased week over week, while other nations' programs remain flat

In fact, the rollout of its vaccine doses went so smoothly that it was desperate to buy more to keep up its breakneck pace.

Another 700,000 doses are due to arrive in Israel on Monday, facilitating its plan to expand vaccinations to people 55 and older.

On Tuesday, teachers will be able to get first vaccinations too, so long as they present a recent pay slip.

One criticism of Israel has been leveled against it by human rights groups: Israel is not including nearly five million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in its vaccination plan, despite the wild-fire spread of coronavirus cases in the latter, according to the Washington Post.

WHAT IS THE US DOING WRONG? 50 DIFFERENT PLANS AND RIGID PLANS IN STATES LIKE NY HAVE SEEN JUST 2.5% OF AMERICANS VACCINATED

Americans are furious over the glacial pace of the US COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Only eight million people have gotten their first vaccine doses according to Bloomberg's tracker.

That is a sorry showing, considering that Operation Warp Speed officials spent months promising that 20 million people would get their first doses before the end of 2020.

Now, nearly two weeks into 2021, fewer than half that many doses have been given out.

More than 22.1 million doses have been distributed to states, but in most they have hit massive bottlenecks.

New York, for example, has given out just 46 percent of the 1.2 million doses sent there by the federal government.

Governor Andrew Cuomo, who became something of a self-appointed poster boy for COVID-19 pandemic response after New York got its massive outbreak under control, came under fire last week for the poor rollout of vaccines in his state.

New York's vaccination plan was so rigid about giving out no doses to lower priority groups until all health care workers had gotten theirs that four doses had to be thrown out in Harlem last week, and the rollout slowed to a crawl.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo finally said Friday he would expand vaccine eligibility to over-75s, first responders and transit workers, beginning Monday

Uncertainty still looms about who qualified and lines for vaccination hundreds of people long stretch down New York City blocks

Under pressure from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and public health experts - not to mention his constituents - Cuomo finally announced the expansion of eligibility to all New Yorkers 75 or older, teachers and school staff, first responders like firefighters and police and transit workers.

The rule-change took effect Monday.

New York City also set up mass vaccination locations over the weekend, in Brooklyn and the Bronx, which opened Sunday.

The mass sites were open for part of the day on Sunday before they start operating round the clock, seven days a week on Monday as part of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's push to set up 250 vaccination locations to meet the ambitious goal of inoculating one million New Yorkers by the end of the month.

Three other smaller sites also opened on Sunday in Brooklyn, the Bronx and in Queens.

In New York, like in much of the United States, efforts to get the two vaccines that have so far been authorized into the arms of Americans have moved slower than hoped due to a slew of issues.

They included strict rules controlling who should get inoculated first, with some healthcare workers at the front of the line declining the shots, and a lack of planning or direction on the federal level.

As of early Sunday, New York City had administered 203,181 doses of the vaccines to its residents out of more than 524,000 doses that have been delivered, data from the city's health department showed.

By Monday morning, 400 NYPD officers had already gotten their first shots, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in a statement.

US BEGINS TO WIDEN PRIORITY GROUPS TO SPEED VACCINATIONS - BUT STATES LIKE WEST VIRGINIA ARE AHEAD OF THE CURVE

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said healthcare workers and nursing home residents and staff should have priority for the limited supply of vaccines.

The agency softened that guidance on Friday, recommending that states move to those next on the list - people over age 75 and so called 'essential' workers - to accelerate lagging vaccination programs.

Some states, including West Virginia North Dakota and Connecticut, foresaw the need for flexible vaccination plans.

West Virginia has used more than 70 percent of its vaccine doses and vaccinated five percent of its population - about twice the rate the US is vaccinating people as a whole.

It, like Connecticut, considered a broad swath of people eligible in the first wave of vaccines. West Virginia has also tapped up local, trusted pharmacies to vaccinate nursing home patients, while every other state is doing so through the federal partnerships with Walgreens and CVS.

At elite institutions like Vanderbilt University (front-line staff members pictured after getting their COVID-19 shots) are giving shots to staff members who are not front line workers as well, in an effort to speed the rollout and avoid wasting doses, though the Tennessee health department says the doses should got to other priority groups

Connecticut considered everyone from health care workers to school custodians to-priority vaccine recipients. Crucially, when on vaccination site has leftover doses, the state has a plan to redistribute those to another, to ensure they don't go to waste.

Connecticut ranks fifth in the nation, using up 65 percent of the doses allocated to it and has vaccinated 3.26 percent of its population against COVID-19.

At the back of the pack are Arkansas, Massachusetts and Mississippi. They have each used just a third of their vaccine doses.

North Carolina and Virginia both set one-day records for new cases on Saturday. They are among 22 states that have set records for daily infections this month, and health experts warn new variants of the virus may lead to an even greater surge in infections.

A highly transmissible variant of the novel coronavirus first detected in the United Kingdom in December has now been found in at least nine US states, adding further urgency to the push to vaccinate more people.

Dr Scott Gottlieb, former head of the US Food and Drug Administration who sits on the board of Pfizer Inc which makes one of the U.S. authorized vaccines, warned of the need for a better system to detect and combat new COVID-19 variants from the UK and South Africa.

'We're going to have to update our vaccines and our antibody drugs and other therapeutics regularly to keep up with these new variants as they emerge,' Gottlieb said in an interview with CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday.",MailOnline,"['rate', 'workers', 'population', '10times', 'israel', 'states', 'health', 'doses', 'million', 'york', 'vaccine', 'vaccinated', 'vaccines', 'vaccination']",0
2021-01-11 20:30:06+00:00,14,"China has said scientists from the World Health Organisation investigating the origins of Covid-19 will be allowed into the country on Thursday.

On their arrival, the experts will meet with Chinese counterparts, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a one-sentence statement that gave no other details.

The international community is hoping the experts can visit the 'wet market' where the virus is believed to have emerged and retrace in detail those early days of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

But the NHC declined to provide the team's itinerary and it was not immediately clear whether the scientists would be travelling to Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected a year ago.

The brief announcement comes after China initially banned WHO experts from entering the country last week, sparking accusations of a cover-up.

China has been accused of initially covering up the outbreak that first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, which critics say delayed China's initial response and allowed COVID-19 to spread globally.

China's position on the hunt for the origins of the pandemic 'has always been open and responsible', said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying last week.

But today, the Chinese government decided to allow the experts into the country.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China had approved the visit following consultations between the sides and called it an opportunity to 'exchange views with Chinese scientists and medical experts on scientific cooperation on the tracing of the origin of the new coronavirus.'

'Along with continuous changes in the epidemic situation, our knowledge of the virus deepens, and more early cases are discovered,' Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the search for the origin will likely involve 'multiple countries and localities.'

The Chinese government has been strictly controlling all research at home into the origins of the virus, an Associated Press investigation found, and state-owned media have played up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere.

The culture of secrecy is believed to have delayed warnings about the pandemic, blocked the sharing of information with the WHO and hampered early testing.

Australia and other countries have called for an investigation into the origins of the virus, prompting angry responses from Beijing.

There was no immediate comment from the WHO on Monday's announcement, but U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric had earlier told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 'is fully supportive of Dr. Tedros' and WHO's efforts to get a team in there.'

'It's very important that as the WHO is in the lead in fighting the pandemic, that it also has a leading role in trying to look back at the roots of this pandemic so we can be better prepared for the next one,' Dujarric said.

'We very much hope' that China's reported comments that it is working with the WHO and looking for a smooth visit 'will happen.'

The virus' origins have been the source of intense speculation, much of it centered around the likelihood that it was carried by bats and passed to humans through an intermediary species sold as food or medicine in traditional Chinese wet markets.

China has largely stemmed new cases of domestic transmission, but the government said today that scores of people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Hebei province, bordering Beijing.

Today, Wuhan was forced to shut its markets once again and launched a mass-testing campaign after two people from China's new Covid-19 epicentre in the northern Hebei province near Beijing visited the city before testing positive, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

China's disease experts are currently busy with multiple small-scale clusters and outbreaks reported in the past couple of weeks, Ms Hua said last week.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China had approved the visit following consultations between the sides and called it an opportunity to 'exchange views with Chinese scientists and medical experts on scientific cooperation on the tracing of the origin of the new coronavirus.'

'Along with continuous changes in the epidemic situation, our knowledge of the virus deepens, and more early cases are discovered,' Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the search for the origin will likely involve 'multiple countries and localities.'

The Chinese government has been strictly controlling all research at home into the origins of the virus, an Associated Press investigation found, and state-owned media have played up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere.

The culture of secrecy is believed to have delayed warnings about the pandemic, blocked the sharing of information with the WHO and hampered early testing.

Australia and other countries have called for an investigation into the origins of the virus, prompting angry responses from Beijing.

There was no immediate comment from the WHO on Monday's announcement, but U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric had earlier told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 'is fully supportive of Dr. Tedros' and WHO's efforts to get a team in there.'

'It's very important that as the WHO is in the lead in fighting the pandemic, that it also has a leading role in trying to look back at the roots of this pandemic so we can be better prepared for the next one,' Dujarric said.

'We very much hope' that China's reported comments that it is working with the WHO and looking for a smooth visit 'will happen.'

The virus' origins have been the source of intense speculation, much of it centered around the likelihood that it was carried by bats and passed to humans through an intermediary species sold as food or medicine in traditional Chinese wet markets.

China has largely stemmed new cases of domestic transmission, but the government said today that scores of people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Hebei province, bordering Beijing.

Today, Wuhan was forced to shut its markets once again and launched a mass-testing campaign after two people from China's new Covid-19 epicentre in the northern Hebei province near Beijing visited the city before testing positive, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

China's disease experts are currently busy with multiple small-scale clusters and outbreaks reported in the past couple of weeks, Ms Hua said last week.

'Our experts are wholeheartedly in the stressful battle to control the epidemic,' she said.

The outbreaks comes amid measures to curb the further spread of the virus during next month's Lunar New Year holiday. Authorities have called on citizens not to travel, ordered schools closed a week early and conducted testing on a massive scale.

China has recorded 87,536 total cases of the virus, including 4,634 deaths. Hospitals are currently treating 673 people for COVID-19, while 506 others are in isolation and under observation after testing positive without showing symptoms., officials said.

The Hebei outbreak has raised particular concern because of the province's proximity to Beijing. Parts of the province are under lockdown and interprovincial travel has been largely cut off, with those entering Beijing to work having to show proof of employment and a clean bill of health.

On their arrival, the experts will meet with Chinese counterparts, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a one-sentence statement that gave no other details.

The international community is hoping the experts can visit the 'wet market' where the virus is believed to have emerged and retrace in detail those early days of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

But the NHC declined to provide the team's itinerary and it was not immediately clear whether the scientists would be travelling to Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected a year ago.

The brief announcement comes after China initially banned WHO experts from entering the country last week, sparking accusations of a cover-up.

China has been accused of initially covering up the outbreak that first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, which critics say delayed China's initial response and allowed COVID-19 to spread globally.

China's position on the hunt for the origins of the pandemic 'has always been open and responsible', said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying last week.

The pandemic has so far broadly been brought to heel by Chinese authorities since its emergence in Wuhan in late 2019, with small outbreaks swiftly snuffed out using mass testing, local lockdowns and travel restrictions.

But Hebei province in northern China has seen 127 new Covid-19 cases, plus an additional 183 asymptomatic infections, in the past week.

The vast majority were found in Shijiazhuang, a city of several million in Hebei province whose surrounding areas take the total population to 11million. Nine confirmed cases were in the neighbouring city of Xingtai, whose area covers 7million people.

Residents of Shijiazhuang and Xingtai - situated some 80 miles apart - were banned from leaving unless absolutely necessary, Hebei authorities announced on Friday.

The Chinese National Health Commission has reported 53 confirmed cases for Thursday, including 37 native patients and 16 imported infections. Among the local cases, 33 were detected in Hebei.

City-wide mass testing drives started on Monday from Shijiazhuang's Gaocheng District, the epicentre of the Hebei outbreak.

As of Friday noon, all of the district's 673,787 residents had been tested and 511,219 swab samples had been analysed by labs, which found 259 positive cases, the city's vice mayor Meng Xianghong said at a press briefing.

Mass-testing campaigns in Shijiazhuang's other districts are still ongoing.

Officials vowed to 'strictly control the movement of people and vehicles', with all residential estates placed under 'closed management' -- a euphemism for lockdown.

Hebei residents were also banned from entering Beijing or leaving the province unless absolutely necessary.

Chinese officials have repeatedly tried to link recurrent domestic outbreaks to strains of the virus circulating overseas, suggesting that it has been brought back into China by returning travellers and contaminated imported food packaging.

There are mounting fears travel plans for hundreds of millions of people for the Lunar New Year may be ruined as virus controls tighten.

Officials are starting to signal a low-key new-year holiday -- which will run from February 11 to 17 -- nixing the prospect of banquets, parties and public celebrations.

'Mass celebrations, gatherings and fairs are forbidden,' said Kang Sen, of Beijing's agriculture and rural affairs authority, adding even funerals should be 'brief' and all public events would need prior approval.

His comments, carried over state media, appeared directed at villages in areas around the capital rather than the city itself.

In the two Hebei cities under the spotlight, restrictions were tightened Friday.

Long-distance passenger vehicle transport in both cities was suspended and highways closed.

The Chinese National Health Commission has reported 53 confirmed cases for Thursday, including 37 native patients and 16 imported infections. Among the local cases, 33 were detected in Hebei.

City-wide mass testing drives started on Monday from Shijiazhuang's Gaocheng District, the epicentre of the Hebei outbreak.

As of Friday noon, all of the district's 673,787 residents had been tested and 511,219 swab samples had been analysed by labs, which found 259 positive cases, the city's vice mayor Meng Xianghong said at a press briefing.

Mass-testing campaigns in Shijiazhuang's other districts are still ongoing.

'The outbreak was imported from abroad, but the exact origins are currently under in-depth investigation by state, provincial and municipal experts,' said a Hebei health official. The above picture shows workers producing face masks in Qinhuangdao, Hebei, on January 8

Officials vowed to 'strictly control the movement of people and vehicles', with all residential estates placed under 'closed management' -- a euphemism for lockdown.

Hebei residents were also banned from entering Beijing or leaving the province unless absolutely necessary.

'The outbreak was imported from abroad, but the exact origins are currently under in-depth investigation by state, provincial and municipal experts,' said Li Qi, head of the Hebei Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing Friday.

Chinese officials have repeatedly tried to link recurrent domestic outbreaks to strains of the virus circulating overseas, suggesting that it has been brought back into China by returning travellers and contaminated imported food packaging.

There are mounting fears travel plans for hundreds of millions of people for the Lunar New Year may be ruined as virus controls tighten.

Officials are starting to signal a low-key new-year holiday -- which will run from February 11 to 17 -- nixing the prospect of banquets, parties and public celebrations.

'Mass celebrations, gatherings and fairs are forbidden,' said Kang Sen, of Beijing's agriculture and rural affairs authority, adding even funerals should be 'brief' and all public events would need prior approval.

His comments, carried over state media, appeared directed at villages in areas around the capital rather than the city itself.

In the two Hebei cities under the spotlight, restrictions were tightened Friday.

Long-distance passenger vehicle transport in both cities was suspended and highways closed.

2021-01-08 01:30:02+00:00,16,"People who carry a version of a gene inherited from Neanderthals are at lower risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, a new study has found.

The gene, known as OAS1, was incorporated into the human genome after our ancestors mated with the now-extinct human relative around 60,000 years ago.

The OAS1 gene controls a protein of the same name, which is involved in the body's response to viruses.

The version inherited from Neanderthals is less common in society, but offers increased protection against the coronavirus, researchers say.

The finding contradicts previous research, which found a cluster of inherited Neanderthal genes can increase the risk of getting severely ill from Covid-19.

A specific version of a gene, known as OAS1, which was inherited from Neanderthals reduces the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, a new study has found

The study, led by McGill University in Canada, looked in detail at the genetic code that produces different versions of OAS1.

One position within the gene, known as rs10774671, has two main forms. The most common form is variant 'A' but the ancestral version from Neanderthals is dubbed variant 'G'.

'The ancestral variant (rs10774671-G) is the major allele in African populations and became fixed in Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes,' the researchers write.

The difference between the two gene variants is that A leads to lots of different types (or isoforms) of OAS1 protein being produced in varying quantities, whereas type G leads to a large amount of one specific isoform of the OAS1 protein, called p46.

'How much each of us has of either isoform seems to be determined by a single change in the genetic code of the protein-encoding gene, that is, the region in the genome containing the blueprint to build this protein,' study author Dr Maik Pietzner from the University of Cambridge told MailOnline.

The p46 version of the protein is longer than the others, and has higher antiviral activity than other types of OAS1, the researchers say.

When people have high levels of the p46 version of OAS1, which is made by the Neanderthal gene, they have less than one third of the risk of getting infected as someone with low levels of p46 OAS1, the data suggests.

And if they do get infected, these people have just nine per cent of the risk of hospitalisation and and five per cent of the risk of developing 'very severe' Covid as someone with low levels of p46.

This gene embedded itself in human genomes after our ancestors mated with the now-extinct human relative that lived around 60,000 years ago

The G form of the gene originally came into Homo sapiens via our predecessor's dalliances with our sister species millennia ago, and has survived to this day.

It lasted for so long because of its ability to fight off diseases, offering a survival benefit.

'This protective form of OAS1 is present in sub-Saharan Africans but was lost when the ancestors of modern-day Europeans migrated out of Africa,' study co-author Brent Richards from the Jewish General Hospital and McGill University in Montreal, told Reuters.

'It was then re-introduced into the European population through mating with Neanderthals.'

The researchers believe that drugs which target the OAS1 gene and increase the amount of p46 in the system could lead to an effective treatment for Covid-19.

A previous study from the University of Edinburgh identified five genes that can negatively influence a patient's chances of survival after catching Covid-19.

One of these was common version of OAS1 (variant A), reinforcing the suggestion that the type of OAS1 gene a person inherits can play a significant role in disease progression and severity.

Meanwhile, a previous study found that some genes inherited from Neanderthals may have a negative impact on coronavirus patients' chances of survival.

Researchers from Germany and Sweden found a specific cluster of Neanderthal genes had been linked to an increased risk of Covid-19 death.

In a study of 3,199 hospital patients with the coronavirus in Italy and Spain, they discovered that this genetic signature was linked to more severe illness.

2021-01-06 22:58:37+00:00,32,"China has denied entry to a team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts who were due to arrive in the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus.

The news comes amid growing suspicions of a cover-up in the country where Covid-19 is believed to have originated at the end of 2019, although its origins remain bitterly contested as China remains determined to control the narrative.

The head of the World Health Organisation says he was 'disappointed' that Chinese officials have not finalised permissions for the arrival of the team of experts.

A year after the outbreak started, WHO experts were due in China for a highly politicised visit to explore the origins of the coronavirus, in a trip trailed by accusations of cover-ups, conspiracy and fears of a whitewash.

The WHO said China granted permission for a visit by its experts, with a 10-person team expected to arrive this week - but before most could even begin their journeys they faced roadblocks, with Beijing yet to grant them entry.

The WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a 'logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.'

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.

'Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China,' he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.

'I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,' Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.

He added that he has 'been in contact with senior Chinese officials' and that he had 'once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.

'I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We're eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,' he said.

Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.

Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China's borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.

But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative.

An international expert team has set off for China to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Beijing has yet to provide the necessary access. Pictured: A TV grab taken on January 5, 2021 showing WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a press briefing on Covid-19, during which he criticised China for not allowing the team entry

The WHO team has promised to focus on the science, specifically how the coronavirus jumped from animals - believed to be bats - to humans.

'This is not about finding a guilty country or a guilty authority,' Fabian Leendertz from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's central disease control body who will be among the team to visit, told AFP new agency in late December.

'This is about understanding what happened to avoid that in the future, to reduce the risk.'

But doubt has been cast over what the WHO mission can reasonably expect to achieve and the state pressure they will face, raising fears that the mission will serve to rubber stamp China's official story, not challenge it.

The upcoming visit will not be the first time Covid-19 has brought WHO teams to China. A mission last year looked at the response by authorities rather than the virus origins, with another in the summer laying the groundwork for the upcoming probe.

But this time the WHO will wade into a swamp of competing interests, stuck between accusatory Western nations and a Chinese leadership determined to show that its secretive and hierarchical political system served to stem, not spread, the outbreak.

It is unclear who the experts will be able to meet when they arrive in Wuhan to retrace the initial days and weeks of the pandemic.

Inside China, whistleblowers have been silenced and citizen journalists jailed, including a 37-year-old woman imprisoned last week for four years over video reports from the city during its prolonged lockdown.

Outside, responsibility for the virus has been weaponized.

From the outset, US President Donald Trump used the virus as political bludgeon against big power rival China.

He accused Beijing of trying to hide the outbreak of what he dubbed the 'China virus' and repeated unsubstantiated rumours it leaked from a Wuhan lab.

Trump then pulled the US out of the WHO, accusing it of going soft on China, a nation with which he was also engaged in a bitter trade war.

Critics say that blizzard of accusations sought to divert attention from Washington's bungled response to a crisis which has so far killed more than 355,000 Americans.

Without them, said one, 'a lot of these situations that we had in January 2020 would not have played out the way it did.'

'It is the geopolitics that... put the world in this situation,' Ilona Kickbusch, of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, told AFP.

China has since deftly reframed its version of events, hailing its 'extraordinary success' in curbing the pandemic within its borders and rebooting its economy.

Beijing now says it will ride to the rescue of poorer nations, promising cheap vaccines and seeding doubt that the virus even originated in China.

Chinese doctors were recording at least DOUBLE the number of coronavirus cases that Beijing was reporting to the world in February, leaked documents revealed in December China under-reported its coronavirus cases and deaths by up to half during the early stages of the pandemic, leaked documents revealed in December. Beijing has long been accused of under-reporting its coronavirus numbers, but the data gives an idea of the scale of the problem for the first time. For example, on February 10 China reported 2,478 new cases of the virus across the entire country - but leaked data shows that, on the same date, Hubei province alone logged 5,918 cases. Meanwhile on March 7, Hubei was officially reporting a cumulative death toll of 2,986, but documents show it actually stood at 3,456. The official figures, which were reported across the world, downplayed the severity of the outbreak at a time when world leaders were trying to devise their own response strategies - leaving many unprepared for what was to come. China was able to use the figures and its authoritarian powers to lock down hard and early, all-but wiping the virus out and meaning its economy has grown this year, while under-prepared western democracies have seen their economies devastated. On February 10, China reported a total of 2,478 cases in its daily report, which was published around the world. Leaked documents show the total was 5,918 in Hubei province alone On February 17, the province of Hubei reported 93 new deaths to the public. In fact, documents show that it was 196 Other discrepancies revealed in the data include February 17, when Hubei officially reported 93 deaths from the virus while the documents show a toll of 196. On March 7, Hubei officially reported 83 cases, but 115 are recorded in the leaked papers. Another report also records the deaths of six health care workers from coronavirus by February 10, which were never publicly disclosed. Data also suggests that the number of cases recorded in 2019, when the virus first emerged, was 200. Until now, China has only publicly acknowledged 44 cases in 2019 - which it reported to the WHO as 'a pneumonia of unknown etiology' on January 3. The documents, comprising 117 pages, were handed to CNN by a whistleblower inside the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which was at the epicentre of the outbreak. The whistleblower described themselves as 'a patriot' who was 'motivated to expose a truth that had been censored, and honor colleagues who had also spoken out.' Alongside the true case and death tolls, the documents reveal for the first time that Hubei was in the midst of a major flu epidemic at the time coronavirus struck. By March 7, Hubei had officially logged 2,986 deaths from the virus, but leaked documents show that toll was actually 3,456 On March 7, Hubei province - where epicentre Wuhan was located - reported 83 new infections to the public. Leaked documents give a figure of 115 The province was reporting up to 20 times the normal number of seasonal flu cases in December 2019, centered in the cities of Yichang and Xianning. Wuhan, where coronavirus would first emerge, was third worst-affected. Data also shows that a large number of flu cases, including in Wuhan, were diagnosed as 'unknown cause' - dating a far back as December 2. Researchers told CNN that it is possible some of these were mis-diagnosed coronavirus cases, but there is no way to know for sure because the data is simply not available. Dr. Amesh Adalja, at Johns Hopkins University which has been at the forefront of tracking the virus, said: 'They were only testing for what they knew.' China claims it has done studies looking for cases of coronavirus in Wuhan before December 2019, but has been unable to find any. While there is no suggestion that the outbreaks are linked, the flu epidemic likely left health officials stretched and unprepared for the emergence of a new illness. The documents also reveal a shambles among China's early testing regime, which contributed to the cases being under-reported. According to the data, nucleic acid tests which were initially used to diagnose the virus only worked between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the time. Documents also reveal Hubei province was in the midst of a flu epidemic when coronavirus emerged, with hospitals under-funded and staff demoralised (file image) That meant scientists were often forced to use other methods - such as scans of the lungs - to diagnose patients they were sure had the virus, but whose tests kept coming back negative. But because of the way China's reporting system worked, only those cases which had been confirmed by the test were publicly reported. All other cases were marked down as 'suspected' or 'clinically diagnosed'. While bureaucrats would have been aware of both figures, and may have been aware of the problems with testing, they chose only to report cases with a positive test - at least initially. China did start adding 'clinically diagnosed' cases to its totals in mid-February, but by then the virus had already spread far beyond its own borders. Yanzhong Huang, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specilaises in Chinese public health, told CNN: 'It was clear they did make mistakes. 'Not just mistakes that happen when you're dealing with a novel virus, also bureaucratic and politically-motivated errors in how they handled it. 'These had global consequences.' The early testing regime also suffered huge delays, with the average time taken from the onset of disease to diagnosis being 23 days. That meant China's official daily totals were lagging three weeks behind reality, while at the same time hampering its own ability to respond to the crisis. Internal documents also show that Hubei health authorities were under-funded and suffering staff motivation issues when the pandemic struck. And while Beijing boasted that it had massively invested in early-stage detection of infectious diseases in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, in reality the system was slow, under-funded, and weighed down with bureaucracy.

The world must investigate all the mounting evidence Covid leaked from a Wuhan lab, writes IAN BIRRELL

By Ian Birrell for the Mail on Sunday

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Yet we still know little about how and why the virus spread with such devastating consequences.

It can almost certainly be traced to bats. But we do not know how this pathogen – having evolved an extraordinary ability to infect, causing such damage to different bodily organs – made the jump into human beings.

At last, a World Health Organisation investigation is under way into the origins of the coronavirus, but it is accused of meekly pandering to China's agenda by recruiting patsy scientists and relying on Beijing's dubious data.

Now there is growing clamour from experts around the world that no stone should be left unturned during this inquiry – and that it must include one key element of a hunt which has all the hallmarks of a thriller novel.

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan, writes Ian Birrell. Pictured: Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli, who was dubbed 'Batwoman', at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

Why did China build a virus lab in Wuhan? Chinese officials decided to build the Wuhan Institute of Virology after the country was ravaged by an outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003. SARS, another kind of coronavirus, killed 775 people and infected more than 8,000 globally in an epidemic that lasted about eight months. It took the Chinese 15 years to fully complete the project, which cost a total of 300million yuan (£34million). The French helped design the building. Its crown jewel is a four-storey lab with the highest biosafety level of P4. It's the most advanced laboratory of its type in China. Construction of the lab was finished in 2015 and it officially opened on January 5, 2018, after passing various safety inspections. Describing the significance of the P4 lab, China Youth Online billed it as the 'aircraft carrier of China's virology'. The state-run newspaper said it 'is capable of researching the deadliest pathogens'. One researcher, Zhou Peng, told state news agency Xinhua in 2018: 'We are proud to say that we are already at the forefront in the field of studying the immunity mechanism of bats, which carry viruses for a long time. 'Bats carry viruses but are not infected [by them]. [They] provide hope for mankind to study how to fight viruses.' Advertisement

This centres on a cave filled with bats, a clutch of mysterious deaths, some brilliant scientists carrying out futuristic experiments in a secretive laboratory – and a cover-up of epic proportions that, if proven, would have huge consequences for the Chinese Communist Party and the global practice of science.

So what, precisely, is this theory on the origins of this pandemic?

It must be stated clearly that it is just a theory, albeit one based on crumbs of evidence teased out by a few courageous scientists and some online detectives.

New diseases have emerged throughout human history. Most experts believe Covid to be a 'zoonotic' disease that spilled over naturally from animals to humans.

They think it was most likely 'amplified' by an intermediate species – similar to how Chinese people's consumption of civet cats sparked the 2002 Sars epidemic.

Yet at the same time, Beijing's actions from the outset – covering up the outbreak, blaming a wild animal market that it has since admitted wasn't at fault, barring outside investigators, burying data and silencing its own experts – have served to fuel suspicions.

Last week, leaked documents exposed how the Chinese government, under orders from President Xi Jinping, is strictly controlling all research into the origins of Covid while promoting fringe theories suggesting it came from outside China.

And it is an uncomfortable coincidence that Wuhan – a city buzzing once again, with busy shops, packed restaurants and many people without masks on the streets celebrating New Year – is home to the world's top coronavirus research unit as well as ground zero to a pandemic from a strange new strain.

The clues start with an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang, a hilly region in Yunnan, southern China, where bats roost in a network of underground caves, cracks and crannies.

Days after three Chinese miners who had been clearing bat droppings inside caves died, Zhengli went to investigate

Two weeks ago, a BBC reporter was prevented from reaching this remote site after being trailed by police for miles along bumpy tracks, then blocked by a lorry and confronted by men at roadblocks saying their job was to stop him.

The previous month, a team of US journalists had also been tailed by plainclothes police who barred their access.

One research team recently managed to take some samples at the mine, but reportedly had them confiscated.

The reason for such secrecy goes back to the end of April 2012 when a 42-year-old man clearing bat droppings in these underground caverns turned up at a nearby hospital with a bad cough, high fever and struggling to breathe.

Within a week, five colleagues had similar symptoms. Three later died, one after doctors spent more than 100 days fighting to save his life – yet the two youngest spent less than a week in the hospital and survived. Sound familiar?

We have since learned from a detailed masters thesis, which included medical reports and radiological scans, that these miners suffered a viral pneumonia, attributed to Sars-like coronaviruses originating from horseshoe bats.

One leading US health body pointed out last year that they had 'an illness remarkably similar to Covid-19'.

Little wonder a prominent vaccine scientist told me: 'This is about as close to a smoking gun as exists.'

Intriguingly, a second thesis three years later also highlighted these cases.

It was written by a student of Oxford-trained virologist Professor George Gao Fu, who is now head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which is leading their response to the pandemic.

So the Chinese authorities must have known about the dead miners.

Yet they quickly tried to blame the wildlife market in Wuhan as Covid's source, until challenged by respected studies revealed in this newspaper.

Following the miners' deaths, Shi Zhengli, a Wuhan-based virologist known as Batwoman for her expeditions to gather samples in such caves and a member of the team that traced the origin of Sars to bats, went to investigate.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats.

The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats. The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

Another expert noted how the miners who died were treated with anti-fungal medications, while those surviving were given other drugs.

'So in addition to the fact that the cases were more Sars-like than fungal-like, this treatment story argues against a fungal [cause],' he said.

'It is very odd that Shi Zhengli would assert these cases were fungal.'

Prof Shi examined samples in her Wuhan lab, a few miles from the infamous market. Studies later found the virus in sewage, but it was not detected in animals.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the first laboratory with the highest global bio-safety level in China.

It specialises in the study of bat-borne viruses and is spearheading China's drive to assert itself in bio-technology.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems.

The institute has carried out experiments on bat coronaviruses since 2015 – including research that can increase their virulence by combining snippets from different strains.

Some viruses were injected into special 'humanised' mice that had been created for use in labs with human genes, cells or tissues in their bodies.

These controversial experiments artificially force the evolution of viruses so as to boost our understanding of diseases and their transmissibility.

They help researchers develop new drugs and vaccines.

The Wuhan scientists were working with prominent Western experts and supported financially by the National Institutes of Health, the most important US funding body – although this relationship was ended on safety grounds after being revealed by The Mail on Sunday.

Some scientists argue this type of pathogen research is too risky since it could trigger a pandemic from a new disease.

As a result, there was a moratorium on such work by the US for four years under the Obama administration.

Other critics have warned that the Wuhan Institute was constructing 'chimeric' coronaviruses – new hybrid micro-organisms that show no sign of human manipulation.

Now the big question is whether they took samples from the coronavirus that killed the Yunnan miners and, back in their laboratory more than 1,000 miles away, created a new virus that somehow leaked out into their own city.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site

As leading experts have suggested, it would have been a logical step to create chimeric viruses by combining properties from different samples.

Many scientific breakthroughs have emerged from such speculative endeavours.

One medical professor suggested to me that the miners may have died after being exposed to very high doses of coronaviruses while working in deep shafts filled with bats and their droppings.

But the Wuhan scientists then struggled to prove causality in their lab as their samples were too weak to infect human cells.

'This would have stopped them publishing a major finding of a new Sars-like virus infecting humans.

The possibility is they might then have tried modifying the virus to make it better able to infect human cells in a bid to establish the missing link.'

This is, it must be stressed, unproven speculation.

And it is understandable why China wants to comprehend as much as possible about bat viruses that emerge in their country.

Yet as experts say, there are many unanswered questions centring on Beijing's reluctance to come clean about the miners' cases, viruses and samples held in their labs.

The Wuhan Institute has even taken key databases offline.

Key to all this is the enigmatic Batwoman, Prof Shi. First, she published a genetic sequence for Sars-Cov-2 – the strain of coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – which, despite close analysis of other novel features, ignored its most surprising characteristic.

This is 'the furin cleavage site', a mutation not found on similar types of coronavirus that allows its spike protein to bind so effectively to many human cells.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems

Then, last January, Prof Shi and two colleagues published a paper in Nature that revealed the existence of a virus called RaTG13 that was taken from a horseshoe bat and stored on their premises, the biggest repository of bat coronaviruses in Asia.

This paper, submitted on the same day China admitted to human transmission, caused a stir in the scientific world since it revealed the existence of the closest known relative to Sars-Cov-2 with more than 96 per cent genetic similarity.

It underlined that such diseases occur in nature – yet although closely related, it would have taken RaTG13 several decades to evolve in the wild into Sars-Cov-2 and was too distant to be manipulated in a laboratory.

Other experts wondered why there was so little information about this new strain. One reason soon became clear: the name had been changed from that of another virus called Ra4991 identified in a previous paper – but, unusually, not cited in the Nature piece.

This obscured a direct link to the dead miners, which was only confirmed when Nature sought publication of an 'addendum' following complaints.

The Wuhan team also admitted it had eight more Sars viruses from the Yunnan mine that have not been disclosed.

Some scientists say these new details raise many fresh issues – including a 20-point critique put on her blog by an Indian microbiologist called Monali Rahalkar.

Many high-profile experts, however, still dismiss the idea of a lab leak as a conspiracy theory.

Yet David Relman, one of the world's leading experts in this field, points out that scientists could easily have combined a 'furin cleavage site' from one viral ancestor with the backbone of Sars-Cov-2 taken from another.

'Alternatively, the complete Sars-Cov-2 sequence could have been recovered from a bat sample and viable virus recreated from a synthetic genome to study it before that virus accidentally escaped,' wrote Relman, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University's medical school, in a recent paper.

The former US government adviser on bio-security told me he raised the issues out of frustration with scientists who seemed discomforted by the idea.

'This perplexing story does not add up – the possibility of a lab accident cannot be discounted,' he said.

There have also been questions over the apparent disappearance of a young woman researcher who worked in the laboratory.

It has been suggested she might have been patient zero of this pandemic, although this has been denied by the Chinese authorities.

Even if the miners' link was eliminated, it would not rule out the possibility of an accident causing this pandemic.

Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said Wuhan scientists have shown in publications that they have sampled hundreds of bats and people living near bat caves in their search for Sars-related viruses.

'Even if the precursor to Sars-Cov-2 was not from these miners or the Mojiang mine, did they find other viruses that are very closely related that we do not yet know about?' she asked.

It sounds like the plot from a science-fiction film: an engineered virus leaking from a high-tech lab to cause global chaos.

Yet there are plenty of precedents, including two researchers infected with Sars in a Beijing virology lab in 2004.

Studies also show accidents with deadly pathogens are common in labs where people are working with microscopic viruses.

Prof Shi admitted she never expected an outbreak in a city so far from the home of the bats she studied.

She said her first thought on hearing coronaviruses might be the culprit was to wonder: 'Could they have come from our lab?'

She then frantically rushed back to Wuhan to check her records for any possible mishandling of materials – which proves she believed such a leak was a possibility.

There is also another lab in Wuhan with a lower level of bio-security, 500 yards from the animal market.

A study posted by two Chinese scientists in February on a site for sharing research – then pulled two days later – enigmatically claimed 605 bats were kept here, describing how some attacked, bled and urinated on a researcher.

'It is plausible that the virus leaked,' the paper concluded.

Perhaps this theory will unravel as we find out fresh facts.

Or scientists will uncover an alternative explanation for the path of Covid-19 from bats to humans.

Equally, it is possible we may never discover the truth about the origins of this virus.

But at this stage the only certainty is that we all do science – and indeed, investigative reporting – a disservice if this idea is discarded without being properly disproved and devoid of evidence.

The WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a 'logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.'

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.

'Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China,' he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.

'I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,' Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.

He added that he has 'been in contact with senior Chinese officials' and that he had 'once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.

'I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We're eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,' he said.

Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.

Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China's borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.

But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative.

The WHO team has promised to focus on the science, specifically how the coronavirus jumped from animals - believed to be bats - to humans.

'This is not about finding a guilty country or a guilty authority,' Fabian Leendertz from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's central disease control body who will be among the team to visit, told AFP new agency in late December.

'This is about understanding what happened to avoid that in the future, to reduce the risk.'

But doubt has been cast over what the WHO mission can reasonably expect to achieve and the state pressure they will face, raising fears that the mission will serve to rubber stamp China's official story, not challenge it.

The upcoming visit will not be the first time Covid-19 has brought WHO teams to China. A mission last year looked at the response by authorities rather than the virus origins, with another in the summer laying the groundwork for the upcoming probe.

But this time the WHO will wade into a swamp of competing interests, stuck between accusatory Western nations and a Chinese leadership determined to show that its secretive and hierarchical political system served to stem, not spread, the outbreak.

It is unclear who the experts will be able to meet when they arrive in Wuhan to retrace the initial days and weeks of the pandemic.

Inside China, whistleblowers have been silenced and citizen journalists jailed, including a 37-year-old woman imprisoned last week for four years over video reports from the city during its prolonged lockdown.

Outside, responsibility for the virus has been weaponized.

From the outset, US President Donald Trump used the virus as political bludgeon against big power rival China.

He accused Beijing of trying to hide the outbreak of what he dubbed the 'China virus' and repeated unsubstantiated rumours it leaked from a Wuhan lab.

Trump then pulled the US out of the WHO, accusing it of going soft on China, a nation with which he was also engaged in a bitter trade war.

Critics say that blizzard of accusations sought to divert attention from Washington's bungled response to a crisis which has so far killed more than 355,000 Americans.

Without them, said one, 'a lot of these situations that we had in January 2020 would not have played out the way it did.'

'It is the geopolitics that... put the world in this situation,' Ilona Kickbusch, of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, told AFP.

China has since deftly reframed its version of events, hailing its 'extraordinary success' in curbing the pandemic within its borders and rebooting its economy.

Beijing now says it will ride to the rescue of poorer nations, promising cheap vaccines and seeding doubt that the virus even originated in China.

Chinese doctors were recording at least DOUBLE the number of coronavirus cases that Beijing was reporting to the world in February, leaked documents revealed in December China under-reported its coronavirus cases and deaths by up to half during the early stages of the pandemic, leaked documents revealed in December. Beijing has long been accused of under-reporting its coronavirus numbers, but the data gives an idea of the scale of the problem for the first time. For example, on February 10 China reported 2,478 new cases of the virus across the entire country - but leaked data shows that, on the same date, Hubei province alone logged 5,918 cases. Meanwhile on March 7, Hubei was officially reporting a cumulative death toll of 2,986, but documents show it actually stood at 3,456. The official figures, which were reported across the world, downplayed the severity of the outbreak at a time when world leaders were trying to devise their own response strategies - leaving many unprepared for what was to come. China was able to use the figures and its authoritarian powers to lock down hard and early, all-but wiping the virus out and meaning its economy has grown this year, while under-prepared western democracies have seen their economies devastated. On February 10, China reported a total of 2,478 cases in its daily report, which was published around the world. Leaked documents show the total was 5,918 in Hubei province alone On February 17, the province of Hubei reported 93 new deaths to the public. In fact, documents show that it was 196 Other discrepancies revealed in the data include February 17, when Hubei officially reported 93 deaths from the virus while the documents show a toll of 196. On March 7, Hubei officially reported 83 cases, but 115 are recorded in the leaked papers. Another report also records the deaths of six health care workers from coronavirus by February 10, which were never publicly disclosed. Data also suggests that the number of cases recorded in 2019, when the virus first emerged, was 200. Until now, China has only publicly acknowledged 44 cases in 2019 - which it reported to the WHO as 'a pneumonia of unknown etiology' on January 3. The documents, comprising 117 pages, were handed to CNN by a whistleblower inside the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which was at the epicentre of the outbreak. The whistleblower described themselves as 'a patriot' who was 'motivated to expose a truth that had been censored, and honor colleagues who had also spoken out.' Alongside the true case and death tolls, the documents reveal for the first time that Hubei was in the midst of a major flu epidemic at the time coronavirus struck. By March 7, Hubei had officially logged 2,986 deaths from the virus, but leaked documents show that toll was actually 3,456 On March 7, Hubei province - where epicentre Wuhan was located - reported 83 new infections to the public. Leaked documents give a figure of 115 The province was reporting up to 20 times the normal number of seasonal flu cases in December 2019, centered in the cities of Yichang and Xianning. Wuhan, where coronavirus would first emerge, was third worst-affected. Data also shows that a large number of flu cases, including in Wuhan, were diagnosed as 'unknown cause' - dating a far back as December 2. Researchers told CNN that it is possible some of these were mis-diagnosed coronavirus cases, but there is no way to know for sure because the data is simply not available. Dr. Amesh Adalja, at Johns Hopkins University which has been at the forefront of tracking the virus, said: 'They were only testing for what they knew.' China claims it has done studies looking for cases of coronavirus in Wuhan before December 2019, but has been unable to find any. While there is no suggestion that the outbreaks are linked, the flu epidemic likely left health officials stretched and unprepared for the emergence of a new illness. The documents also reveal a shambles among China's early testing regime, which contributed to the cases being under-reported. According to the data, nucleic acid tests which were initially used to diagnose the virus only worked between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the time. Documents also reveal Hubei province was in the midst of a flu epidemic when coronavirus emerged, with hospitals under-funded and staff demoralised (file image) That meant scientists were often forced to use other methods - such as scans of the lungs - to diagnose patients they were sure had the virus, but whose tests kept coming back negative. But because of the way China's reporting system worked, only those cases which had been confirmed by the test were publicly reported. All other cases were marked down as 'suspected' or 'clinically diagnosed'. While bureaucrats would have been aware of both figures, and may have been aware of the problems with testing, they chose only to report cases with a positive test - at least initially. China did start adding 'clinically diagnosed' cases to its totals in mid-February, but by then the virus had already spread far beyond its own borders. Yanzhong Huang, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specilaises in Chinese public health, told CNN: 'It was clear they did make mistakes. 'Not just mistakes that happen when you're dealing with a novel virus, also bureaucratic and politically-motivated errors in how they handled it. 'These had global consequences.' The early testing regime also suffered huge delays, with the average time taken from the onset of disease to diagnosis being 23 days. That meant China's official daily totals were lagging three weeks behind reality, while at the same time hampering its own ability to respond to the crisis. Internal documents also show that Hubei health authorities were under-funded and suffering staff motivation issues when the pandemic struck. And while Beijing boasted that it had massively invested in early-stage detection of infectious diseases in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, in reality the system was slow, under-funded, and weighed down with bureaucracy.

The world must investigate all the mounting evidence Covid leaked from a Wuhan lab, writes IAN BIRRELL

By Ian Birrell for the Mail on Sunday

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Yet we still know little about how and why the virus spread with such devastating consequences.

It can almost certainly be traced to bats. But we do not know how this pathogen – having evolved an extraordinary ability to infect, causing such damage to different bodily organs – made the jump into human beings.

At last, a World Health Organisation investigation is under way into the origins of the coronavirus, but it is accused of meekly pandering to China's agenda by recruiting patsy scientists and relying on Beijing's dubious data.

Now there is growing clamour from experts around the world that no stone should be left unturned during this inquiry – and that it must include one key element of a hunt which has all the hallmarks of a thriller novel.

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan, writes Ian Birrell. Pictured: Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli, who was dubbed 'Batwoman', at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

Why did China build a virus lab in Wuhan? Chinese officials decided to build the Wuhan Institute of Virology after the country was ravaged by an outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003. SARS, another kind of coronavirus, killed 775 people and infected more than 8,000 globally in an epidemic that lasted about eight months. It took the Chinese 15 years to fully complete the project, which cost a total of 300million yuan (£34million). The French helped design the building. Its crown jewel is a four-storey lab with the highest biosafety level of P4. It's the most advanced laboratory of its type in China. Construction of the lab was finished in 2015 and it officially opened on January 5, 2018, after passing various safety inspections. Describing the significance of the P4 lab, China Youth Online billed it as the 'aircraft carrier of China's virology'. The state-run newspaper said it 'is capable of researching the deadliest pathogens'. One researcher, Zhou Peng, told state news agency Xinhua in 2018: 'We are proud to say that we are already at the forefront in the field of studying the immunity mechanism of bats, which carry viruses for a long time. 'Bats carry viruses but are not infected [by them]. [They] provide hope for mankind to study how to fight viruses.' Advertisement

This centres on a cave filled with bats, a clutch of mysterious deaths, some brilliant scientists carrying out futuristic experiments in a secretive laboratory – and a cover-up of epic proportions that, if proven, would have huge consequences for the Chinese Communist Party and the global practice of science.

So what, precisely, is this theory on the origins of this pandemic?

It must be stated clearly that it is just a theory, albeit one based on crumbs of evidence teased out by a few courageous scientists and some online detectives.

New diseases have emerged throughout human history. Most experts believe Covid to be a 'zoonotic' disease that spilled over naturally from animals to humans.

They think it was most likely 'amplified' by an intermediate species – similar to how Chinese people's consumption of civet cats sparked the 2002 Sars epidemic.

Yet at the same time, Beijing's actions from the outset – covering up the outbreak, blaming a wild animal market that it has since admitted wasn't at fault, barring outside investigators, burying data and silencing its own experts – have served to fuel suspicions.

Last week, leaked documents exposed how the Chinese government, under orders from President Xi Jinping, is strictly controlling all research into the origins of Covid while promoting fringe theories suggesting it came from outside China.

And it is an uncomfortable coincidence that Wuhan – a city buzzing once again, with busy shops, packed restaurants and many people without masks on the streets celebrating New Year – is home to the world's top coronavirus research unit as well as ground zero to a pandemic from a strange new strain.

The clues start with an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang, a hilly region in Yunnan, southern China, where bats roost in a network of underground caves, cracks and crannies.

Days after three Chinese miners who had been clearing bat droppings inside caves died, Zhengli went to investigate

Two weeks ago, a BBC reporter was prevented from reaching this remote site after being trailed by police for miles along bumpy tracks, then blocked by a lorry and confronted by men at roadblocks saying their job was to stop him.

The previous month, a team of US journalists had also been tailed by plainclothes police who barred their access.

One research team recently managed to take some samples at the mine, but reportedly had them confiscated.

The reason for such secrecy goes back to the end of April 2012 when a 42-year-old man clearing bat droppings in these underground caverns turned up at a nearby hospital with a bad cough, high fever and struggling to breathe.

Within a week, five colleagues had similar symptoms. Three later died, one after doctors spent more than 100 days fighting to save his life – yet the two youngest spent less than a week in the hospital and survived. Sound familiar?

We have since learned from a detailed masters thesis, which included medical reports and radiological scans, that these miners suffered a viral pneumonia, attributed to Sars-like coronaviruses originating from horseshoe bats.

One leading US health body pointed out last year that they had 'an illness remarkably similar to Covid-19'.

Little wonder a prominent vaccine scientist told me: 'This is about as close to a smoking gun as exists.'

Intriguingly, a second thesis three years later also highlighted these cases.

It was written by a student of Oxford-trained virologist Professor George Gao Fu, who is now head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which is leading their response to the pandemic.

So the Chinese authorities must have known about the dead miners.

Yet they quickly tried to blame the wildlife market in Wuhan as Covid's source, until challenged by respected studies revealed in this newspaper.

Following the miners' deaths, Shi Zhengli, a Wuhan-based virologist known as Batwoman for her expeditions to gather samples in such caves and a member of the team that traced the origin of Sars to bats, went to investigate.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats.

The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats. The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

Another expert noted how the miners who died were treated with anti-fungal medications, while those surviving were given other drugs.

'So in addition to the fact that the cases were more Sars-like than fungal-like, this treatment story argues against a fungal [cause],' he said.

'It is very odd that Shi Zhengli would assert these cases were fungal.'

Prof Shi examined samples in her Wuhan lab, a few miles from the infamous market. Studies later found the virus in sewage, but it was not detected in animals.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the first laboratory with the highest global bio-safety level in China.

It specialises in the study of bat-borne viruses and is spearheading China's drive to assert itself in bio-technology.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems.

The institute has carried out experiments on bat coronaviruses since 2015 – including research that can increase their virulence by combining snippets from different strains.

Some viruses were injected into special 'humanised' mice that had been created for use in labs with human genes, cells or tissues in their bodies.

These controversial experiments artificially force the evolution of viruses so as to boost our understanding of diseases and their transmissibility.

They help researchers develop new drugs and vaccines.

The Wuhan scientists were working with prominent Western experts and supported financially by the National Institutes of Health, the most important US funding body – although this relationship was ended on safety grounds after being revealed by The Mail on Sunday.

Some scientists argue this type of pathogen research is too risky since it could trigger a pandemic from a new disease.

As a result, there was a moratorium on such work by the US for four years under the Obama administration.

Other critics have warned that the Wuhan Institute was constructing 'chimeric' coronaviruses – new hybrid micro-organisms that show no sign of human manipulation.

Now the big question is whether they took samples from the coronavirus that killed the Yunnan miners and, back in their laboratory more than 1,000 miles away, created a new virus that somehow leaked out into their own city.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site

As leading experts have suggested, it would have been a logical step to create chimeric viruses by combining properties from different samples.

Many scientific breakthroughs have emerged from such speculative endeavours.

One medical professor suggested to me that the miners may have died after being exposed to very high doses of coronaviruses while working in deep shafts filled with bats and their droppings.

But the Wuhan scientists then struggled to prove causality in their lab as their samples were too weak to infect human cells.

'This would have stopped them publishing a major finding of a new Sars-like virus infecting humans.

The possibility is they might then have tried modifying the virus to make it better able to infect human cells in a bid to establish the missing link.'

This is, it must be stressed, unproven speculation.

And it is understandable why China wants to comprehend as much as possible about bat viruses that emerge in their country.

Yet as experts say, there are many unanswered questions centring on Beijing's reluctance to come clean about the miners' cases, viruses and samples held in their labs.

The Wuhan Institute has even taken key databases offline.

Key to all this is the enigmatic Batwoman, Prof Shi. First, she published a genetic sequence for Sars-Cov-2 – the strain of coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – which, despite close analysis of other novel features, ignored its most surprising characteristic.

This is 'the furin cleavage site', a mutation not found on similar types of coronavirus that allows its spike protein to bind so effectively to many human cells.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems

Then, last January, Prof Shi and two colleagues published a paper in Nature that revealed the existence of a virus called RaTG13 that was taken from a horseshoe bat and stored on their premises, the biggest repository of bat coronaviruses in Asia.

This paper, submitted on the same day China admitted to human transmission, caused a stir in the scientific world since it revealed the existence of the closest known relative to Sars-Cov-2 with more than 96 per cent genetic similarity.

It underlined that such diseases occur in nature – yet although closely related, it would have taken RaTG13 several decades to evolve in the wild into Sars-Cov-2 and was too distant to be manipulated in a laboratory.

Other experts wondered why there was so little information about this new strain. One reason soon became clear: the name had been changed from that of another virus called Ra4991 identified in a previous paper – but, unusually, not cited in the Nature piece.

This obscured a direct link to the dead miners, which was only confirmed when Nature sought publication of an 'addendum' following complaints.

The Wuhan team also admitted it had eight more Sars viruses from the Yunnan mine that have not been disclosed.

Some scientists say these new details raise many fresh issues – including a 20-point critique put on her blog by an Indian microbiologist called Monali Rahalkar.

Many high-profile experts, however, still dismiss the idea of a lab leak as a conspiracy theory.

Yet David Relman, one of the world's leading experts in this field, points out that scientists could easily have combined a 'furin cleavage site' from one viral ancestor with the backbone of Sars-Cov-2 taken from another.

'Alternatively, the complete Sars-Cov-2 sequence could have been recovered from a bat sample and viable virus recreated from a synthetic genome to study it before that virus accidentally escaped,' wrote Relman, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University's medical school, in a recent paper.

The former US government adviser on bio-security told me he raised the issues out of frustration with scientists who seemed discomforted by the idea.

'This perplexing story does not add up – the possibility of a lab accident cannot be discounted,' he said.

There have also been questions over the apparent disappearance of a young woman researcher who worked in the laboratory.

It has been suggested she might have been patient zero of this pandemic, although this has been denied by the Chinese authorities.

Even if the miners' link was eliminated, it would not rule out the possibility of an accident causing this pandemic.

Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said Wuhan scientists have shown in publications that they have sampled hundreds of bats and people living near bat caves in their search for Sars-related viruses.

'Even if the precursor to Sars-Cov-2 was not from these miners or the Mojiang mine, did they find other viruses that are very closely related that we do not yet know about?' she asked.

It sounds like the plot from a science-fiction film: an engineered virus leaking from a high-tech lab to cause global chaos.

Yet there are plenty of precedents, including two researchers infected with Sars in a Beijing virology lab in 2004.

Studies also show accidents with deadly pathogens are common in labs where people are working with microscopic viruses.

Prof Shi admitted she never expected an outbreak in a city so far from the home of the bats she studied.

She said her first thought on hearing coronaviruses might be the culprit was to wonder: 'Could they have come from our lab?'

She then frantically rushed back to Wuhan to check her records for any possible mishandling of materials – which proves she believed such a leak was a possibility.

There is also another lab in Wuhan with a lower level of bio-security, 500 yards from the animal market.

A study posted by two Chinese scientists in February on a site for sharing research – then pulled two days later – enigmatically claimed 605 bats were kept here, describing how some attacked, bled and urinated on a researcher.

'It is plausible that the virus leaked,' the paper concluded.

Perhaps this theory will unravel as we find out fresh facts.

Or scientists will uncover an alternative explanation for the path of Covid-19 from bats to humans.

Equally, it is possible we may never discover the truth about the origins of this virus.

But at this stage the only certainty is that we all do science – and indeed, investigative reporting – a disservice if this idea is discarded without being properly disproved and devoid of evidence.

The whistleblower described themselves as 'a patriot' who was 'motivated to expose a truth that had been censored, and honor colleagues who had also spoken out.' Alongside the true case and death tolls, the documents reveal for the first time that Hubei was in the midst of a major flu epidemic at the time coronavirus struck. By March 7, Hubei had officially logged 2,986 deaths from the virus, but leaked documents show that toll was actually 3,456 On March 7, Hubei province - where epicentre Wuhan was located - reported 83 new infections to the public. Leaked documents give a figure of 115 The province was reporting up to 20 times the normal number of seasonal flu cases in December 2019, centered in the cities of Yichang and Xianning. Wuhan, where coronavirus would first emerge, was third worst-affected. Data also shows that a large number of flu cases, including in Wuhan, were diagnosed as 'unknown cause' - dating a far back as December 2. Researchers told CNN that it is possible some of these were mis-diagnosed coronavirus cases, but there is no way to know for sure because the data is simply not available. Dr. Amesh Adalja, at Johns Hopkins University which has been at the forefront of tracking the virus, said: 'They were only testing for what they knew.' China claims it has done studies looking for cases of coronavirus in Wuhan before December 2019, but has been unable to find any. While there is no suggestion that the outbreaks are linked, the flu epidemic likely left health officials stretched and unprepared for the emergence of a new illness. The documents also reveal a shambles among China's early testing regime, which contributed to the cases being under-reported. According to the data, nucleic acid tests which were initially used to diagnose the virus only worked between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the time. Documents also reveal Hubei province was in the midst of a flu epidemic when coronavirus emerged, with hospitals under-funded and staff demoralised (file image) That meant scientists were often forced to use other methods - such as scans of the lungs - to diagnose patients they were sure had the virus, but whose tests kept coming back negative. But because of the way China's reporting system worked, only those cases which had been confirmed by the test were publicly reported. All other cases were marked down as 'suspected' or 'clinically diagnosed'. While bureaucrats would have been aware of both figures, and may have been aware of the problems with testing, they chose only to report cases with a positive test - at least initially. China did start adding 'clinically diagnosed' cases to its totals in mid-February, but by then the virus had already spread far beyond its own borders. Yanzhong Huang, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specilaises in Chinese public health, told CNN: 'It was clear they did make mistakes. 'Not just mistakes that happen when you're dealing with a novel virus, also bureaucratic and politically-motivated errors in how they handled it. 'These had global consequences.' The early testing regime also suffered huge delays, with the average time taken from the onset of disease to diagnosis being 23 days. That meant China's official daily totals were lagging three weeks behind reality, while at the same time hampering its own ability to respond to the crisis. Internal documents also show that Hubei health authorities were under-funded and suffering staff motivation issues when the pandemic struck. And while Beijing boasted that it had massively invested in early-stage detection of infectious diseases in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, in reality the system was slow, under-funded, and weighed down with bureaucracy.

The world must investigate all the mounting evidence Covid leaked from a Wuhan lab, writes IAN BIRRELL

By Ian Birrell for the Mail on Sunday

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Yet we still know little about how and why the virus spread with such devastating consequences.

It can almost certainly be traced to bats. But we do not know how this pathogen – having evolved an extraordinary ability to infect, causing such damage to different bodily organs – made the jump into human beings.

At last, a World Health Organisation investigation is under way into the origins of the coronavirus, but it is accused of meekly pandering to China's agenda by recruiting patsy scientists and relying on Beijing's dubious data.

Now there is growing clamour from experts around the world that no stone should be left unturned during this inquiry – and that it must include one key element of a hunt which has all the hallmarks of a thriller novel.

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan, writes Ian Birrell. Pictured: Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli, who was dubbed 'Batwoman', at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

Why did China build a virus lab in Wuhan? Chinese officials decided to build the Wuhan Institute of Virology after the country was ravaged by an outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003. SARS, another kind of coronavirus, killed 775 people and infected more than 8,000 globally in an epidemic that lasted about eight months. It took the Chinese 15 years to fully complete the project, which cost a total of 300million yuan (£34million). The French helped design the building. Its crown jewel is a four-storey lab with the highest biosafety level of P4. It's the most advanced laboratory of its type in China. Construction of the lab was finished in 2015 and it officially opened on January 5, 2018, after passing various safety inspections. Describing the significance of the P4 lab, China Youth Online billed it as the 'aircraft carrier of China's virology'. The state-run newspaper said it 'is capable of researching the deadliest pathogens'. One researcher, Zhou Peng, told state news agency Xinhua in 2018: 'We are proud to say that we are already at the forefront in the field of studying the immunity mechanism of bats, which carry viruses for a long time. 'Bats carry viruses but are not infected [by them]. [They] provide hope for mankind to study how to fight viruses.' Advertisement

This centres on a cave filled with bats, a clutch of mysterious deaths, some brilliant scientists carrying out futuristic experiments in a secretive laboratory – and a cover-up of epic proportions that, if proven, would have huge consequences for the Chinese Communist Party and the global practice of science.

So what, precisely, is this theory on the origins of this pandemic?

It must be stated clearly that it is just a theory, albeit one based on crumbs of evidence teased out by a few courageous scientists and some online detectives.

New diseases have emerged throughout human history. Most experts believe Covid to be a 'zoonotic' disease that spilled over naturally from animals to humans.

They think it was most likely 'amplified' by an intermediate species – similar to how Chinese people's consumption of civet cats sparked the 2002 Sars epidemic.

Yet at the same time, Beijing's actions from the outset – covering up the outbreak, blaming a wild animal market that it has since admitted wasn't at fault, barring outside investigators, burying data and silencing its own experts – have served to fuel suspicions.

Last week, leaked documents exposed how the Chinese government, under orders from President Xi Jinping, is strictly controlling all research into the origins of Covid while promoting fringe theories suggesting it came from outside China.

And it is an uncomfortable coincidence that Wuhan – a city buzzing once again, with busy shops, packed restaurants and many people without masks on the streets celebrating New Year – is home to the world's top coronavirus research unit as well as ground zero to a pandemic from a strange new strain.

The clues start with an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang, a hilly region in Yunnan, southern China, where bats roost in a network of underground caves, cracks and crannies.

Days after three Chinese miners who had been clearing bat droppings inside caves died, Zhengli went to investigate

Two weeks ago, a BBC reporter was prevented from reaching this remote site after being trailed by police for miles along bumpy tracks, then blocked by a lorry and confronted by men at roadblocks saying their job was to stop him.

The previous month, a team of US journalists had also been tailed by plainclothes police who barred their access.

One research team recently managed to take some samples at the mine, but reportedly had them confiscated.

The reason for such secrecy goes back to the end of April 2012 when a 42-year-old man clearing bat droppings in these underground caverns turned up at a nearby hospital with a bad cough, high fever and struggling to breathe.

Within a week, five colleagues had similar symptoms. Three later died, one after doctors spent more than 100 days fighting to save his life – yet the two youngest spent less than a week in the hospital and survived. Sound familiar?

We have since learned from a detailed masters thesis, which included medical reports and radiological scans, that these miners suffered a viral pneumonia, attributed to Sars-like coronaviruses originating from horseshoe bats.

One leading US health body pointed out last year that they had 'an illness remarkably similar to Covid-19'.

Little wonder a prominent vaccine scientist told me: 'This is about as close to a smoking gun as exists.'

Intriguingly, a second thesis three years later also highlighted these cases.

It was written by a student of Oxford-trained virologist Professor George Gao Fu, who is now head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which is leading their response to the pandemic.

So the Chinese authorities must have known about the dead miners.

Yet they quickly tried to blame the wildlife market in Wuhan as Covid's source, until challenged by respected studies revealed in this newspaper.

Following the miners' deaths, Shi Zhengli, a Wuhan-based virologist known as Batwoman for her expeditions to gather samples in such caves and a member of the team that traced the origin of Sars to bats, went to investigate.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats.

The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats. The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

Another expert noted how the miners who died were treated with anti-fungal medications, while those surviving were given other drugs.

'So in addition to the fact that the cases were more Sars-like than fungal-like, this treatment story argues against a fungal [cause],' he said.

'It is very odd that Shi Zhengli would assert these cases were fungal.'

Prof Shi examined samples in her Wuhan lab, a few miles from the infamous market. Studies later found the virus in sewage, but it was not detected in animals.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the first laboratory with the highest global bio-safety level in China.

It specialises in the study of bat-borne viruses and is spearheading China's drive to assert itself in bio-technology.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems.

The institute has carried out experiments on bat coronaviruses since 2015 – including research that can increase their virulence by combining snippets from different strains.

Some viruses were injected into special 'humanised' mice that had been created for use in labs with human genes, cells or tissues in their bodies.

These controversial experiments artificially force the evolution of viruses so as to boost our understanding of diseases and their transmissibility.

They help researchers develop new drugs and vaccines.

The Wuhan scientists were working with prominent Western experts and supported financially by the National Institutes of Health, the most important US funding body – although this relationship was ended on safety grounds after being revealed by The Mail on Sunday.

Some scientists argue this type of pathogen research is too risky since it could trigger a pandemic from a new disease.

As a result, there was a moratorium on such work by the US for four years under the Obama administration.

Other critics have warned that the Wuhan Institute was constructing 'chimeric' coronaviruses – new hybrid micro-organisms that show no sign of human manipulation.

Now the big question is whether they took samples from the coronavirus that killed the Yunnan miners and, back in their laboratory more than 1,000 miles away, created a new virus that somehow leaked out into their own city.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site

As leading experts have suggested, it would have been a logical step to create chimeric viruses by combining properties from different samples.

Many scientific breakthroughs have emerged from such speculative endeavours.

One medical professor suggested to me that the miners may have died after being exposed to very high doses of coronaviruses while working in deep shafts filled with bats and their droppings.

But the Wuhan scientists then struggled to prove causality in their lab as their samples were too weak to infect human cells.

'This would have stopped them publishing a major finding of a new Sars-like virus infecting humans.

The possibility is they might then have tried modifying the virus to make it better able to infect human cells in a bid to establish the missing link.'

This is, it must be stressed, unproven speculation.

And it is understandable why China wants to comprehend as much as possible about bat viruses that emerge in their country.

Yet as experts say, there are many unanswered questions centring on Beijing's reluctance to come clean about the miners' cases, viruses and samples held in their labs.

The Wuhan Institute has even taken key databases offline.

Key to all this is the enigmatic Batwoman, Prof Shi. First, she published a genetic sequence for Sars-Cov-2 – the strain of coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – which, despite close analysis of other novel features, ignored its most surprising characteristic.

This is 'the furin cleavage site', a mutation not found on similar types of coronavirus that allows its spike protein to bind so effectively to many human cells.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems

Then, last January, Prof Shi and two colleagues published a paper in Nature that revealed the existence of a virus called RaTG13 that was taken from a horseshoe bat and stored on their premises, the biggest repository of bat coronaviruses in Asia.

This paper, submitted on the same day China admitted to human transmission, caused a stir in the scientific world since it revealed the existence of the closest known relative to Sars-Cov-2 with more than 96 per cent genetic similarity.

It underlined that such diseases occur in nature – yet although closely related, it would have taken RaTG13 several decades to evolve in the wild into Sars-Cov-2 and was too distant to be manipulated in a laboratory.

Other experts wondered why there was so little information about this new strain. One reason soon became clear: the name had been changed from that of another virus called Ra4991 identified in a previous paper – but, unusually, not cited in the Nature piece.

This obscured a direct link to the dead miners, which was only confirmed when Nature sought publication of an 'addendum' following complaints.

The Wuhan team also admitted it had eight more Sars viruses from the Yunnan mine that have not been disclosed.

Some scientists say these new details raise many fresh issues – including a 20-point critique put on her blog by an Indian microbiologist called Monali Rahalkar.

Many high-profile experts, however, still dismiss the idea of a lab leak as a conspiracy theory.

Yet David Relman, one of the world's leading experts in this field, points out that scientists could easily have combined a 'furin cleavage site' from one viral ancestor with the backbone of Sars-Cov-2 taken from another.

'Alternatively, the complete Sars-Cov-2 sequence could have been recovered from a bat sample and viable virus recreated from a synthetic genome to study it before that virus accidentally escaped,' wrote Relman, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University's medical school, in a recent paper.

The former US government adviser on bio-security told me he raised the issues out of frustration with scientists who seemed discomforted by the idea.

'This perplexing story does not add up – the possibility of a lab accident cannot be discounted,' he said.

There have also been questions over the apparent disappearance of a young woman researcher who worked in the laboratory.

It has been suggested she might have been patient zero of this pandemic, although this has been denied by the Chinese authorities.

Even if the miners' link was eliminated, it would not rule out the possibility of an accident causing this pandemic.

Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said Wuhan scientists have shown in publications that they have sampled hundreds of bats and people living near bat caves in their search for Sars-related viruses.

'Even if the precursor to Sars-Cov-2 was not from these miners or the Mojiang mine, did they find other viruses that are very closely related that we do not yet know about?' she asked.

It sounds like the plot from a science-fiction film: an engineered virus leaking from a high-tech lab to cause global chaos.

Yet there are plenty of precedents, including two researchers infected with Sars in a Beijing virology lab in 2004.

Studies also show accidents with deadly pathogens are common in labs where people are working with microscopic viruses.

Prof Shi admitted she never expected an outbreak in a city so far from the home of the bats she studied.

She said her first thought on hearing coronaviruses might be the culprit was to wonder: 'Could they have come from our lab?'

She then frantically rushed back to Wuhan to check her records for any possible mishandling of materials – which proves she believed such a leak was a possibility.

There is also another lab in Wuhan with a lower level of bio-security, 500 yards from the animal market.

A study posted by two Chinese scientists in February on a site for sharing research – then pulled two days later – enigmatically claimed 605 bats were kept here, describing how some attacked, bled and urinated on a researcher.

'It is plausible that the virus leaked,' the paper concluded.

Perhaps this theory will unravel as we find out fresh facts.

Or scientists will uncover an alternative explanation for the path of Covid-19 from bats to humans.

Equally, it is possible we may never discover the truth about the origins of this virus.

But at this stage the only certainty is that we all do science – and indeed, investigative reporting – a disservice if this idea is discarded without being properly disproved and devoid of evidence.

2021-01-06 10:37:06+00:00,56,"China has denied entry to a team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts who were due to arrive in the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus.

The news comes amid growing suspicions of a cover-up in the country where Covid-19 is believed to have originated at the end of 2019, although its origins remain bitterly contested as China remains determined to control the narrative.

The head of the World Health Organisation says he was 'disappointed' that Chinese officials have not finalised permissions for the arrival of the team of experts.

A year after the outbreak started, WHO experts were due in China for a highly politicised visit to explore the origins of the coronavirus, in a trip trailed by accusations of cover-ups, conspiracy and fears of a whitewash.

The WHO said China granted permission for a visit by its experts, with a 10-person team expected to arrive this week - but before most could even begin their journeys they faced roadblocks, with Beijing yet to grant them entry.

The WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a 'logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.'

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.

'Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China,' he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.

'I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,' Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.

He added that he has 'been in contact with senior Chinese officials' and that he had 'once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.

'I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We're eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,' he said.

Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.

Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China's borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.

But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative.

An international expert team has set off for China to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Beijing has yet to provide the necessary access. Pictured: A TV grab taken on January 5, 2021 showing WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a press briefing on Covid-19, during which he criticised China for not allowing the team entry

The WHO team has promised to focus on the science, specifically how the coronavirus jumped from animals - believed to be bats - to humans.

'This is not about finding a guilty country or a guilty authority,' Fabian Leendertz from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's central disease control body who will be among the team to visit, told AFP new agency in late December.

'This is about understanding what happened to avoid that in the future, to reduce the risk.'

But doubt has been cast over what the WHO mission can reasonably expect to achieve and the state pressure they will face, raising fears that the mission will serve to rubber stamp China's official story, not challenge it.

The upcoming visit will not be the first time Covid-19 has brought WHO teams to China. A mission last year looked at the response by authorities rather than the virus origins, with another in the summer laying the groundwork for the upcoming probe.

But this time the WHO will wade into a swamp of competing interests, stuck between accusatory Western nations and a Chinese leadership determined to show that its secretive and hierarchical political system served to stem, not spread, the outbreak.

It is unclear who the experts will be able to meet when they arrive in Wuhan to retrace the initial days and weeks of the pandemic.

Inside China, whistleblowers have been silenced and citizen journalists jailed, including a 37-year-old woman imprisoned last week for four years over video reports from the city during its prolonged lockdown.

Outside, responsibility for the virus has been weaponized.

From the outset, US President Donald Trump used the virus as political bludgeon against big power rival China.

He accused Beijing of trying to hide the outbreak of what he dubbed the 'China virus' and repeated unsubstantiated rumours it leaked from a Wuhan lab.

Trump then pulled the US out of the WHO, accusing it of going soft on China, a nation with which he was also engaged in a bitter trade war.

Critics say that blizzard of accusations sought to divert attention from Washington's bungled response to a crisis which has so far killed more than 355,000 Americans.

Without them, said one, 'a lot of these situations that we had in January 2020 would not have played out the way it did.'

'It is the geopolitics that... put the world in this situation,' Ilona Kickbusch, of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, told AFP.

China has since deftly reframed its version of events, hailing its 'extraordinary success' in curbing the pandemic within its borders and rebooting its economy.

Beijing now says it will ride to the rescue of poorer nations, promising cheap vaccines and seeding doubt that the virus even originated in China.

Chinese doctors were recording at least DOUBLE the number of coronavirus cases that Beijing was reporting to the world in February, leaked documents revealed in December China under-reported its coronavirus cases and deaths by up to half during the early stages of the pandemic, leaked documents revealed in December. Beijing has long been accused of under-reporting its coronavirus numbers, but the data gives an idea of the scale of the problem for the first time. For example, on February 10 China reported 2,478 new cases of the virus across the entire country - but leaked data shows that, on the same date, Hubei province alone logged 5,918 cases. Meanwhile on March 7, Hubei was officially reporting a cumulative death toll of 2,986, but documents show it actually stood at 3,456. The official figures, which were reported across the world, downplayed the severity of the outbreak at a time when world leaders were trying to devise their own response strategies - leaving many unprepared for what was to come. China was able to use the figures and its authoritarian powers to lock down hard and early, all-but wiping the virus out and meaning its economy has grown this year, while under-prepared western democracies have seen their economies devastated. On February 10, China reported a total of 2,478 cases in its daily report, which was published around the world. Leaked documents show the total was 5,918 in Hubei province alone On February 17, the province of Hubei reported 93 new deaths to the public. In fact, documents show that it was 196 Other discrepancies revealed in the data include February 17, when Hubei officially reported 93 deaths from the virus while the documents show a toll of 196. On March 7, Hubei officially reported 83 cases, but 115 are recorded in the leaked papers. Another report also records the deaths of six health care workers from coronavirus by February 10, which were never publicly disclosed. Data also suggests that the number of cases recorded in 2019, when the virus first emerged, was 200. Until now, China has only publicly acknowledged 44 cases in 2019 - which it reported to the WHO as 'a pneumonia of unknown etiology' on January 3. The documents, comprising 117 pages, were handed to CNN by a whistleblower inside the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which was at the epicentre of the outbreak.

The clues start with an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang, a hilly region in Yunnan, southern China, where bats roost in a network of underground caves, cracks and crannies.

Days after three Chinese miners who had been clearing bat droppings inside caves died, Zhengli went to investigate

Two weeks ago, a BBC reporter was prevented from reaching this remote site after being trailed by police for miles along bumpy tracks, then blocked by a lorry and confronted by men at roadblocks saying their job was to stop him.

The previous month, a team of US journalists had also been tailed by plainclothes police who barred their access.

One research team recently managed to take some samples at the mine, but reportedly had them confiscated.

The reason for such secrecy goes back to the end of April 2012 when a 42-year-old man clearing bat droppings in these underground caverns turned up at a nearby hospital with a bad cough, high fever and struggling to breathe.

Within a week, five colleagues had similar symptoms. Three later died, one after doctors spent more than 100 days fighting to save his life – yet the two youngest spent less than a week in the hospital and survived. Sound familiar?

We have since learned from a detailed masters thesis, which included medical reports and radiological scans, that these miners suffered a viral pneumonia, attributed to Sars-like coronaviruses originating from horseshoe bats.

One leading US health body pointed out last year that they had 'an illness remarkably similar to Covid-19'.

Little wonder a prominent vaccine scientist told me: 'This is about as close to a smoking gun as exists.'

Intriguingly, a second thesis three years later also highlighted these cases.

It was written by a student of Oxford-trained virologist Professor George Gao Fu, who is now head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which is leading their response to the pandemic.

So the Chinese authorities must have known about the dead miners.

Yet they quickly tried to blame the wildlife market in Wuhan as Covid's source, until challenged by respected studies revealed in this newspaper.

Following the miners' deaths, Shi Zhengli, a Wuhan-based virologist known as Batwoman for her expeditions to gather samples in such caves and a member of the team that traced the origin of Sars to bats, went to investigate.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats.

The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

'The mine shaft stank like hell,' she told Scientific American magazine, explaining how her colleagues spent a year discovering new coronaviruses in samples taken from the blood and faeces of bats. The miners, she claimed, died from a fungal infection.

Another expert noted how the miners who died were treated with anti-fungal medications, while those surviving were given other drugs.

'So in addition to the fact that the cases were more Sars-like than fungal-like, this treatment story argues against a fungal [cause],' he said.

'It is very odd that Shi Zhengli would assert these cases were fungal.'

Prof Shi examined samples in her Wuhan lab, a few miles from the infamous market. Studies later found the virus in sewage, but it was not detected in animals.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the first laboratory with the highest global bio-safety level in China.

It specialises in the study of bat-borne viruses and is spearheading China's drive to assert itself in bio-technology.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems.

The institute has carried out experiments on bat coronaviruses since 2015 – including research that can increase their virulence by combining snippets from different strains.

Some viruses were injected into special 'humanised' mice that had been created for use in labs with human genes, cells or tissues in their bodies.

These controversial experiments artificially force the evolution of viruses so as to boost our understanding of diseases and their transmissibility.

They help researchers develop new drugs and vaccines.

The Wuhan scientists were working with prominent Western experts and supported financially by the National Institutes of Health, the most important US funding body – although this relationship was ended on safety grounds after being revealed by The Mail on Sunday.

Some scientists argue this type of pathogen research is too risky since it could trigger a pandemic from a new disease.

As a result, there was a moratorium on such work by the US for four years under the Obama administration.

Other critics have warned that the Wuhan Institute was constructing 'chimeric' coronaviruses – new hybrid micro-organisms that show no sign of human manipulation.

Now the big question is whether they took samples from the coronavirus that killed the Yunnan miners and, back in their laboratory more than 1,000 miles away, created a new virus that somehow leaked out into their own city.

Leaked diplomatic cables reveal that US officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site

As leading experts have suggested, it would have been a logical step to create chimeric viruses by combining properties from different samples.

Many scientific breakthroughs have emerged from such speculative endeavours.

One medical professor suggested to me that the miners may have died after being exposed to very high doses of coronaviruses while working in deep shafts filled with bats and their droppings.

But the Wuhan scientists then struggled to prove causality in their lab as their samples were too weak to infect human cells.

'This would have stopped them publishing a major finding of a new Sars-like virus infecting humans.

The possibility is they might then have tried modifying the virus to make it better able to infect human cells in a bid to establish the missing link.'

This is, it must be stressed, unproven speculation.

And it is understandable why China wants to comprehend as much as possible about bat viruses that emerge in their country.

Yet as experts say, there are many unanswered questions centring on Beijing's reluctance to come clean about the miners' cases, viruses and samples held in their labs.

The Wuhan Institute has even taken key databases offline.

Key to all this is the enigmatic Batwoman, Prof Shi. First, she published a genetic sequence for Sars-Cov-2 – the strain of coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – which, despite close analysis of other novel features, ignored its most surprising characteristic.

This is 'the furin cleavage site', a mutation not found on similar types of coronavirus that allows its spike protein to bind so effectively to many human cells.

The lab's own safety chief also publicly admitted concerns over flawed security systems

Then, last January, Prof Shi and two colleagues published a paper in Nature that revealed the existence of a virus called RaTG13 that was taken from a horseshoe bat and stored on their premises, the biggest repository of bat coronaviruses in Asia.

This paper, submitted on the same day China admitted to human transmission, caused a stir in the scientific world since it revealed the existence of the closest known relative to Sars-Cov-2 with more than 96 per cent genetic similarity.

It underlined that such diseases occur in nature – yet although closely related, it would have taken RaTG13 several decades to evolve in the wild into Sars-Cov-2 and was too distant to be manipulated in a laboratory.

Other experts wondered why there was so little information about this new strain. One reason soon became clear: the name had been changed from that of another virus called Ra4991 identified in a previous paper – but, unusually, not cited in the Nature piece.

This obscured a direct link to the dead miners, which was only confirmed when Nature sought publication of an 'addendum' following complaints.

The Wuhan team also admitted it had eight more Sars viruses from the Yunnan mine that have not been disclosed.

Some scientists say these new details raise many fresh issues – including a 20-point critique put on her blog by an Indian microbiologist called Monali Rahalkar.

Many high-profile experts, however, still dismiss the idea of a lab leak as a conspiracy theory.

Yet David Relman, one of the world's leading experts in this field, points out that scientists could easily have combined a 'furin cleavage site' from one viral ancestor with the backbone of Sars-Cov-2 taken from another.

'Alternatively, the complete Sars-Cov-2 sequence could have been recovered from a bat sample and viable virus recreated from a synthetic genome to study it before that virus accidentally escaped,' wrote Relman, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University's medical school, in a recent paper.

The former US government adviser on bio-security told me he raised the issues out of frustration with scientists who seemed discomforted by the idea.

'This perplexing story does not add up – the possibility of a lab accident cannot be discounted,' he said.

There have also been questions over the apparent disappearance of a young woman researcher who worked in the laboratory.

It has been suggested she might have been patient zero of this pandemic, although this has been denied by the Chinese authorities.

Even if the miners' link was eliminated, it would not rule out the possibility of an accident causing this pandemic.

Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said Wuhan scientists have shown in publications that they have sampled hundreds of bats and people living near bat caves in their search for Sars-related viruses.

'Even if the precursor to Sars-Cov-2 was not from these miners or the Mojiang mine, did they find other viruses that are very closely related that we do not yet know about?' she asked.

It sounds like the plot from a science-fiction film: an engineered virus leaking from a high-tech lab to cause global chaos.

Yet there are plenty of precedents, including two researchers infected with Sars in a Beijing virology lab in 2004.

Studies also show accidents with deadly pathogens are common in labs where people are working with microscopic viruses.

Prof Shi admitted she never expected an outbreak in a city so far from the home of the bats she studied.

She said her first thought on hearing coronaviruses might be the culprit was to wonder: 'Could they have come from our lab?'

She then frantically rushed back to Wuhan to check her records for any possible mishandling of materials – which proves she believed such a leak was a possibility.

There is also another lab in Wuhan with a lower level of bio-security, 500 yards from the animal market.

A study posted by two Chinese scientists in February on a site for sharing research – then pulled two days later – enigmatically claimed 605 bats were kept here, describing how some attacked, bled and urinated on a researcher.

'It is plausible that the virus leaked,' the paper concluded.

Perhaps this theory will unravel as we find out fresh facts.

Or scientists will uncover an alternative explanation for the path of Covid-19 from bats to humans.

Equally, it is possible we may never discover the truth about the origins of this virus.

But at this stage the only certainty is that we all do science – and indeed, investigative reporting – a disservice if this idea is discarded without being properly disproved and devoid of evidence.

2021-01-06 01:29:34+00:00,43,"China has denied entry to a team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts who were due to arrive in the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus.

The news comes amid growing suspicions of a cover-up in the country where Covid-19 is believed to have originated at the end of 2019, although its origins remain bitterly contested as China remains determined to control the narrative.

The head of the World Health Organisation says he was 'disappointed' that Chinese officials have not finalised permissions for the arrival of the team of experts.

A year after the outbreak started, WHO experts were due in China for a highly politicised visit to explore the origins of the coronavirus, in a trip trailed by accusations of cover-ups, conspiracy and fears of a whitewash.

The WHO said China granted permission for a visit by its experts, with a 10-person team expected to arrive this week - but before most could even begin their journeys they faced roadblocks, with Beijing yet to grant them entry.

Pictured: Workers in protective suits walk past the Hankou railway station in Wuhan in China's Hubei province, April 2020. Wuhan is believed to have been where the Covid-19 outbreak, that sparked the global pandemic, began. The first case was reported on December 31, 2019

The WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a 'logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.'

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.

'Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China,' he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.

'I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,' Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.

He added that he has 'been in contact with senior Chinese officials' and that he had 'once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.

'I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We're eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,' he said.

Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.

Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China's borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.

But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative.

An international expert team has set off for China to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Beijing has yet to provide the necessary access. Pictured: A TV grab taken on January 5, 2021 showing WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a press briefing on Covid-19, during which he criticised China for not allowing the team entry

The WHO team has promised to focus on the science, specifically how the coronavirus jumped from animals - believed to be bats - to humans.

'This is not about finding a guilty country or a guilty authority,' Fabian Leendertz from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's central disease control body who will be among the team to visit, told AFP new agency in late December.

'This is about understanding what happened to avoid that in the future, to reduce the risk.'

But doubt has been cast over what the WHO mission can reasonably expect to achieve and the state pressure they will face, raising fears that the mission will serve to rubber stamp China's official story, not challenge it.

The upcoming visit will not be the first time Covid-19 has brought WHO teams to China. A mission last year looked at the response by authorities rather than the virus origins, with another in the summer laying the groundwork for the upcoming probe.

But this time the WHO will wade into a swamp of competing interests, stuck between accusatory Western nations and a Chinese leadership determined to show that its secretive and hierarchical political system served to stem, not spread, the outbreak.

It is unclear who the experts will be able to meet when they arrive in Wuhan to retrace the initial days and weeks of the pandemic.

Inside China, whistleblowers have been silenced and citizen journalists jailed, including a 37-year-old woman imprisoned last week for four years over video reports from the city during its prolonged lockdown.

Outside, responsibility for the virus has been weaponized.

From the outset, US President Donald Trump used the virus as political bludgeon against big power rival China.

He accused Beijing of trying to hide the outbreak of what he dubbed the 'China virus' and repeated unsubstantiated rumours it leaked from a Wuhan lab.

Trump then pulled the US out of the WHO, accusing it of going soft on China, a nation with which he was also engaged in a bitter trade war.

Critics say that blizzard of accusations sought to divert attention from Washington's bungled response to a crisis which has so far killed more than 355,000 Americans.

Without them, said one, 'a lot of these situations that we had in January 2020 would not have played out the way it did.'

'It is the geopolitics that... put the world in this situation,' Ilona Kickbusch, of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, told AFP.

China has since deftly reframed its version of events, hailing its 'extraordinary success' in curbing the pandemic within its borders and rebooting its economy.

Beijing now says it will ride to the rescue of poorer nations, promising cheap vaccines and seeding doubt that the virus even originated in China.

Chinese doctors were recording at least DOUBLE the number of coronavirus cases that Beijing was reporting to the world in February, leaked documents revealed in December China under-reported its coronavirus cases and deaths by up to half during the early stages of the pandemic, leaked documents revealed in December. Beijing has long been accused of under-reporting its coronavirus numbers, but the data gives an idea of the scale of the problem for the first time. For example, on February 10 China reported 2,478 new cases of the virus across the entire country - but leaked data shows that, on the same date, Hubei province alone logged 5,918 cases. Meanwhile on March 7, Hubei was officially reporting a cumulative death toll of 2,986, but documents show it actually stood at 3,456. The official figures, which were reported across the world, downplayed the severity of the outbreak at a time when world leaders were trying to devise their own response strategies - leaving many unprepared for what was to come. China was able to use the figures and its authoritarian powers to lock down hard and early, all-but wiping the virus out and meaning its economy has grown this year, while under-prepared western democracies have seen their economies devastated. On February 10, China reported a total of 2,478 cases in its daily report, which was published around the world. Leaked documents show the total was 5,918 in Hubei province alone On February 17, the province of Hubei reported 93 new deaths to the public. In fact, documents show that it was 196 Other discrepancies revealed in the data include February 17, when Hubei officially reported 93 deaths from the virus while the documents show a toll of 196. On March 7, Hubei officially reported 83 cases, but 115 are recorded in the leaked papers. Another report also records the deaths of six health care workers from coronavirus by February 10, which were never publicly disclosed. Data also suggests that the number of cases recorded in 2019, when the virus first emerged, was 200. Until now, China has only publicly acknowledged 44 cases in 2019 - which it reported to the WHO as 'a pneumonia of unknown etiology' on January 3. The documents, comprising 117 pages, were handed to CNN by a whistleblower inside the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which was at the epicentre of the outbreak. The whistleblower described themselves as 'a patriot' who was 'motivated to expose a truth that had been censored, and honor colleagues who had also spoken out.' Alongside the true case and death tolls, the documents reveal for the first time that Hubei was in the midst of a major flu epidemic at the time coronavirus struck. By March 7, Hubei had officially logged 2,986 deaths from the virus, but leaked documents show that toll was actually 3,456 On March 7, Hubei province - where epicentre Wuhan was located - reported 83 new infections to the public. Leaked documents give a figure of 115 The province was reporting up to 20 times the normal number of seasonal flu cases in December 2019, centered in the cities of Yichang and Xianning. Wuhan, where coronavirus would first emerge, was third worst-affected. Data also shows that a large number of flu cases, including in Wuhan, were diagnosed as 'unknown cause' - dating a far back as December 2. Researchers told CNN that it is possible some of these were mis-diagnosed coronavirus cases, but there is no way to know for sure because the data is simply not available. Dr. Amesh Adalja, at Johns Hopkins University which has been at the forefront of tracking the virus, said: 'They were only testing for what they knew.' China claims it has done studies looking for cases of coronavirus in Wuhan before December 2019, but has been unable to find any. While there is no suggestion that the outbreaks are linked, the flu epidemic likely left health officials stretched and unprepared for the emergence of a new illness. The documents also reveal a shambles among China's early testing regime, which contributed to the cases being under-reported. According to the data, nucleic acid tests which were initially used to diagnose the virus only worked between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the time. Documents also reveal Hubei province was in the midst of a flu epidemic when coronavirus emerged, with hospitals under-funded and staff demoralised (file image) That meant scientists were often forced to use other methods - such as scans of the lungs - to diagnose patients they were sure had the virus, but whose tests kept coming back negative. But because of the way China's reporting system worked, only those cases which had been confirmed by the test were publicly reported. All other cases were marked down as 'suspected' or 'clinically diagnosed'. While bureaucrats would have been aware of both figures, and may have been aware of the problems with testing, they chose only to report cases with a positive test - at least initially. China did start adding 'clinically diagnosed' cases to its totals in mid-February, but by then the virus had already spread far beyond its own borders. Yanzhong Huang, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specilaises in Chinese public health, told CNN: 'It was clear they did make mistakes. 'Not just mistakes that happen when you're dealing with a novel virus, also bureaucratic and politically-motivated errors in how they handled it. 'These had global consequences.' The early testing regime also suffered huge delays, with the average time taken from the onset of disease to diagnosis being 23 days. That meant China's official daily totals were lagging three weeks behind reality, while at the same time hampering its own ability to respond to the crisis. Internal documents also show that Hubei health authorities were under-funded and suffering staff motivation issues when the pandemic struck. And while Beijing boasted that it had massively invested in early-stage detection of infectious diseases in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, in reality the system was slow, under-funded, and weighed down with bureaucracy.

The world must investigate all the mounting evidence Covid leaked from a Wuhan lab, writes IAN BIRRELL

By Ian Birrell for the Mail on Sunday

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Yet we still know little about how and why the virus spread with such devastating consequences.

It can almost certainly be traced to bats. But we do not know how this pathogen – having evolved an extraordinary ability to infect, causing such damage to different bodily organs – made the jump into human beings.

At last, a World Health Organisation investigation is under way into the origins of the coronavirus, but it is accused of meekly pandering to China's agenda by recruiting patsy scientists and relying on Beijing's dubious data.

Now there is growing clamour from experts around the world that no stone should be left unturned during this inquiry – and that it must include one key element of a hunt which has all the hallmarks of a thriller novel.

It is a year since the world learned of a deadly new respiratory disease stalking the central Chinese city of Wuhan, writes Ian Birrell. Pictured: Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli, who was dubbed 'Batwoman', at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

Why did China build a virus lab in Wuhan? Chinese officials decided to build the Wuhan Institute of Virology after the country was ravaged by an outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003. SARS, another kind of coronavirus, killed 775 people and infected more than 8,000 globally in an epidemic that lasted about eight months. It took the Chinese 15 years to fully complete the project, which cost a total of 300million yuan (£34million). The French helped design the building. Its crown jewel is a four-storey lab with the highest biosafety level of P4. It's the most advanced laboratory of its type in China. Construction of the lab was finished in 2015 and it officially opened on January 5, 2018, after passing various safety inspections. Describing the significance of the P4 lab, China Youth Online billed it as the 'aircraft carrier of China's virology'. The state-run newspaper said it 'is capable of researching the deadliest pathogens'. One researcher, Zhou Peng, told state news agency Xinhua in 2018: 'We are proud to say that we are already at the forefront in the field of studying the immunity mechanism of bats, which carry viruses for a long time. 'Bats carry viruses but are not infected [by them]. [They] provide hope for mankind to study how to fight viruses.' Advertisement

This centres on a cave filled with bats, a clutch of mysterious deaths, some brilliant scientists carrying out futuristic experiments in a secretive laboratory – and a cover-up of epic proportions that, if proven, would have huge consequences for the Chinese Communist Party and the global practice of science.

So what, precisely, is this theory on the origins of this pandemic?

It must be stated clearly that it is just a theory, albeit one based on crumbs of evidence teased out by a few courageous scientists and some online detectives.

New diseases have emerged throughout human history. Most experts believe Covid to be a 'zoonotic' disease that spilled over naturally from animals to humans.

They think it was most likely 'amplified' by an intermediate species – similar to how Chinese people's consumption of civet cats sparked the 2002 Sars epidemic.

Yet at the same time, Beijing's actions from the outset – covering up the outbreak, blaming a wild animal market that it has since admitted wasn't at fault, barring outside investigators, burying data and silencing its own experts – have served to fuel suspicions.

Last week, leaked documents exposed how the Chinese government, under orders from President Xi Jinping, is strictly controlling all research into the origins of Covid while promoting fringe theories suggesting it came from outside China.

And it is an uncomfortable coincidence that Wuhan – a city buzzing once again, with busy shops, packed restaurants and many people without masks on the streets celebrating New Year – is home to the world's top coronavirus research unit as well as ground zero to a pandemic from a strange new strain.

The clues start with an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang, a hilly region in Yunnan, southern China, where bats roost in a network of underground caves, cracks and crannies.

Days after three Chinese miners who had been clearing bat droppings inside caves died, Zhengli went to investigate

Two weeks ago, a BBC reporter was prevented from reaching this remote site after being trailed by police for miles along bumpy tracks, then blocked by a lorry and confronted by men at roadblocks saying their job was to stop him.

The previous month, a team of US journalists had also been tailed by plainclothes police who barred their access.

One research team recently managed to take some samples at the mine, but reportedly had them confiscated.

The reason for such secrecy goes back to the end of April 2012 when a 42-year-old man clearing bat droppings in these underground caverns turned up at a nearby hospital with a bad cough, high fever and struggling to breathe.

Some scientists say these new details raise many fresh issues – including a 20-point critique put on her blog by an Indian microbiologist called Monali Rahalkar.

Many high-profile experts, however, still dismiss the idea of a lab leak as a conspiracy theory.

Yet David Relman, one of the world's leading experts in this field, points out that scientists could easily have combined a 'furin cleavage site' from one viral ancestor with the backbone of Sars-Cov-2 taken from another.

'Alternatively, the complete Sars-Cov-2 sequence could have been recovered from a bat sample and viable virus recreated from a synthetic genome to study it before that virus accidentally escaped,' wrote Relman, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University's medical school, in a recent paper.

The former US government adviser on bio-security told me he raised the issues out of frustration with scientists who seemed discomforted by the idea.

'This perplexing story does not add up – the possibility of a lab accident cannot be discounted,' he said.

There have also been questions over the apparent disappearance of a young woman researcher who worked in the laboratory.

It has been suggested she might have been patient zero of this pandemic, although this has been denied by the Chinese authorities.

Even if the miners' link was eliminated, it would not rule out the possibility of an accident causing this pandemic.

Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said Wuhan scientists have shown in publications that they have sampled hundreds of bats and people living near bat caves in their search for Sars-related viruses.

'Even if the precursor to Sars-Cov-2 was not from these miners or the Mojiang mine, did they find other viruses that are very closely related that we do not yet know about?' she asked.

It sounds like the plot from a science-fiction film: an engineered virus leaking from a high-tech lab to cause global chaos.

Yet there are plenty of precedents, including two researchers infected with Sars in a Beijing virology lab in 2004.

Studies also show accidents with deadly pathogens are common in labs where people are working with microscopic viruses.

Prof Shi admitted she never expected an outbreak in a city so far from the home of the bats she studied.

She said her first thought on hearing coronaviruses might be the culprit was to wonder: 'Could they have come from our lab?'

She then frantically rushed back to Wuhan to check her records for any possible mishandling of materials – which proves she believed such a leak was a possibility.

There is also another lab in Wuhan with a lower level of bio-security, 500 yards from the animal market.

A study posted by two Chinese scientists in February on a site for sharing research – then pulled two days later – enigmatically claimed 605 bats were kept here, describing how some attacked, bled and urinated on a researcher.

'It is plausible that the virus leaked,' the paper concluded.

Perhaps this theory will unravel as we find out fresh facts.

Or scientists will uncover an alternative explanation for the path of Covid-19 from bats to humans.

Equally, it is possible we may never discover the truth about the origins of this virus.

But at this stage the only certainty is that we all do science – and indeed, investigative reporting – a disservice if this idea is discarded without being properly disproved and devoid of evidence.

Hu Xijin, the head of state-run propaganda publication The Global Times, praised Beijing's decision to inoculate its working population ahead of the others as 'responsible'.

While the United Kingdom and other Western countries prioritise the immunisation of senior citizens and essential workers to reach herd immunity, China is racing to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 59 who work for the government and public services or have plans to travel overseas.

Hu Xijin (pictured), the head of state-run propaganda outlet The Global Times, has praised Beijing's decision to inoculate its working population ahead of the others as 'responsible'

Hu's harsh commentary came after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager in Britain yesterday became the first person in the world to receive the Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine outside clinical trials.

It also came after PM Boris Johnson announced a new national lockdown from last night to tackle a surge in COVID-19 infections driven by a new, more transmissible variant of the virus.

Hu lashed out at the United States for promoting the Pfizer vaccine, the world's first authorised COVID-19 jab which was approved by the UK authorities in early December.

He condemned the Trump Administration for 'touting' the product 'on insufficient evidence', but did not provide further explanations.

He then hailed China's homegrown COVID-19 vaccine, which is produced by state-run drug maker Sinopharm and said to have an efficacy rate of 79 per cent.

On New Year's Eve, Chinese health authorities granted 'conditional' approval to Sinopharm's vaccine. The country is now aiming to vaccinate millions of people before the upcoming Lunar New Year travel rush in mid-February.

China is putting nine 'key groups' of people ahead of the queue in its immunisation campaign.

They include customs inspection and quarantine officers for imported frozen food, international and domestic transport workers, and employees of government organisations, police, fire brigades and local communities.

Staff in the logistics and public utility sectors are also included. So are those who plan to study or work overseas.

In Hu Says, an online talk show published by the Global Times, the outspoken, 60-year-old editor insisted that avoiding the elderly in COVID-19 vaccination reflected China's 'responsible attitude'.

'Western public opinion believes that the COVID-19 vaccine should be first distributed among the elderly and that avoiding this group indicates that Sinopharm's vaccine is not yet mature. I think it reflects China's responsible attitude,' Hu argued in English.

Hu asserted that 'very few' new infections in China were elderly people, and that middle-aged and younger people who were socially active could spread the disease more quickly.

'That's why the Chinese government's decision fits our situation on the ground,' he concluded in the show.

While many countries are pinning their hope of beating coronavirus on the roll-out of vaccines, Hu's Global Times compared the effect of the injections to 'water hoses against a wildfire' in the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a separate opinion piece, the Communist mouthpiece escalated its criticism against the West by calling on democratic countries to stop betting on vaccines and start learning from China and adopting a centralised social system.

'A vaccine is a powerful weapon against the pandemic. But as the virus has spread extensively, the effect of vaccines is similar to water hoses against a wildfire,' read the article which mainly ripped into the United States.

'Other measures must be taken simultaneously to stop it from spreading, and finally being eradicated.'

The strongly-worded piece added: 'The final outcome of the world's COVID-19 fight may depend on whether the US and the West can carry out important reforms to make up for their shortcomings in social organisation and mobilisation.'

China -- where the coronavirus first emerged late in 2019 -- has broadly stamped out the virus inside its borders, introducing swift local lockdowns and mass testing when cases emerge.

But the country has stepped up testing and movement controls after a recent spate of small local outbreaks, including a handful of cases in Beijing.

2021-01-06 00:33:04+00:00,6,"Scammers are offering fake COVID-19 vaccines online, in e-mails and on messaging apps, luring victims by claiming they can deliver shots within days for as little as $150 up to $1,000.

US government and European officials say coronavirus vaccine scams are on the rise and are warning the public against fraudsters who swindle customers out of money and personal data.

Some of these scams have emerged on dark web forums such as Agartha and on messaging app Telegram, where seven different offers for alleged vaccines were found.

These schemes also appeared in e-mails promising entry to supposed secret lists for early vaccine access and robocallers impersonating government agencies.

Now the US, FBI and Interpol are warning of pandemic-related fraud schemes, exploiting concerns over the slower-than-promised rollout of the vaccines. Most Americans will have to wait well into the spring and summer to get their shot.

Just 4.66 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the US in the last three weeks despite federal officials having distributed 15.4 million doses to the states. That is a fraction of the 20 million who were supposed to have been vaccinated by the end of 2020, according to earlier government forecasts

Just 4.66 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the US in the last three weeks despite federal officials having distributed 15.4 million doses to the states.

It means more than two-thirds of the vaccines shipped within the US have gone unused and just 1.4 percent of the population has been vaccinated as cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to surge across the US.

That is a fraction of the 20 million who were supposed to have been vaccinated by the end of 2020, according to earlier government forecasts.

One in 930 Americans have now died from COVID-19 with the death toll surging past 353,000 and the seven-day rolling average for fatalities at just over 2,600 per day.

On the dark web, COVID-19 vaccines are being advertised next to traditional illicit goods for sale.

On dark web forum Agartha, fake COVID-19 vaccines were offered next to cocaine, opioid medication, 'super high quality fake money,' hand guns and gift cards.

Posts showed stock photos of vaccines and offered vials for $500 and $1,000, or the equivalent in Bitcoin.

On another dark web site, a seller claiming to be from the 'Wuhan Institute of Science' offered COVID-19 vaccines in exchange for a donation, and asked buyers to provide their medical history.

On Telegram, several channels claimed to offer COVID-19 vaccines, accompanied by stock images.

One user offered supposed Moderna Inc vaccines for $180, and claimed the vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE could be had for $150 and AstraZeneca’s for $110 per vial.

Asked how the vaccines would be shipped, the account creator said they were transported in 'regulated temperature packs' and ice packs within a few days, or overnight for an additional charge.

The United States has so far authorized two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use - the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna

Dr. Melisha Cumberland is given the the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine twenty-one days after receiving the first shot from RN Valerie Massaro of Hartford HealthCare, at the Hartford Convention Center in Hartford, Connecticut on January 4

Website domains containing the word vaccine in combination with COVID-19 or coronavirus more than doubled since October to roughly 2,500 in November, when the first legitimate vaccines were nearing regulatory approval, according to cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, which is tracking COVID-19 fraud online.

'So far a lot of these domains just appear to be opportunistic registrations, but some are going to be used for phishing attempts to have people click on (malicious) links,' said Lindsay Kaye, director of operational outcomes at Recorded Future.

She said her team, which also scours the dark web, has not come across any legitimate vaccine that was diverted from healthcare facilities or national stockpiles.

The real COVID-19 vaccines, particularly the Pfizer/BioNTech offering, must be temperature controlled to remain effective.

Drugmakers have equipped shipments with temperature trackers to ensure they remain cold and distribution is tightly controlled by officials and will be administered at no cost.

The United States has so far authorized two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use - the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The European Union to date has authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and is expected to clear the Moderna vaccine this week.

The UK has already authorized those two and just added the vaccine developed by Oxford University with AstraZeneca.

Asked about vaccine scams, Pfizer said it had taken meticulous steps to reduce the risk of counterfeiting and tracked trends very carefully.

'Patients should never try to secure a vaccine online - no legitimate vaccine is sold online - and only get vaccinated at certified vaccination centers or by certified healthcare providers,' a Pfizer spokesman said in a statement.

Moderna referred a request for comment to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which did not respond. AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment.

According to a state-by-state breakdown, Kansas and Georgia have only administered 17 percent of the doses distributed to them. Hard-hit California has so far used 24 percent of its vaccine shots, while Florida has used 23 percent

Those who encounter COVID-19 vaccines are urged to report them, including people asking for out-of-pocket payments or online vaccine ads.

Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Tuesday admitted that the largest vaccination campaign in US history, which has been in the works for months amid the pandemic, has been a 'little bit messy'.

He blamed, in part, the states for the slower than expected rollout despite the federal government falling short of its initial promise to have 20 million vaccinated by the end of 2020.

The race to vaccinate American quickly comes as a super-contagious mutant strain of COVID-19 that has forced the UK into its third lockdown has already been detected in the US. Ten people, who are spread across New York, California, Colorado and Florida, have been confirmed to have the variant of the virus.

So far California has only vaccinated 1 percent of its 40 million population and the Governors of New York and Florida have vowed to penalize hospitals that fail to dispense shots quickly.",MailOnline,"['scammers', 'dark', 'supposed', 'web', 'fake', 'rollout', 'million', 'sell', 'pfizerbiontech', 'vaccine', 'far', 'slow', 'covid19', 'vaccinated', 'vaccines', 'amid']",0

On New Year's Eve, Chinese health authorities granted 'conditional' approval to a vaccine candidate made by Chinese pharma giant Sinopharm, which the company said had a 79 per cent efficacy rate.

According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, citizens of Beijing who belong to one of the nine 'key groups' and are aged between 18 and 59 will be arranged to receive their vaccine before the Lunar New Year, which falls on February 12 this year.

They include customs inspection and quarantine officers for imported frozen food, international and domestic transport workers, as well as employees of government organisations, police, fire brigades and local communities.

Staff in the logistics and public utility sectors are also included. So are those who plan to study or work overseas.

Gao Xiaojun, spokesperson of Beijing Municipal Health Commission, said on Sunday that all of those in the 'key groups' would get their first jab by mid-January and could expect to receive the second dose two to four weeks after.

More than 73,500 people in the Chinese capital received their first dose of the vaccine on January 1 and 2, Xinhua reported.

Health officials said gyms and empty factories were among centres being used for the vaccination programme. People submit forms to receive their COVID-19 vaccine at a makeshift vaccination site in Beijing's Chaoyang district on January 3

An AFP journalist saw people being bussed into a temporary vaccine centre at a central park, after being instructed to fill in electronic forms about their health status and any allergies at an outside gate.

Some were wearing two layers of surgical face masks.

One man surnamed Gu, a catering worker in his 30s, told AFP his employer had booked him a vaccine appointment at the centre, and that he wanted the jab 'for peace of mind.'

'I believe any adverse effects will be controllable,' he said.

Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed queues outside local hospitals and community health centres as people waited to read consent forms and have their temperatures taken before getting the jab.

Health officials said gyms and empty factories were among centres being used for the vaccination programme.

The official outlet also showed Dr Zhang Wenhong, who leads Shanghai's fight against the coronavirus, receiving his vaccine at his workplace, Huashan Hospital.

China has linked several of its recent Covid-19 outbreaks to traces of virus found on the packaging of imported frozen food. This photo taken on December 29, 2020, shows a medical worker vaccinating a man in Hefei in eastern China's Anhui

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in northern China was among the first Chinese regions to roll out its mass vaccination campaign.

Each of the local vaccination centres was inoculating 400 and 500 people every day, CCTV reported on Monday.

An estimated 500,000 locals are due to get their first injection by January 5, and the second by February 5, the report said.

In eastern China's Shandong Province, people working for the frozen food industry were given priority access to the vaccine in the county of Tancheng.

Xia Dongdong, a worker dealing with frozen food, told a reporter: 'In the past, we were scared to be in this industry. But now, [we] are lucky to be the first batch to be given the vaccine. Now I feel really excited and reassured.'

China has linked several of its recent Covid-19 outbreaks to traces of virus found on the packaging of imported frozen food.

Authorities have ramped up disinfection and virus testing on frozen food and are now vaccinating frozen food chain workers. One leading expert even suggested that the virus could survive for 20 years in minus 20 degrees Celsius.

China's testing of packaging has stirred some controversy, with exporters of frozen food items questioning the science behind it and whether it amounts to an unfair trade barrier.

The World Health Organization has said people should not fear food or food packaging during the pandemic. Chinese officials say there is still a risk of transmission.

It was also confirmed that the monarch would receive the second dose in around three weeks as is usual with the batch.

Margrethe II is the first European sovereign to officially announce the news of her vaccination.

Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace refuses to say if Her Majesty or Prince Philip have been given the Covid vaccine, insisting that it's a 'private' matter.

2021-01-02 07:42:05+00:00,36,"Deep in the lush mountain valleys of southern China lies the entrance to a mine shaft that once harboured bats with the closest known relative of the Covid-19 virus.

The area is of intense scientific interest because it may hold clues to the origins of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1.7million people worldwide. Yet for scientists and journalists, it has become a black hole of no information because of political sensitivity and secrecy.

A bat research team visiting recently managed to take samples but had them confiscated, two people familiar with the matter said. Specialists in coronaviruses have been ordered not to speak to the press. And a team of Associated Press journalists was tailed by plainclothes police in multiple cars who blocked access to roads and sites in late November.

More than a year since the first known person was infected with the coronavirus, an AP investigation shows the Chinese government is strictly controlling all research into its origins, clamping down on some while actively promoting fringe theories that it could have come from outside China.

The government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and affiliated with the military, the AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping, according to internal documents obtained by The AP.

A rare leak from within the government, the dozens of pages of unpublished documents confirm what many have long suspected: The clampdown comes from the top.

As a result, very little has been made public. Authorities are severely limiting information and impeding cooperation with international scientists.

'What did they find?' asked Gregory Gray, a Duke University epidemiologist who oversees a lab in China studying the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to people. 'Maybe their data were not conclusive, or maybe they suppressed the data for some political reason. I don't know...I wish I did.'

Unprecedented restrictions on research mean that many studies done into Covid-19 in China are yet to be published. Pictured: A man shines a light in the abandoned Wanling cave near Manhaguo village in southern China's Yunnan province on Wednesday, December 2, 2020. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred altar presided over by a Buddhist monk - precisely the kind of contact between bats and people that alarms scientists

The AP investigation was based on dozens of interviews with Chinese and foreign scientists and officials, along with public notices, leaked emails, internal data and the documents from China's cabinet and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It reveals a pattern of government secrecy and top-down control that has been evident throughout the pandemic.

As the AP previously documented, this culture has delayed warnings about the pandemic, blocked the sharing of information with the World Health Organization and hampered early testing. Scientists familiar with China's public health system say the same practices apply to sensitive research.

'They only select people they can trust, those that they can control,' said a public health expert who works regularly with the China CDC, declining to be identified out of fear of retribution. 'Military teams and others are working hard on this, but whether it gets published all depends on the outcome.'

The pandemic has crippled Beijing's reputation on the global stage, and China's leaders are wary of any findings that could suggest they were negligent in its spread. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Health Commission, which are managing research into the coronavirus' origins, did not respond to requests for comment.

'The novel coronavirus has been discovered in many parts of the world,' China's foreign ministry said in a fax. 'Scientists should carry out international scientific research and cooperation on a global scale.'

Some Chinese scientists say little has been shared simply because nothing of significance has been discovered.

'We've been looking, but we haven't found it,' said Zhang Yongzhen, a renowned Chinese virologist.

China's leaders are far from alone in politicising research into the origins of the virus. In April, President Donald Trump shelved a U.S.-funded project to identify dangerous animal diseases in China and Southeast Asia, effectively severing ties between Chinese and American scientists and complicating the search for virus origins.

Trump also has accused China of setting off the pandemic through an accident at a Wuhan lab - a theory that some experts say cannot be ruled out but as yet has no evidence behind it.

Research into Covid-19's origins is critical to the prevention of future pandemics. Although a World Health Organization international team plans to visit China in early January to investigate what started the pandemic, its members and agenda had to be approved by China.

Some public health experts warn that China's refusal to grant further access to international scientists has jeopardised the global collaboration that pinpointed the source of the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago. Jonna Mazet, a founding executive director of the UC Davis One Health Institute, said the lack of collaboration between Chinese and U.S. scientists was 'a disappointment' and the inability of American scientists to work in China 'devastating.'

'There's so much speculation around the origins of this virus,' Mazet said. 'We need to step back...and let scientists get the real answer without the finger-pointing.'

The hidden hunt for the origins of Covid-19 shows how the Chinese government has tried to steer the narrative.

The search started in the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan, a sprawling, low-slung complex where many of the first human coronavirus cases were detected. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market, such as civet cats implicated in the spread of SARS.

In mid-December last year, Huanan vendor Jiang Dafa started noticing people were falling ill. Among the first was a part-time worker in his 60s who helped clean carcasses at a stall; soon, a friend he played chess with also fell ill. A third, a seafood monger in his 40s, was infected and later died.

Patients began trickling into nearby hospitals, triggering alarms by late December that alerted the China CDC. CDC chief Gao Fu immediately sent a team to investigate.

At first, research appeared to be moving swiftly.

Overnight on January 1, the market suddenly was ordered shut, barring vendors from fetching their belongings, Jiang said. China CDC researchers collected 585 environmental samples from door handles, sewage and the floor of the market, and authorities sprayed the complex down with sanitiser. Later, they would cart out everything inside and incinerate it.

Internal China CDC data obtained by the AP shows that by January 10 and 11, researchers were sequencing dozens of environmental samples from Wuhan. Gary Kobinger, a Canadian microbiologist advising WHO, emailed his colleagues to share his concerns that the virus originated at the market.

'This corona(virus) is very close to SARS,' he wrote on January 13. 'If we put aside an accident...then I would look at the bats in these markets (sold and 'wild').'

By late January, Chinese state media announced that 33 of the environmental samples had tested positive. In a report to WHO, officials said 11 specimens were more than 99% similar to the new coronavirus. They also told the U.N. health agency that rats and mice were common in the market, and that most of the positive samples were clustered in an area where vendors traded in wildlife.

In the meantime, Jiang avoided telling people he worked at Huanan because of the stigma. He criticised the political tussle between China and the U.S.

'It's pointless to blame anyone for this disease,' Jiang said.

As the virus continued spreading rapidly into February, Chinese scientists published a burst of research papers on Covid-19. Then a paper by two Chinese scientists proposed without concrete evidence that the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan laboratory near the market. It was later taken down, but it raised the need for image control.

Internal documents show that the state soon began requiring all coronavirus studies in China to be approved by high-level government officials - a policy that critics say paralysed research efforts.

A notice from a China CDC lab on February 24 put in new approval processes for publication under 'important instructions' from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Other notices ordered CDC staff not to share any data, specimens or other information related to the coronavirus with outside institutions or individuals.

Then on March 2, Xi emphasised 'coordination' on coronavirus research, state media reported.

The next day, China's cabinet, the State Council, centralised all Covid-19 publication under a special task force. The notice, obtained by the AP and marked 'not to be made public,' was far more sweeping in scope than the earlier CDC notices, applying to all universities, companies and medical and research institutions.

The order said communication and publication of research had to be orchestrated like 'a game of chess' under instructions from Xi, and propaganda and public opinion teams were to 'guide publication.' It went on to warn that those who publish without permission, 'causing serious adverse social impact, shall be held accountable.'

'The regulations are very strict, and they don't make any sense,' said a former China CDC deputy director, who declined to be named because they were told not to speak to the media. 'I think it's political, because people overseas could find things being said there that might contradict what China says, so it's all being controlled.'

After the secret orders, the tide of research papers slowed to a trickle. Although China CDC researcher Liu Jun returned to the market nearly 20 times to collect some 2,000 samples over the following months, nothing was released about what they revealed.

On May 25, CDC chief Gao finally broke the silence around the market in an interview with China's Phoenix TV. He said that, unlike the environmental samples, no animal samples from the market had tested positive.

The announcement surprised scientists who didn't even know Chinese officials had taken samples from animals. It also ruled out the market as the likely source of the virus, along with further research that showed many of the first cases had no ties to it.

With the market proving a dead end, scientists turned more attention to hunting for the virus at its likely source: Bats.

Nearly a thousand miles away from the wet market in Wuhan, bats inhabit the maze of underground limestone caves in Yunnan province. With its rich, loamy soil, fog banks and dense plant growth, this area in southern China bordering Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar is one of the most biologically diverse on earth.

At one Yunnan cave visited by the AP, with thick roots hanging over the entrance, bats fluttered out at dusk and flew over the roofs of a nearby small village. White droppings splattered the ground near an altar in the rear of the cave, and Buddhist prayer strings of red and yellow twine hung from the stalactites. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred place presided over by a Buddhist monk from Thailand.

Contact like this between bats and people praying, hunting or mining in caves alarms scientists. The coronavirus' genetic code is strikingly similar to that of bat coronaviruses, and most scientists suspect Covid-19 jumped into humans either directly from a bat or via an intermediary animal.

Since bats harbouring coronaviruses are found in China and throughout Southeast Asia, the wild animal host of Covid-19 could be anywhere in the region, said Linfa Wang at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

'There is a bat somewhere with a 99.9% similar virus to the coronavirus,' Wang said. 'Bats don't respect these borders.

Covid-19 research is proceeding in countries such as Thailand, where Dr. Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, a coronavirus expert, is leading teams of scientists deep into the countryside to collect samples from bats. During one expedition in August, Supaporn told the AP the virus could be found 'anywhere' there were bats.

Chinese scientists quickly started testing potential animal hosts. Records show that Xia Xueshan, an infectious diseases expert, received a 1.4 million RMB ($214,000) grant to screen animals in Yunnan for Covid-19. State media reported in February that his team collected hundreds of samples from bats, snakes, bamboo rats and other animals, and ran a picture of masked scientists in white lab coats huddled around a large, caged porcupine.

Then the government restrictions kicked in. Data on the samples still has not been made public, and Xia did not respond to requests for an interview. Although Xia has co-authored more than a dozen papers this year, an AP review shows, only two were on Covid-19, and neither focused on its origins.

Today, the caves that scientists once surveyed are under close watch by the authorities. Security agents tailed the AP team in three locations across Yunnan, and stopped journalists from visiting the cave where researchers in 2017 identified the species of bats responsible for SARS. At an entrance to a second location, a massive cave teeming with tourists taking selfies, authorities shut the gate on the AP.

'We just got a call from the county,' said a park official, before an armed policeman showed up.

Scientists are keen to study occasions where humans may have had contact with bats as this could help to explain how the coronavirus moved from animals into people.

Particularly sensitive is the mine shaft where the closest relative of the Covid-19 virus - called 'RaTG13' - was found.

RaTG13 was discovered after an outbreak in 2012, when six men cleaning the bat-filled shaft fell ill with mysterious bouts of pneumonia, killing three. The Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China CDC both studied bat coronaviruses from this shaft. And although most scientists believe the Covid-19 virus had its origins in nature, some say it or a close relative could have been transported to Wuhan and leaked by mistake.

Wuhan Institute of Virology bat expert Shi Zhengli has repeatedly denied this theory, but Chinese authorities haven't yet allowed foreign scientists in to investigate.

Some state-backed scientists say research is proceeding as usual. Famed virologist Zhang, who received a 1.5 million RMB ($230,000) grant to search for the virus' origins, said partnering scientists are sending him samples from all over, including from bats in Guizhou in southern China and rats in Henan hundreds of miles north.

'Bats, mice, are there any new coronaviruses in them? Do they have this particular coronavirus?' Zhang said. 'We've been doing this work for over a decade. It's not like we just started today.'

Zhang declined to confirm or comment on reports that his lab was briefly closed after publishing the virus' genetic sequence ahead of authorities. He said he hasn't heard of any special restrictions on publishing papers, and the only review his papers go through is a routine scientific one by his institution.

But scientists without state backing complain that getting approval to sample animals in southern China is now extremely difficult, and that little is known about the findings of government-sponsored teams.

Even as they controlled research within China, Chinese authorities promoted theories that suggested the virus came from elsewhere.

The government gave Bi Yuhai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences scientist tapped to spearhead origins research, a 1.5 million RMB grant ($230,000), records show. A paper co-authored by Bi suggested an outbreak in a Beijing market in June could have been caused by packages of contaminated frozen fish from Europe.

China's government-controlled media used the theory to suggest the original outbreak in Wuhan could have started with seafood imported from abroad - a notion international scientists reject. WHO has said it is very unlikely that people can be infected with Covid-19 via packaged food, and that it is 'highly speculative' to suggest Covid-19 did not start in China. Bi did not respond to requests for an interview, and China has not provided enough virus samples for a definitive analysis.

The Chinese state press also has widely covered initial studies from Europe suggesting Covid-19 was found in wastewater samples in Italy and Spain last year. But scientists have largely dismissed these studies, and the researchers themselves acknowledged they did not find enough virus fragments to determine conclusively if it was the coronavirus.

And in the last few weeks, Chinese state media has taken out of context research from a German scientist, interpreting it to suggest that the pandemic began in Italy. The scientist, Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research, has said repeatedly that he believes the virus first emerged in China.

As well as clamping down on some research, the Chinese government is actively promoting fringe theories regarding the origin of the virus, the AP investigation found. Pictured: People eat in a restaurant outside of Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on November 30, 2020

China has promoted research that appears to suggest the virus may have started outside of China, despite stronger evidence to the contrary. Pictured: A worker wearing a mask peeps out behind construction barrier with a notice depicting a bat and advocating for people not to eat wild animals at the airport in Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on December 3, 2020

Internal documents show the Chinese government also has sponsored studies on the possible role of the Southeast Asian pangolin, a scaly anteater once prized in traditional Chinese medicine, as an intermediary animal host. Within the span of three days in February, Chinese scientists put out four separate papers on coronaviruses related to Covid-19 in trafficked Malayan pangolins from Southeast Asia seized by customs officials in Guangdong.

But many experts now say the theory is unlikely. Wang of the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore said the search for the coronavirus in pangolins did not appear to be 'scientifically driven.' He said blood samples would be the most conclusive evidence of Covid-19's presence in the rare mammals, and so far, no incriminating matches have been found.

WHO has said more than 500 species of other animals, including cats, ferrets and hamsters, are being studied as possible intermediary hosts for Covid-19.

The Chinese government is also limiting and controlling the search for patient zero through the re-testing of old flu samples.

Chinese hospitals collect thousands of samples from patients with flu-like symptoms every week and store them in freezers. They could easily be tested again for Covid-19, although politics could then determine whether the results are made public, said Ray Yip, the founding director of the U.S. CDC office in China.

'They'd be crazy not to do it,' Yip said. 'The political leadership will wait for that information to see, does this information make China look stupid or not?...If it makes China look stupid, they won't.'

The Chinese government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and with the military, The AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping , according to internal documents obtained by the AP. Pictured: In this Tuesday, March 10, 2020 file photo, people walk by a giant TV screen at a quiet shopping mall in Beijing broadcasting news of Chinese President Xi Jinping talking to medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province, as he visited the center of the global virus outbreak [File photo]

In the U.S., CDC officials long ago tested roughly 11,000 early samples collected under the flu surveillance program since January 1. And in Italy, researchers recently found a boy who had fallen ill in November 2019 and later tested positive for the coronavirus.

But in China, scientists have only published retrospective testing data from two Wuhan flu surveillance hospitals - out of at least 18 in Hubei province alone and well over 500 across the country. The data includes just 520 samples out of the 330,000 collected in China last year.

These enormous gaps in the research aren't due just to a lack of testing but also to a lack of transparency. Internal data obtained by the AP shows that by Febuary 6, the Hubei CDC had tested over 100 samples in Huanggang, a city southeast of Wuhan. But the results have not been made public.

The little information that has dribbled out suggests the virus was circulating well outside Wuhan in 2019 - a finding that could raise awkward questions for Chinese officials about their early handling of the outbreak. Chinese researchers found that a child hundreds of miles from Wuhan had fallen ill with the virus by January 2, suggesting it was spreading widely in December. But earlier samples weren't tested, according to a scientist with direct knowledge of the study.

'There was a very deliberate choice of the time period to study, because going too early could have been too sensitive,' said the scientist, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A WHO report written in July but published in November said Chinese authorities had identified 124 cases in December 2019, including five cases outside Wuhan. Among WHO's aims for its upcoming visit to China are reviews of hospital records before December.

Coronavirus expert Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said identifying the pandemic's source should not be used to assign guilt.

'We're all part of this together,' he said. 'And until we realise that, we're never going to get rid of this problem.'",MailOnline,"['bat', 'ap', 'researchers', 'chinese', 'scientists', 'china', 'chinas', 'hole', 'started', 'research', 'black', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'caves', 'samples']",0

Unmourned but never to be forgotten, 2020 started passing into history today with scaled-down festivities around the world as humanity bids good riddance to the year of the pandemic - although there were balloons and revelry in Wuhan where the virus began its trail of destruction 12 long months ago.

Most countries have already greeted the dawn of 2021, with the rest of the planet set to cross the invisible threshold in the coming hours.

In New Zealand, where only 25 people have ever died of Covid-19 and restrictions are virtually non-existent, crowds of partygoers packed into Auckland streets for midnight fireworks.

In Australia, which has also fended off the worst of the pandemic, life was normal enough for some revellers to gather in Melbourne and Sydney.

In the US, the year of the COVID-19 pandemic ended in with the famous ball drop in a deserted Times Square while millions watched from home, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio dancing with his wife onstage, and partygoers packing into a Miami nightclub to ring in 2021.

Small groups of revelers, some wearing glittery hats, filmed their distant view of Times Square on their phones and broke out in cheers at midnight.

And in Wuhan - where the virus first surfaced at the very end of 2019 before spiralling catastrophically around the globe - hundreds gathered at landmarks around the city to welcome in the new year.

In what is sure to spark envy in many countries still subject to strict lockdown measures, party-goers were filmed crowding into a live music event in the former-Covid epicentre.

Many opted to go mask-free inside the venue where revellers danced just inches from each other.

But for most of the world's seven billion people, a grinding year is ending with typically muted festivities, with fireworks, pyre burnings and live performances set to be watched from home or cancelled altogether.

From France to Latvia to Brazil, police and military personnel are being deployed to enforce night-time curfews and bans on large gatherings are enforced, with much of the world still in lockdown and the vaccine race only just beginning.

Although New Zealand is still isolated by international border closures, months of zero recorded cases in the community have allowed life to return to relative normality - with crowds gathering for fireworks in Auckland in scenes which would seem unthinkable to most of the world.

In Sydney, fireworks lit up the glittering harbour with a dazzling display at midnight, but few spectators were there to watch in person.

Plans to allow crowds were scrapped amid a cluster of around 150 new infections that have seen travel to and from Sydney severely restricted.

People were only allowed in Sydney city centre if they have a restaurant reservation or are one of five guests of an inner-city apartment resident. People will not be allowed in the city centre without a permit.

'I think everybody is looking towards 2021 as a fresh beginning and a fresh start,' Karen Roberts, among the lucky few who were allowed past checkpoints around the area, said at a bar near the Sydney Opera House.

Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide cancelled their displays to avoid large gatherings and possible community transmission of the virus.

Kiribati and Samoa were the first to cross the threshold of 2021 at 10am GMT, with the last Pacific islands set to follow them 26 hours later.

Although the Pacific islands were spared the worst ravages of the pandemic, border restrictions, curfews and lockdowns meant this New Year's Eve was still a little different.

At the palm-fringed Taumeasina resort in Samoa, manager Tuiataga Nathan Bucknall was pleased to be open without a limit on guest numbers, but thanks to a state of emergency stopped serving alcohol at 11 pm.

In harder-hit countries such as Italy - where shocking images of makeshift morgues and exhausted medics first awoke the world to the horror of the pandemic last spring - curfews and lockdowns are still in force.

In London, American singer-songwriter Patti Smith will ring in the New Year with a tribute to NHS workers who have died from Covid-19, projected on the screen at Piccadilly Circus and streamed on YouTube.

And in New York, the famous ball drop in Times Square will unfold this year without the usual throngs of cheering revellers. Police will block off the area so that spectators cannot even get a glimpse.

Since it surfaced in China in late 2019, the coronavirus has infected more than 80million people and led to nearly 1.8million deaths, the majority of them in Europe and the Americas.

Although mass vaccination efforts have begun in many countries in recent weeks, offering hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight, it is likely to be months before normal life can return in most of the world.

In China, where the Lunar New Year generally takes precedence over January 1, a countdown ceremony will take place in Beijing with just a few invited guests while other planned events have been cancelled.

Hong Kong, with its British colonial history and large expatriate population, has usually seen raucous celebrations along the waterfront and in bar districts.

For the second year running, however, New Year's Eve fireworks have been cancelled, this time over coronavirus rather than public security concerns.

In Japan, some people skipped what is customarily a chance to return to ancestral homes for the holidays, hoping to lessen health risks for extended families.

Rural restaurants saw business drop, while home deliveries of traditional New Year's 'good luck' food called 'osechi' boomed.

In Dubai, thousands are expected to attend a fireworks and a laser show at Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, despite a slew of new cases.

All those attending the event - whether at a public place, hotel or restaurant - will be required to wear masks and register with QR codes.

In Beirut, a city still reeling from the August 4 port explosion, authorities are also cutting loose. A night curfew has been pushed back to 3am. Bars, restaurants and night clubs have all reopened and are advertising large parties to mark the turn of the year.

Social media networks are already inundated with images and videos of packed clubs and restaurants, leading authorities to warn that a new lockdown may come into force after the holidays.

The fears of such a New Year hangover are widespread, and there are ominous signs that new strains of the virus may make the coming months even tougher.

In Brazil - which has already recorded more than 193,000 Covid-19 deaths, the second-largest number in the world - fearful medics await a new wave.

In recent days, social media has been filled with videos showing mask-less revellers enjoying a night out and television channels have even shown live images of police closing bars full of customers.

2020-12-31 07:04:57+00:00,9,"A prominent Chinese coronavirus expert has ruled out the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak hitting China, claiming it was because of the country's strong testing abilities.

Dr Zhang Wenhong, who led the fight against the virus in Shanghai, said in a Monday conference that it was 'nearly impossible' for a large-scale spread of the coronavirus to emerge in China again during the upcoming Chinese New Year in February.

His statements come as COVID-19 cases have been rising in the Chinese capital Beijing and northern China in recent days after the country appeared to have largely contained the contagion.

Dr Zhang Wenhong (pictured), who led the fight against the virus in Shanghai, said it was 'nearly impossible' for a large-scale spread of the coronavirus to emerge in China again

As of Wednesday, China has reported a total of 87,027 confirmed coronavirus infections, among which 356 are active. The death toll remains at 4,634.

Since December 18, the city of Beijing has detected 15 local transmissions, prompting the authorities to seal off parts of its north-eastern Shunyi district on Tuesday, the first lockdown in the city since the last coronavirus outbreak in June and July.

At least 50 confirmed native cases have been found in north-eastern China's Liaoning Province in the past two weeks as its capital city Shenyang announced entering 'wartime mode' today.

The recent coronavirus flare-ups have rekindled concerns while the officials urged citizens to avoid non-essential travel during the festive season between January 1 and the start of Lunar New Year in mid-February.

But Dr Zhang has reassured the public in a Monday interview that it was 'nearly impossible' for another large-scale outbreak to emerge in the country due to China's strengthened testing abilities.

'Now we have more anti-virus methods and our testing techniques are more sensitive,' the leading doctor said in a virtual conference held by the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai.

'Large-scale testing abilities have also been strengthened,' he added. 'Therefore, realistically speaking, for this Chinese New Year, a large-scale spread [of the virus] is nearly impossible.'

But Dr Zhang warned that sporadic infections could continue to appear across the country throughout the most of next year.

'Based on the current situation, the sporadic cases could last till the second half of next year,' the expert said.

China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found. Pictured, people wait in a queue to be tested for COVID-19 in Beijing on Tuesday

China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found - shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighbourhoods, and testing millions.

The Chinese capital has launched mass testing since December 23 to screen every resident of the Shunyi district, where the new cluster was found.

A total of 1.32million people have been tested and 1.3million results have come back negative, the officials reportedly said today.

2020-12-31 04:33:44+00:00,8,"An affiliate of China's state-owned drug maker Sinopharm said on Wednesday its COVID-19 vaccine showed 79.34% efficacy and it has requested regulatory approval of the shot, moving a step closer to become China's first approved vaccine for general public use.

The efficacy rate, based on an interim analysis of Phase III clinical trials, is lower than 86% rate for the same vaccine announced by the United Arab Emirates on December 9, based on preliminary data from trials there.

A spokeswoman declined to explain the discrepancy and said detailed results would be released later, without giving a timeline.

An affiliate of Sinopharm said on Wednesday its COVID-19 vaccine showed 79.34% efficacy

There have been fragmentary releases of efficacy data for Chinese vaccine makers' COVID-19 candidates, which are being considered by many developing countries for mass inoculation campaigns.

Health experts warn that piecemeal data without sufficient detail could undermine confidence in vaccines.

Turkish researchers said on Thursday their interim results from a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech showed 91.25% efficacy, only to see a confusing readout the same day from Brazil, which said the vaccine's efficacy was between 50% and 90%.

While the efficacy of the China-developed shots trails the more than 90% success rate of rival vaccines from Pfizer Inc and its partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, it points to progress China has made in the global race to develop successful COVID-19 vaccines.

China, whose President Xi Jinping has pledged to make its vaccines a global public good, has won several large supply deals with countries including Indonesia and Brazil - the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America respectively.

But none of the Chinese drug makers has yet to release detailed efficacy data.

'I think it's very positive news. The results for other COVID vaccines ... were also released initially in very short press releases, and within a few weeks more details were provided,' said Benjamin Cowling, a public health professor at the University of Hong Kong.

Experts warned, however, that it's still early to conclude how successful the Sinopharm vaccine is.

'Data can only be interpreted when key details, such as the study design, number of participants, period of observation and number of cases, are described,' said Ooi Eng Eong, an immunology professor at the National University of Singapore.

The Sinopharm vaccine is among the five most advanced candidates from China in terms of development and has been used in its emergency use programme that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people since July.

Its developer Beijing Biological Products Institute, a unit of Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG), said that it had applied to the National Medical Products Administration for conditional approval of the vaccine.

CNBG has another vaccine in late-stage trials and both have been approved for emergency use in China even as studies have not been completed.

2020-12-31 03:30:59+00:00,23,"Deep in the lush mountain valleys of southern China lies the entrance to a mine shaft that once harboured bats with the closest known relative of the Covid-19 virus.

The area is of intense scientific interest because it may hold clues to the origins of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1.7million people worldwide. Yet for scientists and journalists, it has become a black hole of no information because of political sensitivity and secrecy.

A bat research team visiting recently managed to take samples but had them confiscated, two people familiar with the matter said. Specialists in coronaviruses have been ordered not to speak to the press. And a team of Associated Press journalists was tailed by plainclothes police in multiple cars who blocked access to roads and sites in late November.

More than a year since the first known person was infected with the coronavirus, an AP investigation shows the Chinese government is strictly controlling all research into its origins, clamping down on some while actively promoting fringe theories that it could have come from outside China.

The government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and affiliated with the military, the AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping, according to internal documents obtained by The AP.

A rare leak from within the government, the dozens of pages of unpublished documents confirm what many have long suspected: The clampdown comes from the top.

As a result, very little has been made public. Authorities are severely limiting information and impeding cooperation with international scientists.

'What did they find?' asked Gregory Gray, a Duke University epidemiologist who oversees a lab in China studying the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to people. 'Maybe their data were not conclusive, or maybe they suppressed the data for some political reason. I don't know...I wish I did.'

Unprecedented restrictions on research mean that many studies done into Covid-19 in China are yet to be published. Pictured: A man shines a light in the abandoned Wanling cave near Manhaguo village in southern China's Yunnan province on Wednesday, December 2, 2020. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred altar presided over by a Buddhist monk - precisely the kind of contact between bats and people that alarms scientists

The AP investigation was based on dozens of interviews with Chinese and foreign scientists and officials, along with public notices, leaked emails, internal data and the documents from China's cabinet and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It reveals a pattern of government secrecy and top-down control that has been evident throughout the pandemic.

As the AP previously documented, this culture has delayed warnings about the pandemic, blocked the sharing of information with the World Health Organization and hampered early testing. Scientists familiar with China's public health system say the same practices apply to sensitive research.

'They only select people they can trust, those that they can control,' said a public health expert who works regularly with the China CDC, declining to be identified out of fear of retribution. 'Military teams and others are working hard on this, but whether it gets published all depends on the outcome.'

The pandemic has crippled Beijing's reputation on the global stage, and China's leaders are wary of any findings that could suggest they were negligent in its spread. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Health Commission, which are managing research into the coronavirus' origins, did not respond to requests for comment.

'The novel coronavirus has been discovered in many parts of the world,' China's foreign ministry said in a fax. 'Scientists should carry out international scientific research and cooperation on a global scale.'

Some Chinese scientists say little has been shared simply because nothing of significance has been discovered.

'We've been looking, but we haven't found it,' said Zhang Yongzhen, a renowned Chinese virologist.

China's leaders are far from alone in politicising research into the origins of the virus. In April, President Donald Trump shelved a U.S.-funded project to identify dangerous animal diseases in China and Southeast Asia, effectively severing ties between Chinese and American scientists and complicating the search for virus origins.

Trump also has accused China of setting off the pandemic through an accident at a Wuhan lab - a theory that some experts say cannot be ruled out but as yet has no evidence behind it.

Research into Covid-19's origins is critical to the prevention of future pandemics. Although a World Health Organization international team plans to visit China in early January to investigate what started the pandemic, its members and agenda had to be approved by China.

Some public health experts warn that China's refusal to grant further access to international scientists has jeopardised the global collaboration that pinpointed the source of the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago. Jonna Mazet, a founding executive director of the UC Davis One Health Institute, said the lack of collaboration between Chinese and U.S. scientists was 'a disappointment' and the inability of American scientists to work in China 'devastating.'

'There's so much speculation around the origins of this virus,' Mazet said. 'We need to step back...and let scientists get the real answer without the finger-pointing.'

The hidden hunt for the origins of Covid-19 shows how the Chinese government has tried to steer the narrative.

The search started in the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan, a sprawling, low-slung complex where many of the first human coronavirus cases were detected. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market, such as civet cats implicated in the spread of SARS.

In mid-December last year, Huanan vendor Jiang Dafa started noticing people were falling ill. Among the first was a part-time worker in his 60s who helped clean carcasses at a stall; soon, a friend he played chess with also fell ill. A third, a seafood monger in his 40s, was infected and later died.

Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market.

Patients began trickling into nearby hospitals, triggering alarms by late December that alerted the China CDC. CDC chief Gao Fu immediately sent a team to investigate.

At first, research appeared to be moving swiftly.

Overnight on January 1, the market suddenly was ordered shut, barring vendors from fetching their belongings, Jiang said. China CDC researchers collected 585 environmental samples from door handles, sewage and the floor of the market, and authorities sprayed the complex down with sanitiser. Later, they would cart out everything inside and incinerate it.

Internal China CDC data obtained by the AP shows that by January 10 and 11, researchers were sequencing dozens of environmental samples from Wuhan. Gary Kobinger, a Canadian microbiologist advising WHO, emailed his colleagues to share his concerns that the virus originated at the market.

'This corona(virus) is very close to SARS,' he wrote on January 13. 'If we put aside an accident...then I would look at the bats in these markets (sold and 'wild').'

By late January, Chinese state media announced that 33 of the environmental samples had tested positive. In a report to WHO, officials said 11 specimens were more than 99% similar to the new coronavirus. They also told the U.N. health agency that rats and mice were common in the market, and that most of the positive samples were clustered in an area where vendors traded in wildlife.

In the meantime, Jiang avoided telling people he worked at Huanan because of the stigma. He criticised the political tussle between China and the U.S.

'It's pointless to blame anyone for this disease,' Jiang said.

As the virus continued spreading rapidly into February, Chinese scientists published a burst of research papers on Covid-19. Then a paper by two Chinese scientists proposed without concrete evidence that the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan laboratory near the market. It was later taken down, but it raised the need for image control.

Internal documents show that the state soon began requiring all coronavirus studies in China to be approved by high-level government officials - a policy that critics say paralysed research efforts.

A notice from a China CDC lab on February 24 put in new approval processes for publication under 'important instructions' from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Other notices ordered CDC staff not to share any data, specimens or other information related to the coronavirus with outside institutions or individuals.

Then on March 2, Xi emphasised 'coordination' on coronavirus research, state media reported.

The next day, China's cabinet, the State Council, centralised all Covid-19 publication under a special task force. The notice, obtained by the AP and marked 'not to be made public,' was far more sweeping in scope than the earlier CDC notices, applying to all universities, companies and medical and research institutions.

The order said communication and publication of research had to be orchestrated like 'a game of chess' under instructions from Xi, and propaganda and public opinion teams were to 'guide publication.' It went on to warn that those who publish without permission, 'causing serious adverse social impact, shall be held accountable.'

'The regulations are very strict, and they don't make any sense,' said a former China CDC deputy director, who declined to be named because they were told not to speak to the media. 'I think it's political, because people overseas could find things being said there that might contradict what China says, so it's all being controlled.'

After the secret orders, the tide of research papers slowed to a trickle. Although China CDC researcher Liu Jun returned to the market nearly 20 times to collect some 2,000 samples over the following months, nothing was released about what they revealed.

On May 25, CDC chief Gao finally broke the silence around the market in an interview with China's Phoenix TV. He said that, unlike the environmental samples, no animal samples from the market had tested positive.

The announcement surprised scientists who didn't even know Chinese officials had taken samples from animals. It also ruled out the market as the likely source of the virus, along with further research that showed many of the first cases had no ties to it.

With the market proving a dead end, scientists turned more attention to hunting for the virus at its likely source: Bats.

Nearly a thousand miles away from the wet market in Wuhan, bats inhabit the maze of underground limestone caves in Yunnan province. With its rich, loamy soil, fog banks and dense plant growth, this area in southern China bordering Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar is one of the most biologically diverse on earth.

At one Yunnan cave visited by the AP, with thick roots hanging over the entrance, bats fluttered out at dusk and flew over the roofs of a nearby small village. White droppings splattered the ground near an altar in the rear of the cave, and Buddhist prayer strings of red and yellow twine hung from the stalactites. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred place presided over by a Buddhist monk from Thailand.

Contact like this between bats and people praying, hunting or mining in caves alarms scientists. The coronavirus' genetic code is strikingly similar to that of bat coronaviruses, and most scientists suspect Covid-19 jumped into humans either directly from a bat or via an intermediary animal.

Since bats harbouring coronaviruses are found in China and throughout Southeast Asia, the wild animal host of Covid-19 could be anywhere in the region, said Linfa Wang at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

'There is a bat somewhere with a 99.9% similar virus to the coronavirus,' Wang said. 'Bats don't respect these borders.

Covid-19 research is proceeding in countries such as Thailand, where Dr. Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, a coronavirus expert, is leading teams of scientists deep into the countryside to collect samples from bats. During one expedition in August, Supaporn told the AP the virus could be found 'anywhere' there were bats.

Chinese scientists quickly started testing potential animal hosts. Records show that Xia Xueshan, an infectious diseases expert, received a 1.4 million RMB ($214,000) grant to screen animals in Yunnan for Covid-19. State media reported in February that his team collected hundreds of samples from bats, snakes, bamboo rats and other animals, and ran a picture of masked scientists in white lab coats huddled around a large, caged porcupine.

Then the government restrictions kicked in. Data on the samples still has not been made public, and Xia did not respond to requests for an interview. Although Xia has co-authored more than a dozen papers this year, an AP review shows, only two were on Covid-19, and neither focused on its origins.

Today, the caves that scientists once surveyed are under close watch by the authorities. Security agents tailed the AP team in three locations across Yunnan, and stopped journalists from visiting the cave where researchers in 2017 identified the species of bats responsible for SARS. At an entrance to a second location, a massive cave teeming with tourists taking selfies, authorities shut the gate on the AP.

'We just got a call from the county,' said a park official, before an armed policeman showed up.

Scientists are keen to study occasions where humans may have had contact with bats as this could help to explain how the coronavirus moved from animals into people.

Particularly sensitive is the mine shaft where the closest relative of the Covid-19 virus - called 'RaTG13' - was found.

RaTG13 was discovered after an outbreak in 2012, when six men cleaning the bat-filled shaft fell ill with mysterious bouts of pneumonia, killing three. The Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China CDC both studied bat coronaviruses from this shaft. And although most scientists believe the Covid-19 virus had its origins in nature, some say it or a close relative could have been transported to Wuhan and leaked by mistake.

Wuhan Institute of Virology bat expert Shi Zhengli has repeatedly denied this theory, but Chinese authorities haven't yet allowed foreign scientists in to investigate.

Some state-backed scientists say research is proceeding as usual. Famed virologist Zhang, who received a 1.5 million RMB ($230,000) grant to search for the virus' origins, said partnering scientists are sending him samples from all over, including from bats in Guizhou in southern China and rats in Henan hundreds of miles north.

'Bats, mice, are there any new coronaviruses in them? Do they have this particular coronavirus?' Zhang said. 'We've been doing this work for over a decade. It's not like we just started today.'

Zhang declined to confirm or comment on reports that his lab was briefly closed after publishing the virus' genetic sequence ahead of authorities. He said he hasn't heard of any special restrictions on publishing papers, and the only review his papers go through is a routine scientific one by his institution.

But scientists without state backing complain that getting approval to sample animals in southern China is now extremely difficult, and that little is known about the findings of government-sponsored teams.

Even as they controlled research within China, Chinese authorities promoted theories that suggested the virus came from elsewhere.

The government gave Bi Yuhai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences scientist tapped to spearhead origins research, a 1.5 million RMB grant ($230,000), records show. A paper co-authored by Bi suggested an outbreak in a Beijing market in June could have been caused by packages of contaminated frozen fish from Europe.

China's government-controlled media used the theory to suggest the original outbreak in Wuhan could have started with seafood imported from abroad - a notion international scientists reject. WHO has said it is very unlikely that people can be infected with Covid-19 via packaged food, and that it is 'highly speculative' to suggest Covid-19 did not start in China. Bi did not respond to requests for an interview, and China has not provided enough virus samples for a definitive analysis.

The Chinese state press also has widely covered initial studies from Europe suggesting Covid-19 was found in wastewater samples in Italy and Spain last year. But scientists have largely dismissed these studies, and the researchers themselves acknowledged they did not find enough virus fragments to determine conclusively if it was the coronavirus.

And in the last few weeks, Chinese state media has taken out of context research from a German scientist, interpreting it to suggest that the pandemic began in Italy. The scientist, Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research, has said repeatedly that he believes the virus first emerged in China.

As well as clamping down on some research, the Chinese government is actively promoting fringe theories regarding the origin of the virus, the AP investigation found. Pictured: People eat in a restaurant outside of Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on November 30, 2020

China has promoted research that appears to suggest the virus may have started outside of China, despite stronger evidence to the contrary. Pictured: A worker wearing a mask peeps out behind construction barrier with a notice depicting a bat and advocating for people not to eat wild animals at the airport in Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on December 3, 2020

Internal documents show the Chinese government also has sponsored studies on the possible role of the Southeast Asian pangolin, a scaly anteater once prized in traditional Chinese medicine, as an intermediary animal host. Within the span of three days in February, Chinese scientists put out four separate papers on coronaviruses related to Covid-19 in trafficked Malayan pangolins from Southeast Asia seized by customs officials in Guangdong.

But many experts now say the theory is unlikely. Wang of the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore said the search for the coronavirus in pangolins did not appear to be 'scientifically driven.' He said blood samples would be the most conclusive evidence of Covid-19's presence in the rare mammals, and so far, no incriminating matches have been found.

WHO has said more than 500 species of other animals, including cats, ferrets and hamsters, are being studied as possible intermediary hosts for Covid-19.

The Chinese government is also limiting and controlling the search for patient zero through the re-testing of old flu samples.

Chinese hospitals collect thousands of samples from patients with flu-like symptoms every week and store them in freezers. They could easily be tested again for Covid-19, although politics could then determine whether the results are made public, said Ray Yip, the founding director of the U.S. CDC office in China.

'They'd be crazy not to do it,' Yip said. 'The political leadership will wait for that information to see, does this information make China look stupid or not?...If it makes China look stupid, they won't.'

The Chinese government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and with the military, The AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping , according to internal documents obtained by the AP. Pictured: In this Tuesday, March 10, 2020 file photo, people walk by a giant TV screen at a quiet shopping mall in Beijing broadcasting news of Chinese President Xi Jinping talking to medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province, as he visited the center of the global virus outbreak [File photo]

In the U.S., CDC officials long ago tested roughly 11,000 early samples collected under the flu surveillance program since January 1. And in Italy, researchers recently found a boy who had fallen ill in November 2019 and later tested positive for the coronavirus.

But in China, scientists have only published retrospective testing data from two Wuhan flu surveillance hospitals - out of at least 18 in Hubei province alone and well over 500 across the country. The data includes just 520 samples out of the 330,000 collected in China last year.

These enormous gaps in the research aren't due just to a lack of testing but also to a lack of transparency. Internal data obtained by the AP shows that by Febuary 6, the Hubei CDC had tested over 100 samples in Huanggang, a city southeast of Wuhan. But the results have not been made public.

The little information that has dribbled out suggests the virus was circulating well outside Wuhan in 2019 - a finding that could raise awkward questions for Chinese officials about their early handling of the outbreak. Chinese researchers found that a child hundreds of miles from Wuhan had fallen ill with the virus by January 2, suggesting it was spreading widely in December. But earlier samples weren't tested, according to a scientist with direct knowledge of the study.

'There was a very deliberate choice of the time period to study, because going too early could have been too sensitive,' said the scientist, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A WHO report written in July but published in November said Chinese authorities had identified 124 cases in December 2019, including five cases outside Wuhan. Among WHO's aims for its upcoming visit to China are reviews of hospital records before December.

Coronavirus expert Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said identifying the pandemic's source should not be used to assign guilt.

As of Wednesday, China has reported a total of 87,027 confirmed coronavirus infections, among which 356 are active. The death toll remains at 4,634.

Since December 18, the city of Beijing has detected 15 local transmissions, prompting the authorities to seal off parts of its north-eastern Shunyi district on Tuesday, the first lockdown in the city since the last coronavirus outbreak in June and July.

At least 50 confirmed native cases have been found in north-eastern China's Liaoning Province in the past two weeks as its capital city Shenyang announced entering 'wartime mode' today.

The recent coronavirus flare-ups have rekindled concerns while the officials urged citizens to avoid non-essential travel during the festive season between January 1 and the start of Lunar New Year in mid-February.

But Dr Zhang has reassured the public in a Monday interview that it was 'nearly impossible' for another large-scale outbreak to emerge in the country due to China's strengthened testing abilities.

The area is of intense scientific interest because it may hold clues to the origins of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1.7million people worldwide. Yet for scientists and journalists, it has become a black hole of no information because of political sensitivity and secrecy.

A bat research team visiting recently managed to take samples but had them confiscated, two people familiar with the matter said. Specialists in coronaviruses have been ordered not to speak to the press. And a team of Associated Press journalists was tailed by plainclothes police in multiple cars who blocked access to roads and sites in late November.

More than a year since the first known person was infected with the coronavirus, an AP investigation shows the Chinese government is strictly controlling all research into its origins, clamping down on some while actively promoting fringe theories that it could have come from outside China.

The government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and affiliated with the military, the AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping, according to internal documents obtained by The AP.

A rare leak from within the government, the dozens of pages of unpublished documents confirm what many have long suspected: The clampdown comes from the top.

As a result, very little has been made public. Authorities are severely limiting information and impeding cooperation with international scientists.

'What did they find?' asked Gregory Gray, a Duke University epidemiologist who oversees a lab in China studying the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to people. 'Maybe their data were not conclusive, or maybe they suppressed the data for some political reason. I don't know...I wish I did.'

Unprecedented restrictions on research mean that many studies done into Covid-19 in China are yet to be published. Pictured: A man shines a light in the abandoned Wanling cave near Manhaguo village in southern China's Yunnan province on Wednesday, December 2, 2020. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred altar presided over by a Buddhist monk - precisely the kind of contact between bats and people that alarms scientists

The AP investigation was based on dozens of interviews with Chinese and foreign scientists and officials, along with public notices, leaked emails, internal data and the documents from China's cabinet and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It reveals a pattern of government secrecy and top-down control that has been evident throughout the pandemic.

As the AP previously documented, this culture has delayed warnings about the pandemic, blocked the sharing of information with the World Health Organization and hampered early testing. Scientists familiar with China's public health system say the same practices apply to sensitive research.

'They only select people they can trust, those that they can control,' said a public health expert who works regularly with the China CDC, declining to be identified out of fear of retribution. 'Military teams and others are working hard on this, but whether it gets published all depends on the outcome.'

The pandemic has crippled Beijing's reputation on the global stage, and China's leaders are wary of any findings that could suggest they were negligent in its spread. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Health Commission, which are managing research into the coronavirus' origins, did not respond to requests for comment.

'The novel coronavirus has been discovered in many parts of the world,' China's foreign ministry said in a fax. 'Scientists should carry out international scientific research and cooperation on a global scale.'

Some Chinese scientists say little has been shared simply because nothing of significance has been discovered.

'We've been looking, but we haven't found it,' said Zhang Yongzhen, a renowned Chinese virologist.

China's leaders are far from alone in politicising research into the origins of the virus. In April, President Donald Trump shelved a U.S.-funded project to identify dangerous animal diseases in China and Southeast Asia, effectively severing ties between Chinese and American scientists and complicating the search for virus origins.

Trump also has accused China of setting off the pandemic through an accident at a Wuhan lab - a theory that some experts say cannot be ruled out but as yet has no evidence behind it.

Research into Covid-19's origins is critical to the prevention of future pandemics. Although a World Health Organization international team plans to visit China in early January to investigate what started the pandemic, its members and agenda had to be approved by China.

Some public health experts warn that China's refusal to grant further access to international scientists has jeopardised the global collaboration that pinpointed the source of the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago. Jonna Mazet, a founding executive director of the UC Davis One Health Institute, said the lack of collaboration between Chinese and U.S. scientists was 'a disappointment' and the inability of American scientists to work in China 'devastating.'

'There's so much speculation around the origins of this virus,' Mazet said. 'We need to step back...and let scientists get the real answer without the finger-pointing.'

The hidden hunt for the origins of Covid-19 shows how the Chinese government has tried to steer the narrative.

The search started in the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan, a sprawling, low-slung complex where many of the first human coronavirus cases were detected. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market, such as civet cats implicated in the spread of SARS.

In mid-December last year, Huanan vendor Jiang Dafa started noticing people were falling ill. Among the first was a part-time worker in his 60s who helped clean carcasses at a stall; soon, a friend he played chess with also fell ill. A third, a seafood monger in his 40s, was infected and later died.

Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market.

Patients began trickling into nearby hospitals, triggering alarms by late December that alerted the China CDC. CDC chief Gao Fu immediately sent a team to investigate.

At first, research appeared to be moving swiftly.

Overnight on January 1, the market suddenly was ordered shut, barring vendors from fetching their belongings, Jiang said. China CDC researchers collected 585 environmental samples from door handles, sewage and the floor of the market, and authorities sprayed the complex down with sanitiser. Later, they would cart out everything inside and incinerate it.

Internal China CDC data obtained by the AP shows that by January 10 and 11, researchers were sequencing dozens of environmental samples from Wuhan. Gary Kobinger, a Canadian microbiologist advising WHO, emailed his colleagues to share his concerns that the virus originated at the market.

'This corona(virus) is very close to SARS,' he wrote on January 13. 'If we put aside an accident...then I would look at the bats in these markets (sold and 'wild').'

By late January, Chinese state media announced that 33 of the environmental samples had tested positive. In a report to WHO, officials said 11 specimens were more than 99% similar to the new coronavirus. They also told the U.N. health agency that rats and mice were common in the market, and that most of the positive samples were clustered in an area where vendors traded in wildlife.

In the meantime, Jiang avoided telling people he worked at Huanan because of the stigma. He criticised the political tussle between China and the U.S.

'It's pointless to blame anyone for this disease,' Jiang said.

As the virus continued spreading rapidly into February, Chinese scientists published a burst of research papers on Covid-19. Then a paper by two Chinese scientists proposed without concrete evidence that the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan laboratory near the market. It was later taken down, but it raised the need for image control.

Internal documents show that the state soon began requiring all coronavirus studies in China to be approved by high-level government officials - a policy that critics say paralysed research efforts.

A notice from a China CDC lab on February 24 put in new approval processes for publication under 'important instructions' from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Other notices ordered CDC staff not to share any data, specimens or other information related to the coronavirus with outside institutions or individuals.

Then on March 2, Xi emphasised 'coordination' on coronavirus research, state media reported.

The next day, China's cabinet, the State Council, centralised all Covid-19 publication under a special task force. The notice, obtained by the AP and marked 'not to be made public,' was far more sweeping in scope than the earlier CDC notices, applying to all universities, companies and medical and research institutions.

The order said communication and publication of research had to be orchestrated like 'a game of chess' under instructions from Xi, and propaganda and public opinion teams were to 'guide publication.' It went on to warn that those who publish without permission, 'causing serious adverse social impact, shall be held accountable.'

'The regulations are very strict, and they don't make any sense,' said a former China CDC deputy director, who declined to be named because they were told not to speak to the media. 'I think it's political, because people overseas could find things being said there that might contradict what China says, so it's all being controlled.'

After the secret orders, the tide of research papers slowed to a trickle. Although China CDC researcher Liu Jun returned to the market nearly 20 times to collect some 2,000 samples over the following months, nothing was released about what they revealed.

On May 25, CDC chief Gao finally broke the silence around the market in an interview with China's Phoenix TV. He said that, unlike the environmental samples, no animal samples from the market had tested positive.

The announcement surprised scientists who didn't even know Chinese officials had taken samples from animals. It also ruled out the market as the likely source of the virus, along with further research that showed many of the first cases had no ties to it.

With the market proving a dead end, scientists turned more attention to hunting for the virus at its likely source: Bats.

Nearly a thousand miles away from the wet market in Wuhan, bats inhabit the maze of underground limestone caves in Yunnan province. With its rich, loamy soil, fog banks and dense plant growth, this area in southern China bordering Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar is one of the most biologically diverse on earth.

At one Yunnan cave visited by the AP, with thick roots hanging over the entrance, bats fluttered out at dusk and flew over the roofs of a nearby small village. White droppings splattered the ground near an altar in the rear of the cave, and Buddhist prayer strings of red and yellow twine hung from the stalactites. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred place presided over by a Buddhist monk from Thailand.

Contact like this between bats and people praying, hunting or mining in caves alarms scientists. The coronavirus' genetic code is strikingly similar to that of bat coronaviruses, and most scientists suspect Covid-19 jumped into humans either directly from a bat or via an intermediary animal.

Since bats harbouring coronaviruses are found in China and throughout Southeast Asia, the wild animal host of Covid-19 could be anywhere in the region, said Linfa Wang at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

'There is a bat somewhere with a 99.9% similar virus to the coronavirus,' Wang said. 'Bats don't respect these borders.

Covid-19 research is proceeding in countries such as Thailand, where Dr. Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, a coronavirus expert, is leading teams of scientists deep into the countryside to collect samples from bats. During one expedition in August, Supaporn told the AP the virus could be found 'anywhere' there were bats.

Chinese scientists quickly started testing potential animal hosts. Records show that Xia Xueshan, an infectious diseases expert, received a 1.4 million RMB ($214,000) grant to screen animals in Yunnan for Covid-19. State media reported in February that his team collected hundreds of samples from bats, snakes, bamboo rats and other animals, and ran a picture of masked scientists in white lab coats huddled around a large, caged porcupine.

Then the government restrictions kicked in. Data on the samples still has not been made public, and Xia did not respond to requests for an interview. Although Xia has co-authored more than a dozen papers this year, an AP review shows, only two were on Covid-19, and neither focused on its origins.

Today, the caves that scientists once surveyed are under close watch by the authorities. Security agents tailed the AP team in three locations across Yunnan, and stopped journalists from visiting the cave where researchers in 2017 identified the species of bats responsible for SARS. At an entrance to a second location, a massive cave teeming with tourists taking selfies, authorities shut the gate on the AP.

'We just got a call from the county,' said a park official, before an armed policeman showed up.

Scientists are keen to study occasions where humans may have had contact with bats as this could help to explain how the coronavirus moved from animals into people.

Particularly sensitive is the mine shaft where the closest relative of the Covid-19 virus - called 'RaTG13' - was found.

RaTG13 was discovered after an outbreak in 2012, when six men cleaning the bat-filled shaft fell ill with mysterious bouts of pneumonia, killing three. The Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China CDC both studied bat coronaviruses from this shaft. And although most scientists believe the Covid-19 virus had its origins in nature, some say it or a close relative could have been transported to Wuhan and leaked by mistake.

Wuhan Institute of Virology bat expert Shi Zhengli has repeatedly denied this theory, but Chinese authorities haven't yet allowed foreign scientists in to investigate.

Some state-backed scientists say research is proceeding as usual. Famed virologist Zhang, who received a 1.5 million RMB ($230,000) grant to search for the virus' origins, said partnering scientists are sending him samples from all over, including from bats in Guizhou in southern China and rats in Henan hundreds of miles north.

'Bats, mice, are there any new coronaviruses in them? Do they have this particular coronavirus?' Zhang said. 'We've been doing this work for over a decade. It's not like we just started today.'

Zhang declined to confirm or comment on reports that his lab was briefly closed after publishing the virus' genetic sequence ahead of authorities. He said he hasn't heard of any special restrictions on publishing papers, and the only review his papers go through is a routine scientific one by his institution.

But scientists without state backing complain that getting approval to sample animals in southern China is now extremely difficult, and that little is known about the findings of government-sponsored teams.

Even as they controlled research within China, Chinese authorities promoted theories that suggested the virus came from elsewhere.

The government gave Bi Yuhai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences scientist tapped to spearhead origins research, a 1.5 million RMB grant ($230,000), records show. A paper co-authored by Bi suggested an outbreak in a Beijing market in June could have been caused by packages of contaminated frozen fish from Europe.

China's government-controlled media used the theory to suggest the original outbreak in Wuhan could have started with seafood imported from abroad - a notion international scientists reject. WHO has said it is very unlikely that people can be infected with Covid-19 via packaged food, and that it is 'highly speculative' to suggest Covid-19 did not start in China. Bi did not respond to requests for an interview, and China has not provided enough virus samples for a definitive analysis.

The Chinese state press also has widely covered initial studies from Europe suggesting Covid-19 was found in wastewater samples in Italy and Spain last year. But scientists have largely dismissed these studies, and the researchers themselves acknowledged they did not find enough virus fragments to determine conclusively if it was the coronavirus.

And in the last few weeks, Chinese state media has taken out of context research from a German scientist, interpreting it to suggest that the pandemic began in Italy. The scientist, Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research, has said repeatedly that he believes the virus first emerged in China.

As well as clamping down on some research, the Chinese government is actively promoting fringe theories regarding the origin of the virus, the AP investigation found. Pictured: People eat in a restaurant outside of Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on November 30, 2020

China has promoted research that appears to suggest the virus may have started outside of China, despite stronger evidence to the contrary. Pictured: A worker wearing a mask peeps out behind construction barrier with a notice depicting a bat and advocating for people not to eat wild animals at the airport in Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on December 3, 2020

Internal documents show the Chinese government also has sponsored studies on the possible role of the Southeast Asian pangolin, a scaly anteater once prized in traditional Chinese medicine, as an intermediary animal host. Within the span of three days in February, Chinese scientists put out four separate papers on coronaviruses related to Covid-19 in trafficked Malayan pangolins from Southeast Asia seized by customs officials in Guangdong.

But many experts now say the theory is unlikely. Wang of the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore said the search for the coronavirus in pangolins did not appear to be 'scientifically driven.' He said blood samples would be the most conclusive evidence of Covid-19's presence in the rare mammals, and so far, no incriminating matches have been found.

WHO has said more than 500 species of other animals, including cats, ferrets and hamsters, are being studied as possible intermediary hosts for Covid-19.

The Chinese government is also limiting and controlling the search for patient zero through the re-testing of old flu samples.

Chinese hospitals collect thousands of samples from patients with flu-like symptoms every week and store them in freezers. They could easily be tested again for Covid-19, although politics could then determine whether the results are made public, said Ray Yip, the founding director of the U.S. CDC office in China.

'They'd be crazy not to do it,' Yip said. 'The political leadership will wait for that information to see, does this information make China look stupid or not?...If it makes China look stupid, they won't.'

The Chinese government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and with the military, The AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping , according to internal documents obtained by the AP. Pictured: In this Tuesday, March 10, 2020 file photo, people walk by a giant TV screen at a quiet shopping mall in Beijing broadcasting news of Chinese President Xi Jinping talking to medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province, as he visited the center of the global virus outbreak [File photo]

In the U.S., CDC officials long ago tested roughly 11,000 early samples collected under the flu surveillance program since January 1. And in Italy, researchers recently found a boy who had fallen ill in November 2019 and later tested positive for the coronavirus.

But in China, scientists have only published retrospective testing data from two Wuhan flu surveillance hospitals - out of at least 18 in Hubei province alone and well over 500 across the country. The data includes just 520 samples out of the 330,000 collected in China last year.

These enormous gaps in the research aren't due just to a lack of testing but also to a lack of transparency. Internal data obtained by the AP shows that by Febuary 6, the Hubei CDC had tested over 100 samples in Huanggang, a city southeast of Wuhan. But the results have not been made public.

The little information that has dribbled out suggests the virus was circulating well outside Wuhan in 2019 - a finding that could raise awkward questions for Chinese officials about their early handling of the outbreak. Chinese researchers found that a child hundreds of miles from Wuhan had fallen ill with the virus by January 2, suggesting it was spreading widely in December. But earlier samples weren't tested, according to a scientist with direct knowledge of the study.

'There was a very deliberate choice of the time period to study, because going too early could have been too sensitive,' said the scientist, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A WHO report written in July but published in November said Chinese authorities had identified 124 cases in December 2019, including five cases outside Wuhan. Among WHO's aims for its upcoming visit to China are reviews of hospital records before December.

Coronavirus expert Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said identifying the pandemic's source should not be used to assign guilt.

'We're all part of this together,' he said.

The efficacy rate, based on an interim analysis of Phase III clinical trials, is lower than 86% rate for the same vaccine announced by the United Arab Emirates on December 9, based on preliminary data from trials there.

A spokeswoman declined to explain the discrepancy and said detailed results would be released later, without giving a timeline.

There have been fragmentary releases of efficacy data for Chinese vaccine makers' COVID-19 candidates, which are being considered by many developing countries for mass inoculation campaigns.

Health experts warn that piecemeal data without sufficient detail could undermine confidence in vaccines.

Turkish researchers said on Thursday their interim results from a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech showed 91.25% efficacy, only to see a confusing readout the same day from Brazil, which said the vaccine's efficacy was between 50% and 90%.

While the efficacy of the China-developed shots trails the more than 90% success rate of rival vaccines from Pfizer Inc and its partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, it points to progress China has made in the global race to develop successful COVID-19 vaccines.

China, whose President Xi Jinping has pledged to make its vaccines a global public good, has won several large supply deals with countries including Indonesia and Brazil - the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America respectively.

But none of the Chinese drug makers has yet to release detailed efficacy data.

'I think it's very positive news. The results for other COVID vaccines ... were also released initially in very short press releases, and within a few weeks more details were provided,' said Benjamin Cowling, a public health professor at the University of Hong Kong.

Experts warned, however, that it's still early to conclude how successful the Sinopharm vaccine is.

'Data can only be interpreted when key details, such as the study design, number of participants, period of observation and number of cases, are described,' said Ooi Eng Eong, an immunology professor at the National University of Singapore.

Dr Zhang Wenhong, who led the fight against the virus in Shanghai, said in a Monday conference that it was 'nearly impossible' for a large-scale spread of the coronavirus to emerge in China again during the upcoming Chinese New Year in February.

His statements come as COVID-19 cases have been rising in the Chinese capital Beijing and northern China in recent days after the country appeared to have largely contained the contagion.

As of Wednesday, China has reported a total of 87,027 confirmed coronavirus infections, among which 356 are active. The death toll remains at 4,634.

Since December 18, the city of Beijing has detected 15 local transmissions, prompting the authorities to seal off parts of its north-eastern Shunyi district on Tuesday, the first lockdown in the city since the last coronavirus outbreak in June and July.

At least 50 confirmed native cases have been found in north-eastern China's Liaoning Province in the past two weeks as its capital city Shenyang announced entering 'wartime mode' today.

The recent coronavirus flare-ups have rekindled concerns while the officials urged citizens to avoid non-essential travel during the festive season between January 1 and the start of Lunar New Year in mid-February.

But Dr Zhang has reassured the public in a Monday interview that it was 'nearly impossible' for another large-scale outbreak to emerge in the country due to China's strengthened testing abilities.

'Now we have more anti-virus methods and our testing techniques are more sensitive,' the leading doctor said in a virtual conference held by the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai.

'Large-scale testing abilities have also been strengthened,' he added. 'Therefore, realistically speaking, for this Chinese New Year, a large-scale spread [of the virus] is nearly impossible.'

But Dr Zhang warned that sporadic infections could continue to appear across the country throughout the most of next year.

'Based on the current situation, the sporadic cases could last till the second half of next year,' the expert said.

Unprecedented restrictions on research mean that many studies done into Covid-19 in China are yet to be published.

The AP investigation was based on dozens of interviews with Chinese and foreign scientists and officials, along with public notices, leaked emails, internal data and the documents from China's cabinet and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It reveals a pattern of government secrecy and top-down control that has been evident throughout the pandemic.

As the AP previously documented, this culture has delayed warnings about the pandemic, blocked the sharing of information with the World Health Organization and hampered early testing. Scientists familiar with China's public health system say the same practices apply to sensitive research.

'They only select people they can trust, those that they can control,' said a public health expert who works regularly with the China CDC, declining to be identified out of fear of retribution. 'Military teams and others are working hard on this, but whether it gets published all depends on the outcome.'

The pandemic has crippled Beijing's reputation on the global stage, and China's leaders are wary of any findings that could suggest they were negligent in its spread. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Health Commission, which are managing research into the coronavirus' origins, did not respond to requests for comment.

'The novel coronavirus has been discovered in many parts of the world,' China's foreign ministry said in a fax. 'Scientists should carry out international scientific research and cooperation on a global scale.'

Some Chinese scientists say little has been shared simply because nothing of significance has been discovered.

'We've been looking, but we haven't found it,' said Zhang Yongzhen, a renowned Chinese virologist.

China's leaders are far from alone in politicising research into the origins of the virus. In April, President Donald Trump shelved a U.S.-funded project to identify dangerous animal diseases in China and Southeast Asia, effectively severing ties between Chinese and American scientists and complicating the search for virus origins.

Trump also has accused China of setting off the pandemic through an accident at a Wuhan lab - a theory that some experts say cannot be ruled out but as yet has no evidence behind it.

Research into Covid-19's origins is critical to the prevention of future pandemics. Although a World Health Organization international team plans to visit China in early January to investigate what started the pandemic, its members and agenda had to be approved by China.

Some public health experts warn that China's refusal to grant further access to international scientists has jeopardised the global collaboration that pinpointed the source of the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago. Jonna Mazet, a founding executive director of the UC Davis One Health Institute, said the lack of collaboration between Chinese and U.S. scientists was 'a disappointment' and the inability of American scientists to work in China 'devastating.'

'There's so much speculation around the origins of this virus,' Mazet said. 'We need to step back...and let scientists get the real answer without the finger-pointing.'

The hidden hunt for the origins of Covid-19 shows how the Chinese government has tried to steer the narrative.

The search started in the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan, a sprawling, low-slung complex where many of the first human coronavirus cases were detected. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market, such as civet cats implicated in the spread of SARS.

In mid-December last year, Huanan vendor Jiang Dafa started noticing people were falling ill. Among the first was a part-time worker in his 60s who helped clean carcasses at a stall; soon, a friend he played chess with also fell ill. A third, a seafood monger in his 40s, was infected and later died.

Patients began trickling into nearby hospitals, triggering alarms by late December that alerted the China CDC. CDC chief Gao Fu immediately sent a team to investigate.

At first, research appeared to be moving swiftly.

Overnight on January 1, the market suddenly was ordered shut, barring vendors from fetching their belongings, Jiang said. China CDC researchers collected 585 environmental samples from door handles, sewage and the floor of the market, and authorities sprayed the complex down with sanitiser. Later, they would cart out everything inside and incinerate it.

Internal China CDC data obtained by the AP shows that by January 10 and 11, researchers were sequencing dozens of environmental samples from Wuhan. Gary Kobinger, a Canadian microbiologist advising WHO, emailed his colleagues to share his concerns that the virus originated at the market.

'This corona(virus) is very close to SARS,' he wrote on January 13. 'If we put aside an accident...then I would look at the bats in these markets (sold and 'wild').'

By late January, Chinese state media announced that 33 of the environmental samples had tested positive. In a report to WHO, officials said 11 specimens were more than 99% similar to the new coronavirus. They also told the U.N. health agency that rats and mice were common in the market, and that most of the positive samples were clustered in an area where vendors traded in wildlife.

In the meantime, Jiang avoided telling people he worked at Huanan because of the stigma. He criticised the political tussle between China and the U.S.

'It's pointless to blame anyone for this disease,' Jiang said.

As the virus continued spreading rapidly into February, Chinese scientists published a burst of research papers on Covid-19. Then a paper by two Chinese scientists proposed without concrete evidence that the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan laboratory near the market. It was later taken down, but it raised the need for image control.

Internal documents show that the state soon began requiring all coronavirus studies in China to be approved by high-level government officials - a policy that critics say paralysed research efforts.

A notice from a China CDC lab on February 24 put in new approval processes for publication under 'important instructions' from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Other notices ordered CDC staff not to share any data, specimens or other information related to the coronavirus with outside institutions or individuals.

Then on March 2, Xi emphasised 'coordination' on coronavirus research, state media reported.

The next day, China's cabinet, the State Council, centralised all Covid-19 publication under a special task force. The notice, obtained by the AP and marked 'not to be made public,' was far more sweeping in scope than the earlier CDC notices, applying to all universities, companies and medical and research institutions.

The order said communication and publication of research had to be orchestrated like 'a game of chess' under instructions from Xi, and propaganda and public opinion teams were to 'guide publication.' It went on to warn that those who publish without permission, 'causing serious adverse social impact, shall be held accountable.'

'The regulations are very strict, and they don't make any sense,' said a former China CDC deputy director, who declined to be named because they were told not to speak to the media. 'I think it's political, because people overseas could find things being said there that might contradict what China says, so it's all being controlled.'

After the secret orders, the tide of research papers slowed to a trickle. Although China CDC researcher Liu Jun returned to the market nearly 20 times to collect some 2,000 samples over the following months, nothing was released about what they revealed.

On May 25, CDC chief Gao finally broke the silence around the market in an interview with China's Phoenix TV. He said that, unlike the environmental samples, no animal samples from the market had tested positive.

The announcement surprised scientists who didn't even know Chinese officials had taken samples from animals. It also ruled out the market as the likely source of the virus, along with further research that showed many of the first cases had no ties to it.

With the market proving a dead end, scientists turned more attention to hunting for the virus at its likely source: Bats.

Nearly a thousand miles away from the wet market in Wuhan, bats inhabit the maze of underground limestone caves in Yunnan province. With its rich, loamy soil, fog banks and dense plant growth, this area in southern China bordering Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar is one of the most biologically diverse on earth.

At one Yunnan cave visited by the AP, with thick roots hanging over the entrance, bats fluttered out at dusk and flew over the roofs of a nearby small village. White droppings splattered the ground near an altar in the rear of the cave, and Buddhist prayer strings of red and yellow twine hung from the stalactites. Villagers said the cave had been used as a sacred place presided over by a Buddhist monk from Thailand.

Contact like this between bats and people praying, hunting or mining in caves alarms scientists. The coronavirus' genetic code is strikingly similar to that of bat coronaviruses, and most scientists suspect Covid-19 jumped into humans either directly from a bat or via an intermediary animal.

Since bats harbouring coronaviruses are found in China and throughout Southeast Asia, the wild animal host of Covid-19 could be anywhere in the region, said Linfa Wang at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

'There is a bat somewhere with a 99.9% similar virus to the coronavirus,' Wang said. 'Bats don't respect these borders.

Covid-19 research is proceeding in countries such as Thailand, where Dr. Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, a coronavirus expert, is leading teams of scientists deep into the countryside to collect samples from bats. During one expedition in August, Supaporn told the AP the virus could be found 'anywhere' there were bats.

Chinese scientists quickly started testing potential animal hosts. Records show that Xia Xueshan, an infectious diseases expert, received a 1.4 million RMB ($214,000) grant to screen animals in Yunnan for Covid-19. State media reported in February that his team collected hundreds of samples from bats, snakes, bamboo rats and other animals, and ran a picture of masked scientists in white lab coats huddled around a large, caged porcupine.

Then the government restrictions kicked in. Data on the samples still has not been made public, and Xia did not respond to requests for an interview. Although Xia has co-authored more than a dozen papers this year, an AP review shows, only two were on Covid-19, and neither focused on its origins.

Today, the caves that scientists once surveyed are under close watch by the authorities. Security agents tailed the AP team in three locations across Yunnan, and stopped journalists from visiting the cave where researchers in 2017 identified the species of bats responsible for SARS. At an entrance to a second location, a massive cave teeming with tourists taking selfies, authorities shut the gate on the AP.

'We just got a call from the county,' said a park official, before an armed policeman showed up.

Scientists are keen to study occasions where humans may have had contact with bats as this could help to explain how the coronavirus moved from animals into people.

Particularly sensitive is the mine shaft where the closest relative of the Covid-19 virus - called 'RaTG13' - was found.

RaTG13 was discovered after an outbreak in 2012, when six men cleaning the bat-filled shaft fell ill with mysterious bouts of pneumonia, killing three. The Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China CDC both studied bat coronaviruses from this shaft. And although most scientists believe the Covid-19 virus had its origins in nature, some say it or a close relative could have been transported to Wuhan and leaked by mistake.

Wuhan Institute of Virology bat expert Shi Zhengli has repeatedly denied this theory, but Chinese authorities haven't yet allowed foreign scientists in to investigate.

Some state-backed scientists say research is proceeding as usual. Famed virologist Zhang, who received a 1.5 million RMB ($230,000) grant to search for the virus' origins, said partnering scientists are sending him samples from all over, including from bats in Guizhou in southern China and rats in Henan hundreds of miles north.

'Bats, mice, are there any new coronaviruses in them? Do they have this particular coronavirus?' Zhang said. 'We've been doing this work for over a decade. It's not like we just started today.'

Zhang declined to confirm or comment on reports that his lab was briefly closed after publishing the virus' genetic sequence ahead of authorities. He said he hasn't heard of any special restrictions on publishing papers, and the only review his papers go through is a routine scientific one by his institution.

But scientists without state backing complain that getting approval to sample animals in southern China is now extremely difficult, and that little is known about the findings of government-sponsored teams.

Even as they controlled research within China, Chinese authorities promoted theories that suggested the virus came from elsewhere.

The government gave Bi Yuhai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences scientist tapped to spearhead origins research, a 1.5 million RMB grant ($230,000), records show. A paper co-authored by Bi suggested an outbreak in a Beijing market in June could have been caused by packages of contaminated frozen fish from Europe.

China's government-controlled media used the theory to suggest the original outbreak in Wuhan could have started with seafood imported from abroad - a notion international scientists reject. WHO has said it is very unlikely that people can be infected with Covid-19 via packaged food, and that it is 'highly speculative' to suggest Covid-19 did not start in China. Bi did not respond to requests for an interview, and China has not provided enough virus samples for a definitive analysis.

The Chinese state press also has widely covered initial studies from Europe suggesting Covid-19 was found in wastewater samples in Italy and Spain last year. But scientists have largely dismissed these studies, and the researchers themselves acknowledged they did not find enough virus fragments to determine conclusively if it was the coronavirus.

And in the last few weeks, Chinese state media has taken out of context research from a German scientist, interpreting it to suggest that the pandemic began in Italy. The scientist, Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research, has said repeatedly that he believes the virus first emerged in China.

As well as clamping down on some research, the Chinese government is actively promoting fringe theories regarding the origin of the virus, the AP investigation found. Pictured: People eat in a restaurant outside of Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on November 30, 2020

China has promoted research that appears to suggest the virus may have started outside of China, despite stronger evidence to the contrary. Pictured: A worker wearing a mask peeps out behind construction barrier with a notice depicting a bat and advocating for people not to eat wild animals at the airport in Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on December 3, 2020

Internal documents show the Chinese government also has sponsored studies on the possible role of the Southeast Asian pangolin, a scaly anteater once prized in traditional Chinese medicine, as an intermediary animal host. Within the span of three days in February, Chinese scientists put out four separate papers on coronaviruses related to Covid-19 in trafficked Malayan pangolins from Southeast Asia seized by customs officials in Guangdong.

But many experts now say the theory is unlikely. Wang of the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore said the search for the coronavirus in pangolins did not appear to be 'scientifically driven.' He said blood samples would be the most conclusive evidence of Covid-19's presence in the rare mammals, and so far, no incriminating matches have been found.

WHO has said more than 500 species of other animals, including cats, ferrets and hamsters, are being studied as possible intermediary hosts for Covid-19.

The Chinese government is also limiting and controlling the search for patient zero through the re-testing of old flu samples.

Chinese hospitals collect thousands of samples from patients with flu-like symptoms every week and store them in freezers. They could easily be tested again for Covid-19, although politics could then determine whether the results are made public, said Ray Yip, the founding director of the U.S. CDC office in China.

'They'd be crazy not to do it,' Yip said. 'The political leadership will wait for that information to see, does this information make China look stupid or not?...If it makes China look stupid, they won't.'

The Chinese government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and with the military, The AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping , according to internal documents obtained by the AP. Pictured: In this Tuesday, March 10, 2020 file photo, people walk by a giant TV screen at a quiet shopping mall in Beijing broadcasting news of Chinese President Xi Jinping talking to medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province, as he visited the center of the global virus outbreak [File photo]

In the U.S., CDC officials long ago tested roughly 11,000 early samples collected under the flu surveillance program since January 1. And in Italy, researchers recently found a boy who had fallen ill in November 2019 and later tested positive for the coronavirus.

But in China, scientists have only published retrospective testing data from two Wuhan flu surveillance hospitals - out of at least 18 in Hubei province alone and well over 500 across the country. The data includes just 520 samples out of the 330,000 collected in China last year.

These enormous gaps in the research aren't due just to a lack of testing but also to a lack of transparency. Internal data obtained by the AP shows that by Febuary 6, the Hubei CDC had tested over 100 samples in Huanggang, a city southeast of Wuhan. But the results have not been made public.

The little information that has dribbled out suggests the virus was circulating well outside Wuhan in 2019 - a finding that could raise awkward questions for Chinese officials about their early handling of the outbreak. Chinese researchers found that a child hundreds of miles from Wuhan had fallen ill with the virus by January 2, suggesting it was spreading widely in December. But earlier samples weren't tested, according to a scientist with direct knowledge of the study.

'There was a very deliberate choice of the time period to study, because going too early could have been too sensitive,' said the scientist, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A WHO report written in July but published in November said Chinese authorities had identified 124 cases in December 2019, including five cases outside Wuhan. Among WHO's aims for its upcoming visit to China are reviews of hospital records before December.

Coronavirus expert Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said identifying the pandemic's source should not be used to assign guilt.

'We're all part of this together,' he said.

The area is of intense scientific interest because it may hold clues to the origins of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1.7million people worldwide. Yet for scientists and journalists, it has become a black hole of no information because of political sensitivity and secrecy.

A bat research team visiting recently managed to take samples but had them confiscated, two people familiar with the matter said. Specialists in coronaviruses have been ordered not to speak to the press. And a team of Associated Press journalists was tailed by plainclothes police in multiple cars who blocked access to roads and sites in late November.

More than a year since the first known person was infected with the coronavirus, an AP investigation shows the Chinese government is strictly controlling all research into its origins, clamping down on some while actively promoting fringe theories that it could have come from outside China.

The government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and affiliated with the military, the AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping, according to internal documents obtained by The AP.

A rare leak from within the government, the dozens of pages of unpublished documents confirm what many have long suspected: The clampdown comes from the top.

As a result, very little has been made public. Authorities are severely limiting information and impeding cooperation with international scientists.

'What did they find?' asked Gregory Gray, a Duke University epidemiologist who oversees a lab in China studying the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to people. 'Maybe their data were not conclusive, or maybe they suppressed the data for some political reason. I don't know...I wish I did.'

Then the government restrictions kicked in. Data on the samples still has not been made public, and Xia did not respond to requests for an interview. Although Xia has co-authored more than a dozen papers this year, an AP review shows, only two were on Covid-19, and neither focused on its origins.

Today, the caves that scientists once surveyed are under close watch by the authorities. Security agents tailed the AP team in three locations across Yunnan, and stopped journalists from visiting the cave where researchers in 2017 identified the species of bats responsible for SARS. At an entrance to a second location, a massive cave teeming with tourists taking selfies, authorities shut the gate on the AP.

'We just got a call from the county,' said a park official, before an armed policeman showed up.

Scientists are keen to study occasions where humans may have had contact with bats as this could help to explain how the coronavirus moved from animals into people.

Particularly sensitive is the mine shaft where the closest relative of the Covid-19 virus - called 'RaTG13' - was found.

RaTG13 was discovered after an outbreak in 2012, when six men cleaning the bat-filled shaft fell ill with mysterious bouts of pneumonia, killing three. The Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China CDC both studied bat coronaviruses from this shaft. And although most scientists believe the Covid-19 virus had its origins in nature, some say it or a close relative could have been transported to Wuhan and leaked by mistake.

Wuhan Institute of Virology bat expert Shi Zhengli has repeatedly denied this theory, but Chinese authorities haven't yet allowed foreign scientists in to investigate.

Some state-backed scientists say research is proceeding as usual. Famed virologist Zhang, who received a 1.5 million RMB ($230,000) grant to search for the virus' origins, said partnering scientists are sending him samples from all over, including from bats in Guizhou in southern China and rats in Henan hundreds of miles north.

'Bats, mice, are there any new coronaviruses in them? Do they have this particular coronavirus?' Zhang said. 'We've been doing this work for over a decade. It's not like we just started today.'

Zhang declined to confirm or comment on reports that his lab was briefly closed after publishing the virus' genetic sequence ahead of authorities. He said he hasn't heard of any special restrictions on publishing papers, and the only review his papers go through is a routine scientific one by his institution.

But scientists without state backing complain that getting approval to sample animals in southern China is now extremely difficult, and that little is known about the findings of government-sponsored teams.

Even as they controlled research within China, Chinese authorities promoted theories that suggested the virus came from elsewhere.

The government gave Bi Yuhai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences scientist tapped to spearhead origins research, a 1.5 million RMB grant ($230,000), records show. A paper co-authored by Bi suggested an outbreak in a Beijing market in June could have been caused by packages of contaminated frozen fish from Europe.

China's government-controlled media used the theory to suggest the original outbreak in Wuhan could have started with seafood imported from abroad - a notion international scientists reject. WHO has said it is very unlikely that people can be infected with Covid-19 via packaged food, and that it is 'highly speculative' to suggest Covid-19 did not start in China. Bi did not respond to requests for an interview, and China has not provided enough virus samples for a definitive analysis.

The Chinese state press also has widely covered initial studies from Europe suggesting Covid-19 was found in wastewater samples in Italy and Spain last year. But scientists have largely dismissed these studies, and the researchers themselves acknowledged they did not find enough virus fragments to determine conclusively if it was the coronavirus.

And in the last few weeks, Chinese state media has taken out of context research from a German scientist, interpreting it to suggest that the pandemic began in Italy. The scientist, Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research, has said repeatedly that he believes the virus first emerged in China.

As well as clamping down on some research, the Chinese government is actively promoting fringe theories regarding the origin of the virus, the AP investigation found. Pictured: People eat in a restaurant outside of Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on November 30, 2020

China has promoted research that appears to suggest the virus may have started outside of China, despite stronger evidence to the contrary. Pictured: A worker wearing a mask peeps out behind construction barrier with a notice depicting a bat and advocating for people not to eat wild animals at the airport in Kunming in southern China's Yunnan province on December 3, 2020

Internal documents show the Chinese government also has sponsored studies on the possible role of the Southeast Asian pangolin, a scaly anteater once prized in traditional Chinese medicine, as an intermediary animal host. Within the span of three days in February, Chinese scientists put out four separate papers on coronaviruses related to Covid-19 in trafficked Malayan pangolins from Southeast Asia seized by customs officials in Guangdong.

But many experts now say the theory is unlikely. Wang of the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore said the search for the coronavirus in pangolins did not appear to be 'scientifically driven.' He said blood samples would be the most conclusive evidence of Covid-19's presence in the rare mammals, and so far, no incriminating matches have been found.

WHO has said more than 500 species of other animals, including cats, ferrets and hamsters, are being studied as possible intermediary hosts for Covid-19.

The Chinese government is also limiting and controlling the search for patient zero through the re-testing of old flu samples.

Chinese hospitals collect thousands of samples from patients with flu-like symptoms every week and store them in freezers. They could easily be tested again for Covid-19, although politics could then determine whether the results are made public, said Ray Yip, the founding director of the U.S. CDC office in China.

'They'd be crazy not to do it,' Yip said. 'The political leadership will wait for that information to see, does this information make China look stupid or not?...If it makes China look stupid, they won't.'

The Chinese government is handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to scientists researching the virus' origins in southern China and with the military, The AP has found. But it is monitoring their findings and mandating that the publication of any data or research must be approved by a new task force managed by China's cabinet, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping , according to internal documents obtained by the AP. Pictured: In this Tuesday, March 10, 2020 file photo, people walk by a giant TV screen at a quiet shopping mall in Beijing broadcasting news of Chinese President Xi Jinping talking to medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province, as he visited the center of the global virus outbreak [File photo]

In the U.S., CDC officials long ago tested roughly 11,000 early samples collected under the flu surveillance program since January 1. And in Italy, researchers recently found a boy who had fallen ill in November 2019 and later tested positive for the coronavirus.

But in China, scientists have only published retrospective testing data from two Wuhan flu surveillance hospitals - out of at least 18 in Hubei province alone and well over 500 across the country. The data includes just 520 samples out of the 330,000 collected in China last year.

These enormous gaps in the research aren't due just to a lack of testing but also to a lack of transparency. Internal data obtained by the AP shows that by Febuary 6, the Hubei CDC had tested over 100 samples in Huanggang, a city southeast of Wuhan. But the results have not been made public.

The little information that has dribbled out suggests the virus was circulating well outside Wuhan in 2019 - a finding that could raise awkward questions for Chinese officials about their early handling of the outbreak. Chinese researchers found that a child hundreds of miles from Wuhan had fallen ill with the virus by January 2, suggesting it was spreading widely in December. But earlier samples weren't tested, according to a scientist with direct knowledge of the study.

'There was a very deliberate choice of the time period to study, because going too early could have been too sensitive,' said the scientist, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A WHO report written in July but published in November said Chinese authorities had identified 124 cases in December 2019, including five cases outside Wuhan. Among WHO's aims for its upcoming visit to China are reviews of hospital records before December.

Coronavirus expert Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said identifying the pandemic's source should not be used to assign guilt.

2020-12-30 02:40:46+00:00,38,"A strain of the coronavirus very similar to the UK mutation was already circulating in Italy as early as August, a top virologist has said.

The 'Italian variant' was spreading weeks before the first known cases of the UK strain and could even have been a 'precursor' to the mutation in England, according to Arnaldo Caruso, the president of the Italian Society of Virology.

Scientists found the strain by analysing swab samples from a patient who had suffered an unusually persistent Covid-19 infection, Caruso told Adnkronos.

'To our surprise we realised that we had identified a new variant, similar but not identical to the English variant that was also starting to circulate in Italy,' he said.

The similarity 'between the variant we have identified and the English one leads us to think that the former may have actually generated the others that are emerging today in our continent,' he added.

India today became the latest country to announce the arrival of the UK strain, after six people who had recently returned from Britain tested positive, while Germany revealed that the new variant had already arrived by late November.

The UK coronavirus variant (in red) - feared to be more infectious than previous types - has already reached several European countries as well as long-haul destinations such as Canada, India and Australia, while Nigeria and South Africa have also reported new strains

The UK variant is feared to be more infectious and spread more easily among children, and is blamed for surging cases in London and the South East.

Fears over the new strain led Boris Johnson to cancel Christmas for millions and prompted dozens of countries to impose temporary travel bans on Britain.

But its exact origins remain unclear - with the variant believed to have 'emerged in September and then circulated at very low levels in the population until mid-November', according to the UK government.

The first specimen was taken on September 20, weeks after the similar mutation was apparently already spreading in Italy.

Studies by another Italian epidemiologist suggested that the variant found in Brescia 'could have been generated around early July,' Caruso said.

At least one of the mutations in the distinctive 'spike' proteins which the virus uses to attack the body is thought to be the first of its kind in Europe.

Caruso did not say whether the Italian variant was thought to be more transmissible, but suggested it could have been a forerunner of the UK's more infectious strain.

It echoes the finding that one of the most significant mutations in the UK variant is a change which was first observed in Brazil more than eight months ago.

As with the UK variant, there is no evidence that the Italian strain will make existing vaccines any less effective in protecting people from Covid-19.

'I remain optimistic at the moment,' Caruso said of the new strain.

Italy has seen a similar trend in cases to the UK, with a massive resurgence in the autumn which reached its peak in November, leading to tens of thousands more deaths

Italy's death rate has come down from its early-December peak although as in many countries the numbers may be deflated by the Christmas break

Italy is among the countries to have stopped travel from the UK and detected at least one case of the British strain in the last two weeks.

The patient and his partner had recently returned from the UK on a flight that landed at Rome's Fiumicino airport, and were put in isolation.

The new variant can be detected with PCR tests adapted to pick up mutations in the virus, which health experts say are unsurprising.

The finding in Italy comes as health authorities in Germany revealed they had found a case of the new variant as far back as November.

Samples taken from a man and woman in late November were sequenced by medical experts in Hannover and found to contain the mutated UK variant.

The elderly man, who has since died, is feared to have contracted the virus from a daughter who had visited England in mid-November.

Like the UK government, health officials in Germany said there was no sign that the new strain is more deadly, but it is thought to be up to 70 per cent more infectious.

Another similar strain has been found in South Africa and is also feared to spread more easily among young people, leading to a further series of travel bans.

Despite the travel restrictions, the UK variant has already appeared in a number of other countries including Canada and India.

The WHO has called on countries to step up their genomic sequencing efforts to ensure that any further mutations are detected in 2021.

'There will be setbacks and new challenges in the year ahead - for example new variants of Covid-19,' said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Tedros said that 'only if countries are looking and testing effectively will you be able to pick up variants and adjust strategies to cope'.

He said that the WHO is working closely with scientists across the world to 'better understand any and all changes to the virus' and their impact.

The UK is regarded as having a strong genome sequencing programme, hailed by Boris Johnson as 'the best in the world'.

The fact that variants may have been in Europe earlier than previously thought echoes the findings in several countries that the coronavirus was already spreading outside China in late 2019.

Italy has found evidence that the virus was spreading there as early as September last year, while other studies suggest it reached France, Brazil and the US in 2019.

It was not until December 31 that the WHO's China office was informed of a mystery pneumonia which had sickened 44 people in Wuhan.

Two months later, Italy became the centre of Europe's first major outbreak as the virus ran amok in the wealthy north, especially the region of Lombardy.

2020-12-29 17:59:48+00:00,22,"Spain will set up a registry of people who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and share the list with other EU states, health minister Salvador Illa said on Monday.

While vaccines will not be mandatory, Illa said a list would be drawn up of 'those people who have been offered it and have simply rejected it', after a government vaccination plan called for studying 'possible reasons for reluctance'.

Illa told La Sexta television that the registry would be shared with European countries 'as is done with other treatments', although employers or members of the public will not have access to it.

Like most of the EU, Spain began delivering the Pfizer/BioNTech jab at the weekend and hopes to vaccinate nearly half of its 47million population by early summer.

Spain has been hard hit by the pandemic with nearly 1.9million people infected. Cases have fallen from their autumn peak but were rising again before the Christmas lull

A survey published last month found that 28 per cent of Spaniards were unwilling to take a Covid-19 vaccine, down from 47 per cent in November.

The survey by the stat CIS research institute found 40.5 percent of respondents are willing to have the jab while 16.2 percent would do so if it is shown to be 'reliable'.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved by an EU regulator last week after trials showed it to be up to 95 per cent effective.

Illa said the registry would include anyone who turned down the vaccine 'for whatever reason, in a use of their legitimate freedom'.

'It is not a document which will be made public and it will be done with the utmost respect for data protection,' Illa said.

'The way to defeat the virus is to vaccinate all of us, or the more the better,' he added.

An official vaccine plan published on December 2 confirmed that the vaccine would be voluntary, but called for a registry of refusals to be kept.

'It is important to record cases of vaccination refusal in the Vaccination Registry, with the purpose of knowing the possible reasons for reluctance in different population groups,' the document said.

Araceli Rosario Hidalgo Sanchez, a 96-year-old woman living in a care home, took the country's historic first jab to begin the vaccination programme on Sunday.

Monica Tapias, a carer at the same retirement home in Guadalajara, followed her as the second Spaniard to receive the vaccine.

'Araceli and Monica represent a new step full of hope today,' Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said.

Under EU deals, Spain is in line to receive enough doses of the vaccine to immunise 80million people - almost twice the country's population.

People at elevated risk or very exposed to the virus, such as care home residents and medical staff, will be first in line.

Extra doses will go to 'nearby countries that might need them', the health ministry said earlier this month.

Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries in Europe during the pandemic, with Covid deaths passing the 50,000 mark on Monday.

2020-12-29 10:37:34+00:00,45,"A strain of the coronavirus very similar to the UK mutation was already circulating in Italy as early as August, a top virologist has said.

The 'Italian variant' was spreading weeks before the first known cases of the UK strain and could even have been a 'precursor' to the mutation in England, according to Arnaldo Caruso, the president of the Italian Society of Virology.

Scientists found the strain by analysing swab samples from a patient who had suffered an unusually persistent Covid-19 infection, Caruso told Adnkronos.

'To our surprise we realised that we had identified a new variant, similar but not identical to the English variant that was also starting to circulate in Italy,' he said.

The similarity 'between the variant we have identified and the English one leads us to think that the former may have actually generated the others that are emerging today in our continent,' he added.

India today became the latest country to announce the arrival of the UK strain, after six people who had recently returned from Britain tested positive, while Germany revealed that the new variant had already arrived by late November.

The UK coronavirus variant (in red) - feared to be more infectious than previous types - has already reached several European countries as well as long-haul destinations such as Canada, India and Australia, while Nigeria and South Africa have also reported new strains

The UK variant is feared to be more infectious and spread more easily among children, and is blamed for surging cases in London and the South East.

Fears over the new strain led Boris Johnson to cancel Christmas for millions and prompted dozens of countries to impose temporary travel bans on Britain.

But its exact origins remain unclear - with the variant believed to have 'emerged in September and then circulated at very low levels in the population until mid-November', according to the UK government.

The first specimen was taken on September 20, weeks after the similar mutation was apparently already spreading in Italy.

Studies by another Italian epidemiologist suggested that the variant found in Brescia 'could have been generated around early July,' Caruso said.

At least one of the mutations in the distinctive 'spike' proteins which the virus uses to attack the body is thought to be the first of its kind in Europe.

Caruso did not say whether the Italian variant was thought to be more transmissible, but suggested it could have been a forerunner of the UK's more infectious strain.

It echoes the finding that one of the most significant mutations in the UK variant is a change which was first observed in Brazil more than eight months ago.

As with the UK variant, there is no evidence that the Italian strain will make existing vaccines any less effective in protecting people from Covid-19.

'I remain optimistic at the moment,' Caruso said of the new strain.

Italy has seen a similar trend in cases to the UK, with a massive resurgence in the autumn which reached its peak in November, leading to tens of thousands more deaths

Italy's death rate has come down from its early-December peak although as in many countries the numbers may be deflated by the Christmas break

Italy is among the countries to have stopped travel from the UK and detected at least one case of the British strain in the last two weeks.

The patient and his partner had recently returned from the UK on a flight that landed at Rome's Fiumicino airport, and were put in isolation.

The new variant can be detected with PCR tests adapted to pick up mutations in the virus, which health experts say are unsurprising.

The finding in Italy comes as health authorities in Germany revealed they had found a case of the new variant as far back as November.

Samples taken from a man and woman in late November were sequenced by medical experts in Hannover and found to contain the mutated UK variant.

The elderly man, who has since died, is feared to have contracted the virus from a daughter who had visited England in mid-November.

Like the UK government, health officials in Germany said there was no sign that the new strain is more deadly, but it is thought to be up to 70 per cent more infectious.

Another similar strain has been found in South Africa and is also feared to spread more easily among young people, leading to a further series of travel bans.

Despite the travel restrictions, the UK variant has already appeared in a number of other countries including Canada and India.

A patient is vaccinated in Naples on Sunday as Italy begins its immunisation programme following the deadliest outbreak in Europe with 72,370 deaths since February

The WHO has called on countries to step up their genomic sequencing efforts to ensure that any further mutations are detected in 2021.

'There will be setbacks and new challenges in the year ahead - for example new variants of Covid-19,' said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Tedros said that 'only if countries are looking and testing effectively will you be able to pick up variants and adjust strategies to cope'.

He said that the WHO is working closely with scientists across the world to 'better understand any and all changes to the virus' and their impact.

The UK is regarded as having a strong genome sequencing programme, hailed by Boris Johnson as 'the best in the world'.

The fact that variants may have been in Europe earlier than previously thought echoes the findings in several countries that the coronavirus was already spreading outside China in late 2019.

Italy has found evidence that the virus was spreading there as early as September last year, while other studies suggest it reached France, Brazil and the US in 2019.

It was not until December 31 that the WHO's China office was informed of a mystery pneumonia which had sickened 44 people in Wuhan.

Two months later, Italy became the centre of Europe's first major outbreak as the virus ran amok in the wealthy north, especially the region of Lombardy.

As of Monday evening, more than 2.05million people had been infected in Italy, with 72,370 deaths confirmed.",MailOnline,"['countries', 'uk', 'strain', 'thought', 'travel', 'english', 'variant', 'finds', 'similar', 'italian', 'virus', 'covid19', 'italy']",0
2020-12-29 08:32:50+00:00,33,"Spain will set up a registry of people who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and share the list with other EU states, health minister Salvador Illa said on Monday.

While vaccines will not be mandatory, Illa said a list would be drawn up of 'those people who have been offered it and have simply rejected it', after a government vaccination plan called for studying 'possible reasons for reluctance'.

Illa told La Sexta television that the registry would be shared with European countries 'as is done with other treatments', although employers or members of the public will not have access to it.

Like most of the EU, Spain began delivering the Pfizer/BioNTech jab at the weekend and hopes to vaccinate nearly half of its 47million population by early summer.

A 72-year-old man is given his first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at a nursing home in Madrid on Sunday as Spain begins its Covid-19 vaccination programme

Spain has been hard hit by the pandemic with nearly 1.9million people infected. Cases have fallen from their autumn peak but were rising again before the Christmas lull

A survey published last month found that 28 per cent of Spaniards were unwilling to take a Covid-19 vaccine, down from 47 per cent in November.

The survey by the stat CIS research institute found 40.5 percent of respondents are willing to have the jab while 16.2 percent would do so if it is shown to be 'reliable'.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved by an EU regulator last week after trials showed it to be up to 95 per cent effective.

Illa said the registry would include anyone who turned down the vaccine 'for whatever reason, in a use of their legitimate freedom'.

'It is not a document which will be made public and it will be done with the utmost respect for data protection,' Illa said.

'The way to defeat the virus is to vaccinate all of us, or the more the better,' he added.

An official vaccine plan published on December 2 confirmed that the vaccine would be voluntary, but called for a registry of refusals to be kept.

'It is important to record cases of vaccination refusal in the Vaccination Registry, with the purpose of knowing the possible reasons for reluctance in different population groups,' the document said.

Spain aims to vaccinate up to 20million people by June, with an initial target of 2.5million by the end of February.

Araceli Rosario Hidalgo Sanchez, a 96-year-old woman living in a care home, took the country's historic first jab to begin the vaccination programme on Sunday.

Monica Tapias, a carer at the same retirement home in Guadalajara, followed her as the second Spaniard to receive the vaccine.

'Araceli and Monica represent a new step full of hope today,' Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said.

Under EU deals, Spain is in line to receive enough doses of the vaccine to immunise 80million people - almost twice the country's population.

People at elevated risk or very exposed to the virus, such as care home residents and medical staff, will be first in line.

Extra doses will go to 'nearby countries that might need them', the health ministry said earlier this month.

Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries in Europe during the pandemic, with Covid deaths passing the 50,000 mark on Monday.

Countries including France, Austria, Portugal and Spain are also due to begin mass vaccinations, starting with health workers, on Sunday.

The new mutant, called 501.V2, was announced in Cape Town last Friday and is believed to be a more extreme variant than Britain's new Covid strain which has plunged millions into miserable Christmas lockdowns.

Cases in South Africa have soared from fewer than 3,000 a day at the start of December to more than 9,500 per day, with the mutant accounting for up to 90 percent of those new infections.

More than 8,500 have been hospitalised - surpassing the country's first wave peak of 8,300 inpatients.

Matt Hancock said: 'This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible, and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant has been discovered in the UK.'

Travel operators started flying out to South Africa from London at the beginning of October.

Virgin Atlantic began running four weekly flights between London and Johannesburg on October 18, while two flights have arrived from Cape Town since Monday.

The company flies Boeing 787-9 aircraft to South Africa carrying 290 people on each trip - meaning more than 11,000 people could traveled under normal conditions - however, the Covid-19 pandemic has severely reduced the number of passengers taking trips.

British Airways has been running seven weekly journeys to Johannesburg and Cape Town since October 1.

It means more than 100 BA and Virgin Atlantic flights have traveled between the two countries since flights resumed.

Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, Israel and Mauritius have banned flights from South Africa in an effort to stop the spread of the mutant which is thought to be giving young people more acute symptoms than other variants.

'British & Irish Nationals, visa holders and permanent residents arriving from South Africa will be able to enter but are required to self-isolate for ten days along with their household.

'Visitors from South Africa will not be permitted to enter, to stop the spread of COVID-19.'

Britain has already imposed sweeping Tier 4 lockdown measures to curb the spread of a mutated strain of the virus which is up to 70% more transmissible, and further studies are ongoing.

South African doctors say their patients are younger and do not always have other conditions that amplify the virus' effect, but are nonetheless suffering from more severe forms of Covid-19.

South African Health minister Zweli Mkhize said the new strain appeared to spread faster, but that it was too early to tell its severity and whether current vaccines would work against it.

'The evidence that has been collated, therefore, strongly suggests that the current second wave we are experiencing is being driven by this new variant,' Mkhize added.

The mutant strain was first noticed amid rising Covid-19 cases, which the country had not predicted to see until its winter began in April next year.

Professor Tulio de Oliveira told CBS News that rising cases had been spotted along the South African coast.

Prof de Oliveira warned: 'Maybe the virus is beginning to outsmart us.'

Mr Shapps concluded: 'Visitors from South Africa will not be permitted to enter, to stop the spread of COVID-19

He added: 'We are quite concerned, not only for South Africa, but also for the rest of Africa.

'Our health system has been has been affected by 20 years of HIV and TB epidemics, so we are quite concerned that while Africa may have escaped the first wave quite successfully, if it doesn't become more strict and try to control this virus, we may not escape this this second wave as successfully as we did in the first one.'

The mutation means the country may see 'many more cases' in the new wave than it experienced in the first surge of the disease.

Young people have hit the headlines in South Africa for fuelling the spread of the new strain with raves and parents have been criticised for not keeping their children under stricter control.

Super-spreader events including football tournaments, weddings, street parties and pub sessions have been widely reported on social media.

Mutations in viruses are to be expected - more than 4,000 different strains of coronavirus have already been tracked - but genomics experts look out for critical changes to the spike proteins which can alter how people suffer from the disease.

'In the UK they have also identified a new variant... there are quite a few similarities between the two lineages... there are also a similar number of mutations,' said Professor Tulio de Oliviera, a member of Cape Town's genomics consortium.

The two cases of the South African variant discovered in Britain were found in London and the North West.

The fact that they were detected through random routine sampling which picks out only around one in 10 tests carried out - and that they are thought to have been infected by separate travellers - suggests there are many more cases of the variant already in Britain.

Britain has been leading the world in tracking changes to the virus so it is likely that many more such mutants are already widespread.

The British mutant has already appeared in samples taken by scientists in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia.

But in the case of the British variant, scientists have expressed confidence that the mutation will not impact the efficacy of the vaccine.

This is because when the body produced antibodies to a virus it does so for large chunks of its genetic data, meaning that a more significant mutation would be required to defeat the vaccine.

Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: 'This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible, and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant has been discovered in the UK.'

'We are working with them with our SARS-CoV-2 Virus evolution working group,' said WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, using the full name for the virus.

'They are growing the virus in the country and they're working with researchers to determine any changes in the behaviour of the virus itself in terms of transmission.'

Like Britain, South Africa has found itself isolated by a series of travel bans following the discovery of the new strain.

Aviation experts said they expected more airlines and countries to follow suit, at least until more was known.

South Africa’s tourism department said it had no information on numbers of flights cancelled or rescheduled due to the bans, but that it was working with the foreign ministry and foreign embassies to facilitate contact between foreign citizens in South Africa and their governments.

South Africa has been affected more by the coronavirus than other countries on the continent, and as of Tuesday had seen 940,212 cases and 25,246 deaths.

After a July peak in which cases were regularly rising by more than 10,000 per day, the numbers had fallen as low as 1,500 per day by mid-November.

But they have since come surging back again, and deaths have also risen from a typical 93 per day a month ago to 226 per day now.

The 339 new deaths added to the tally on Tuesday marked the highest single-day jump since the end of the first wave.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has said there will be no hard lockdown this time but there are early closures for pubs and bars and curtailed hours for alcohol sales.

Ramaphosa has also ordered the closing of popular beaches during the festive season, which falls in the Southern Hemisphere summer.

Why have we slapped a travel ban on South Africa and what further action can authorities take? Everything you need to know about the latest mutant strain

What has happened?

Within a week of learning about one new mutant strain of coronavirus, the UK now has another.

The variant was found in two people, one in London and another in the North West, who came into contact with separate people returning from South Africa.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday it was 'highly concerning' and the variant was 'yet more transmissible' than the original strain the UK has been battling.

Where has the new strain come from?

The new variant emerged after the first wave of coronavirus at Nelson Mandela Bay, in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province, and rapidly became the dominant strain in the area.

South Africa has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections in Africa, with around 900,000 cases and more than 20,000 related deaths.

The strain was picked up in this country using genomic sequencing.

What has been done to tackle it?

Both of the people in the UK who have the new strain of the virus have been quarantined, along with their close contacts.

Rapid investigation of the variant will now take place at Public Health England's research laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire.

What further action can the authorities take?

It is understood the law could change to bring in a travel ban for most people flying from South Africa.

Meanwhile travellers returning from South Africa – and their contacts – will be required to go into self-isolation for ten days.

What does it mean for the fight against the virus?

One mutation in the new strain, called N501Y, is thought to help the virus become more infect- ious – and spread more easily between people.

That means measures such as social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding unnecessary contacts have become more important.

What about the vaccine?

Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, told the Downing Street press conference there is no evidence the new strain may stop coronavirus vaccines from working.

The interior ministry invited people who 'actively contributed' to the fight against coronavirus to apply for fast-track naturalisation in September.

Some 3,000 workers applied, of whom 74 have now been granted a French passport with another 693 in the final stages of becoming citizens, junior minister for citizenship Marlene Schiappa said yesterday.

The move comes as France announced a draft law that would ban anti-vaxxers from using public transport.

France will reward hundreds of migrants frontline workers exposing them to high Covid-19 risks with citizenship. Pictured: French people wait in a queue for their turn to take coronavirus antigenic swab testing at a test centre set up outside a pharmacy in Paris yesterday

In a statement, Ms Schiappa said: 'Foreign workers gave their time and swung into action for all of us during the Covid crisis.

'It is now up to the Republic to take a step toward them.

'Health professionals, cleaning ladies, childcare workers, checkout staff: They all proved their commitment to the nation, and it is now the turn of the republic to take a step towards them.'

Immigration authorities have also been ordered to reduce the residency period needed for citizenship to two years from the usual five in the case of 'great services rendered'.

The move is a notable deviation from France's toughening of immigration rules in recent years.

People who fail to get a Covid-19 vaccination could be banned from using public transport in France. Pictured: A testing facility in Le Bignon yesterday

Last year, some 112,000 foreigners acquired French nationality, including more than 48,000 by naturalisation - 10 percent fewer than in 2018.

Tunisian-born physiotherapist Aziz Youssef, who migrated to France in 2014, said his fast-tracked application took two years off when he had expected to gain French citizenship.

Mr Youssef said that he had visited dozens of isolated patients during the first wave of the pandemic.

He told the New York Times: 'Everything sped up very quickly.'

Mr Youssef added that he viewed acceleration as 'a form of recognition for the work that was done.'

France recorded 11,861 confirmed cases of coronavirus yesterday, with 802 dying from the disease.

Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday got his cabinet's backing for a bill that is designed to provide a legal framework for dealing with health crises, including the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the text, which will now be submitted to parliament, a negative Covid test or proof of a 'preventative treatment, including the administration of a vaccine' could be required for people to be granted 'access to transport or to some locations, as well as certain activities'.

According to opinion polls, 55 percent of French people say they will not get a Covid shot, one of the highest rates in the European Union.

The government's vaccination campaign is to start on Sunday.

Freezers are pictured in a warehouse which will be used as a logistic hub for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in Chanteloup-en-Brie. The government's vaccination campaign is to start on Sunday

President Emmanuel Macron has promised that coronavirus vaccinations, though strongly recommended, will not be mandatory.

But opposition politicians condemned the draft law, with Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right RN party, calling it an 'essentially totalitarian' measure.

'In a backhanded way, this bill does not aim to make vaccinations mandatory, but will prevent anybody who doesn't comply from having a social life,' she said.

RN party spokesman Sebastien Chenu said Macron's government was planning 'a health dictatorship'.

Guillaume Peltier, deputy leader of the centre-right LR party, said it was 'inconceivable' that the government should be allowed to 'get all the power to suspend our freedoms without parliamentary control.'

In response, public sector minister Amelie de Montchalin said the bill was 'not at all made to create exceptional powers for the government' or 'create a health state.'

2020-12-23 23:05:15+00:00,38,"Wearing a cloth mask may not shield the user from coronavirus because too many infected droplets can slip through, a study has claimed.

Scientists at New Mexico State University, in the US, studied five types of face coverings including cloth masks and surgical grade N95 masks.

They found that while all masks blocked at least 95 per cent of droplets from coughs and sneezes - there was still a risk of the disease being passed on.

Although cloth masks stopped 96.4 per cent of sneeze droplets at a distance of six feet, they still let more than 1,000 through - which the scientists said could carry enough virus particles to trigger an infection.

'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person,' said Dr Krishna Kota, an associate professor at the university who led the research.

The science behind mask-wearing was hazy at the start of the pandemic and authorities in the UK and other countries hesitated to recommend wearing them.

The World Health Organization did recommend masks until June 8, and then only for people over 60 and those with underlying health conditions.

In Britain, face coverings were first brought in for public transport in June, and later for shops and other indoor spaces in July. In the US regulations vary across the country, with some states setting up rules as early as April but others resisting making masks mandatory.

The general consensus now is that masks may offer only limited protection to the people wearing them, but they are quite good at stopping people spreading the disease if they have it without knowing, because they catch their breath.

Scientists have also suggested that masks could reduce severity of disease by exposing people to the virus in small doses, but this hasn't been proven.

Five types of face masks were examined with results showing that the N95 (top right) blocked the most at 100% of droplets and the regular cloth mask (bottom left) blocked the least at 96.4% of droplets

'A mask definitely helps, but if the people are very close to each other, there is still a chance of spreading or contracting the virus,' said Dr Kota.

'It's not just masks that will help. It's both the masks and distancing.'

For the study, published in the journal Physics of Fluid, the team built a machine that mimics coughs and sneezes from humans.

It uses an air generator to blow tiny liquid droplets, like those that would escape from a nose or a mouth.

The machine was tested on five different types of masks: an N95 mask, s surgical mask, a cloth mask, a two-layer cloth mask and a wet two-layer cloth mask.

The researchers say wetting a mask could help because the material’s fibers will expand, reducing the pore size accessible for droplets to get through.

Two glass square tubes were joined with a mask tightly fit between them and a camera lens to capture the number of droplets.

Each of the masks were able to block most of the droplets with the best-performing being the N95, which blocked 100 percent of droplets.

Meanwhile, the worst was the regular cloth mask, which only blocked 96.4 percent of the droplets from getting through.

However, at distances of less than six feet, letting in around three percent of droplets could be enough to make someone ill.

Studies have shown that the average infection threshold for COVID-19 is 1,000 virus particles, inhaled either all at once or on separate occasions.

In addition, a single sneeze has the potential to carry up to 200 million virus particles.

The cloth mask let through more than 1,000 sneeze droplets, each of which could have millions of virus particles.

The two-layered cloth mask with a PM2.5 filter let through more than 600 sneeze droplets.

This means that if someone wearing one of these masks is close to an infected individual, enough droplets could escape to make them contract COVID-19.

'Without a face mask, it is almost certain that many foreign droplets will transfer to the susceptible person,' Kota said.

'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person by decreasing the number of foreign airborne sneeze and cough droplets that would otherwise enter the person without the mask.

'Consideration must be given to minimize or avoid close face-to-face or frontal human interactions, if possible.'",MailOnline,"['stop', 'blocked', 'mask', 'person', 'sneeze', 'social', 'cloth', 'spread', 'masks', 'n95', 'wearing', 'distancing', 'virus', 'covid19', 'droplets']",0

The mutation means the country may see 'many more cases' in the new wave than it experienced in the first surge of the disease.

Young people have hit the headlines in South Africa for fuelling the spread of the new strain with raves and parents have been criticised for not keeping their children under stricter control.

Super-spreader events including football tournaments, weddings, street parties and pub sessions have been widely reported on social media.

Mutations in viruses are to be expected - more than 4,000 different strains of coronavirus have already been tracked - but genomics experts look out for critical changes to the spike proteins which can alter how people suffer from the disease.

'In the UK they have also identified a new variant... there are quite a few similarities between the two lineages... there are also a similar number of mutations,' said Professor Tulio de Oliviera, a member of Cape Town's genomics consortium.

The two cases of the South African variant discovered in Britain were found in London and the North West.

The fact that they were detected through random routine sampling which picks out only around one in 10 tests carried out - and that they are thought to have been infected by separate travellers - suggests there are many more cases of the variant already in Britain.

Britain has been leading the world in tracking changes to the virus so it is likely that many more such mutants are already widespread.

The British mutant has already appeared in samples taken by scientists in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia.

But in the case of the British variant, scientists have expressed confidence that the mutation will not impact the efficacy of the vaccine.

This is because when the body produced antibodies to a virus it does so for large chunks of its genetic data, meaning that a more significant mutation would be required to defeat the vaccine.

Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: 'This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible, and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant has been discovered in the UK.'

'They are growing the virus in the country and they're working with researchers to determine any changes in the behaviour of the virus itself in terms of transmission.'

Like Britain, South Africa has found itself isolated by a series of travel bans following the discovery of the new strain.

South Africa has been affected more by the coronavirus than other countries on the continent, and as of Tuesday had seen 940,212 cases and 25,246 deaths.

After a July peak in which cases were regularly rising by more than 10,000 per day, the numbers had fallen as low as 1,500 per day by mid-November.

But they have since come surging back again, and deaths have also risen from a typical 93 per day a month ago to 226 per day now.

The 339 new deaths added to the tally on Tuesday marked the highest single-day jump since the end of the first wave.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has said there will be no hard lockdown this time but there are early closures for pubs and bars and curtailed hours for alcohol sales.

Ramaphosa has also ordered the closing of popular beaches during the festive season, which falls in the Southern Hemisphere summer.

Why have we slapped a travel ban on South Africa and what further action can authorities take? Everything you need to know about the latest mutant strain

What has happened?

Within a week of learning about one new mutant strain of coronavirus, the UK now has another.

The variant was found in two people, one in London and another in the North West, who came into contact with separate people returning from South Africa.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday it was 'highly concerning' and the variant was 'yet more transmissible' than the original strain the UK has been battling.

Where has the new strain come from?

The new variant emerged after the first wave of coronavirus at Nelson Mandela Bay, in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province, and rapidly became the dominant strain in the area.

South Africa has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections in Africa, with around 900,000 cases and more than 20,000 related deaths.

The strain was picked up in this country using genomic sequencing.

What has been done to tackle it?

Both of the people in the UK who have the new strain of the virus have been quarantined, along with their close contacts.

Rapid investigation of the variant will now take place at Public Health England's research laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire.

What further action can the authorities take?

It is understood the law could change to bring in a travel ban for most people flying from South Africa.

Meanwhile travellers returning from South Africa – and their contacts – will be required to go into self-isolation for ten days.

What does it mean for the fight against the virus?

One mutation in the new strain, called N501Y, is thought to help the virus become more infect- ious – and spread more easily between people.

That means measures such as social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding unnecessary contacts have become more important.

What about the vaccine?

Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, told the Downing Street press conference there is no evidence the new strain may stop coronavirus vaccines from working.

The interior ministry invited people who 'actively contributed' to the fight against coronavirus to apply for fast-track naturalisation in September.

Some 3,000 workers applied, of whom 74 have now been granted a French passport with another 693 in the final stages of becoming citizens, junior minister for citizenship Marlene Schiappa said yesterday.

The move comes as France announced a draft law that would ban anti-vaxxers from using public transport.

'It is now up to the Republic to take a step toward them.

'Health professionals, cleaning ladies, childcare workers, checkout staff: They all proved their commitment to the nation, and it is now the turn of the republic to take a step towards them.'

Immigration authorities have also been ordered to reduce the residency period needed for citizenship to two years from the usual five in the case of 'great services rendered'.

The move is a notable deviation from France's toughening of immigration rules in recent years.

Last year, some 112,000 foreigners acquired French nationality, including more than 48,000 by naturalisation - 10 percent fewer than in 2018.

Tunisian-born physiotherapist Aziz Youssef, who migrated to France in 2014, said his fast-tracked application took two years off when he had expected to gain French citizenship.

Mr Youssef said that he had visited dozens of isolated patients during the first wave of the pandemic.

He told the New York Times: 'Everything sped up very quickly.'

Mr Youssef added that he viewed acceleration as 'a form of recognition for the work that was done.'

France recorded 11,861 confirmed cases of coronavirus yesterday, with 802 dying from the disease.

Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday got his cabinet's backing for a bill that is designed to provide a legal framework for dealing with health crises, including the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the text, which will now be submitted to parliament, a negative Covid test or proof of a 'preventative treatment, including the administration of a vaccine' could be required for people to be granted 'access to transport or to some locations, as well as certain activities'.

According to opinion polls, 55 percent of French people say they will not get a Covid shot, one of the highest rates in the European Union.

President Emmanuel Macron has promised that coronavirus vaccinations, though strongly recommended, will not be mandatory.

But opposition politicians condemned the draft law, with Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right RN party, calling it an 'essentially totalitarian' measure.

'In a backhanded way, this bill does not aim to make vaccinations mandatory, but will prevent anybody who doesn't comply from having a social life,' she said.

RN party spokesman Sebastien Chenu said Macron's government was planning 'a health dictatorship'.

Guillaume Peltier, deputy leader of the centre-right LR party, said it was 'inconceivable' that the government should be allowed to 'get all the power to suspend our freedoms without parliamentary control.'

2020-12-23 17:54:35+00:00,31,"Wearing a cloth mask may not shield the user from coronavirus because too many infected droplets can slip through, a study has claimed.

Scientists at New Mexico State University, in the US, studied five types of face coverings including cloth masks and surgical grade N95 masks.

They found that while all masks blocked at least 95 per cent of droplets from coughs and sneezes - there was still a risk of the disease being passed on.

Although cloth masks stopped 96.4 per cent of sneeze droplets at a distance of six feet, they still let more than 1,000 through - which the scientists said could carry enough virus particles to trigger an infection.

'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person,' said Dr Krishna Kota, an associate professor at the university who led the research.

The science behind mask-wearing was hazy at the start of the pandemic and authorities in the UK and other countries hesitated to recommend wearing them.

The World Health Organization did recommend masks until June 8, and then only for people over 60 and those with underlying health conditions.

In Britain, face coverings were first brought in for public transport in June, and later for shops and other indoor spaces in July. In the US regulations vary across the country, with some states setting up rules as early as April but others resisting making masks mandatory.

The general consensus now is that masks may offer only limited protection to the people wearing them, but they are quite good at stopping people spreading the disease if they have it without knowing, because they catch their breath.

Scientists have also suggested that masks could reduce severity of disease by exposing people to the virus in small doses, but this hasn't been proven.

Five types of face masks were examined with results showing that the N95 (top right) blocked the most at 100% of droplets and the regular cloth mask (bottom left) blocked the least at 96.4% of droplets

'A mask definitely helps, but if the people are very close to each other, there is still a chance of spreading or contracting the virus,' said Dr Kota.

'It's not just masks that will help. It's both the masks and distancing.'

For the study, published in the journal Physics of Fluid, the team built a machine that mimics coughs and sneezes from humans.

It uses an air generator to blow tiny liquid droplets, like those that would escape from a nose or a mouth.

The machine was tested on five different types of masks: an N95 mask, s surgical mask, a cloth mask, a two-layer cloth mask and a wet two-layer cloth mask.

The researchers say wetting a mask could help because the material’s fibers will expand, reducing the pore size accessible for droplets to get through.

Two glass square tubes were joined with a mask tightly fit between them and a camera lens to capture the number of droplets.

Each of the masks were able to block most of the droplets with the best-performing being the N95, which blocked 100 percent of droplets.

Meanwhile, the worst was the regular cloth mask, which only blocked 96.4 percent of the droplets from getting through.

However, at distances of less than six feet, letting in around three percent of droplets could be enough to make someone ill.

Studies have shown that the average infection threshold for COVID-19 is 1,000 virus particles, inhaled either all at once or on separate occasions.

In addition, a single sneeze has the potential to carry up to 200 million virus particles.

The cloth mask let through more than 1,000 sneeze droplets, each of which could have millions of virus particles.

The two-layered cloth mask with a PM2.5 filter let through more than 600 sneeze droplets.

This means that if someone wearing one of these masks is close to an infected individual, enough droplets could escape to make them contract COVID-19.

'Without a face mask, it is almost certain that many foreign droplets will transfer to the susceptible person,' Kota said.

'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person by decreasing the number of foreign airborne sneeze and cough droplets that would otherwise enter the person without the mask.

'Consideration must be given to minimize or avoid close face-to-face or frontal human interactions, if possible.'",MailOnline,"['stop', 'blocked', 'mask', 'person', 'sneeze', 'social', 'cloth', 'spread', 'masks', 'n95', 'wearing', 'distancing', 'virus', 'covid19', 'droplets']",0

2020-12-23 16:00:28+00:00,14,"Britain tonight banned all arrivals from South Africa, as well as travel to the nation, after discovering two cases of a mutant Covid-19 strain which is driving a massive second wave among young people in the country.

The new mutant, called 501.V2, was announced in Cape Town last Friday and is believed to be a more extreme variant than Britain's new Covid strain which has plunged millions into miserable Christmas lockdowns.

Cases in South Africa have soared from fewer than 3,000 a day at the start of December to more than 9,500 per day, with the mutant accounting for up to 90 percent of those new infections.

More than 8,500 have been hospitalised - surpassing the country's first wave peak of 8,300 inpatients.

Matt Hancock said: 'This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible, and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant has been discovered in the UK.'

What further action can the authorities take?

It is understood the law could change to bring in a travel ban for most people flying from South Africa.

Meanwhile travellers returning from South Africa – and their contacts – will be required to go into self-isolation for ten days.

What does it mean for the fight against the virus?

One mutation in the new strain, called N501Y, is thought to help the virus become more infect- ious – and spread more easily between people.

That means measures such as social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding unnecessary contacts have become more important.

What about the vaccine?

Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, told the Downing Street press conference there is no evidence the new strain may stop coronavirus vaccines from working.

2020-12-23 15:30:07+00:00,21,"Wearing a cloth mask may not shield the user from coronavirus because too many infected droplets can slip through, a study has claimed.

Scientists at New Mexico State University, in the US, studied five types of face coverings including cloth masks and surgical grade N95 masks.

They found that while all masks blocked at least 95 per cent of droplets from coughs and sneezes - there was still a risk of the disease being passed on.

Although cloth masks stopped 96.4 per cent of sneeze droplets at a distance of six feet, they still let more than 1,000 through - which the scientists said could carry enough virus particles to trigger an infection.

'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person,' said Dr Krishna Kota, an associate professor at the university who led the research.

The science behind mask-wearing was hazy at the start of the pandemic and authorities in the UK and other countries hesitated to recommend wearing them.

The World Health Organization did recommend masks until June 8, and then only for people over 60 and those with underlying health conditions.

In Britain, face coverings were first brought in for public transport in June, and later for shops and other indoor spaces in July. In the US regulations vary across the country, with some states setting up rules as early as April but others resisting making masks mandatory.

The general consensus now is that masks may offer only limited protection to the people wearing them, but they are quite good at stopping people spreading the disease if they have it without knowing, because they catch their breath.

Scientists have also suggested that masks could reduce severity of disease by exposing people to the virus in small doses, but this hasn't been proven.

Five types of face masks were examined with results showing that the N95 (top right) blocked the most at 100% of droplets and the regular cloth mask (bottom left) blocked the least at 96.4% of droplets

'A mask definitely helps, but if the people are very close to each other, there is still a chance of spreading or contracting the virus,' said Dr Kota.

'It's not just masks that will help. It's both the masks and distancing.'

For the study, published in the journal Physics of Fluid, the team built a machine that mimics coughs and sneezes from humans.

It uses an air generator to blow tiny liquid droplets, like those that would escape from a nose or a mouth.

The machine was tested on five different types of masks: an N95 mask, s surgical mask, a cloth mask, a two-layer cloth mask and a wet two-layer cloth mask.

The researchers say wetting a mask could help because the material’s fibers will expand, reducing the pore size accessible for droplets to get through.

Two glass square tubes were joined with a mask tightly fit between them and a camera lens to capture the number of droplets.

Each of the masks were able to block most of the droplets with the best-performing being the N95, which blocked 100 percent of droplets.

Meanwhile, the worst was the regular cloth mask, which only blocked 96.4 percent of the droplets from getting through.

However, at distances of less than six feet, letting in around three percent of droplets could be enough to make someone ill.

Studies have shown that the average infection threshold for COVID-19 is 1,000 virus particles, inhaled either all at once or on separate occasions.

In addition, a single sneeze has the potential to carry up to 200 million virus particles.

The cloth mask let through more than 1,000 sneeze droplets, each of which could have millions of virus particles.

The two-layered cloth mask with a PM2.5 filter let through more than 600 sneeze droplets.

This means that if someone wearing one of these masks is close to an infected individual, enough droplets could escape to make them contract COVID-19.

'Without a face mask, it is almost certain that many foreign droplets will transfer to the susceptible person,' Kota said.

'Wearing a mask will offer substantial, but not complete, protection to a susceptible person by decreasing the number of foreign airborne sneeze and cough droplets that would otherwise enter the person without the mask.

2020-12-23 15:05:39+00:00,7,"France will reward hundreds of migrant frontline workers in the fight against Covid-19 by granting them citizenship.

The interior ministry invited people who 'actively contributed' to the fight against coronavirus to apply for fast-track naturalisation in September.

Some 3,000 workers applied, of whom 74 have now been granted a French passport with another 693 in the final stages of becoming citizens, junior minister for citizenship Marlene Schiappa said yesterday.

The move comes as France announced a draft law that would ban anti-vaxxers from using public transport.

France will reward hundreds of migrants frontline workers exposing them to high Covid-19 risks with citizenship. Pictured: French people wait in a queue for their turn to take coronavirus antigenic swab testing at a test centre set up outside a pharmacy in Paris yesterday

In a statement, Ms Schiappa said: 'Foreign workers gave their time and swung into action for all of us during the Covid crisis.

'It is now up to the Republic to take a step toward them.

'Health professionals, cleaning ladies, childcare workers, checkout staff: They all proved their commitment to the nation, and it is now the turn of the republic to take a step towards them.'

Immigration authorities have also been ordered to reduce the residency period needed for citizenship to two years from the usual five in the case of 'great services rendered'.

The move is a notable deviation from France's toughening of immigration rules in recent years.

People who fail to get a Covid-19 vaccination could be banned from using public transport in France. Pictured: A testing facility in Le Bignon yesterday

Last year, some 112,000 foreigners acquired French nationality, including more than 48,000 by naturalisation - 10 percent fewer than in 2018.

Tunisian-born physiotherapist Aziz Youssef, who migrated to France in 2014, said his fast-tracked application took two years off when he had expected to gain French citizenship.

Mr Youssef said that he had visited dozens of isolated patients during the first wave of the pandemic.

He told the New York Times: 'Everything sped up very quickly.'

Mr Youssef added that he viewed acceleration as 'a form of recognition for the work that was done.'

France recorded 11,861 confirmed cases of coronavirus yesterday, with 802 dying from the disease.

Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday got his cabinet's backing for a bill that is designed to provide a legal framework for dealing with health crises, including the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the text, which will now be submitted to parliament, a negative Covid test or proof of a 'preventative treatment, including the administration of a vaccine' could be required for people to be granted 'access to transport or to some locations, as well as certain activities'.

According to opinion polls, 55 percent of French people say they will not get a Covid shot, one of the highest rates in the European Union.

The government's vaccination campaign is to start on Sunday.

Freezers are pictured in a warehouse which will be used as a logistic hub for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in Chanteloup-en-Brie. The government's vaccination campaign is to start on Sunday

President Emmanuel Macron has promised that coronavirus vaccinations, though strongly recommended, will not be mandatory.

But opposition politicians condemned the draft law, with Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right RN party, calling it an 'essentially totalitarian' measure.

'In a backhanded way, this bill does not aim to make vaccinations mandatory, but will prevent anybody who doesn't comply from having a social life,' she said.

RN party spokesman Sebastien Chenu said Macron's government was planning 'a health dictatorship'.

Guillaume Peltier, deputy leader of the centre-right LR party, said it was 'inconceivable' that the government should be allowed to 'get all the power to suspend our freedoms without parliamentary control.'

But opposition politicians condemned the draft law, with Marine Le Pen, (pictured) leader of the far-right RN party, calling it an 'essentially totalitarian' measure

Centrist senator Nathalie Goulet said the draft was 'an attack on public freedoms', while the far-left deputy Alexis Corbiere said 'we could a least have a collective discussion if the idea is to limit our public liberties.'

In response, public sector minister Amelie de Montchalin said the bill was 'not at all made to create exceptional powers for the government' or 'create a health state.'

She said there would be a debate about the bill during which 'everything that needs clarification will be clarified.'

Authorities are now testing more than 100 contacts of the friend, a woman in her 30s, the health minister said on Tuesday.

Taiwan cracked down on the pandemic with rapid testing, quarantine measures, contact tracing and mask-wearing, which has seen infection rates remain low.

But despite closing its borders to tourists and insisting all arrivals test negative for the virus, imported cases have been on the rise in recent weeks - particularly among those coming from infection hotspots.

The New Zealand pilot tested positive in Taiwan on Sunday after flying a route to the US, before the woman tested positive on Tuesday.

Chen said the New Zealand national had not correctly reported all his contacts and list of places he had been, and may be in breach of Taiwan's communicable diseases law.

Under Article 62 of the law, anyone who knows they have been infected with certain communicable diseases and infects others by not complying with instructions can be issued with fines of NT $500,000 (£13,266.32) and face up to three years in prison.

The government has published a list of places he went in and around Taipei and told people who may have been there to monitor their health.

It is testing 167 people who have had direct contact with the new locally transmitted case.

Taiwan tech firm Quanta Storage Inc said the woman was an employee at a subsidiary, and that contacts who had been tested so far had come back negative for the virus.

Taiwan has reported a total of 771 cases - mostly imported - and seven deaths - since the pandemic began in March.

Around 130 people remain in hospital for treatment.

Separately, Taiwan is among dozens of territories and countries restricting travel to the United Kingdom after a highly infectious new coronavirus strain was found in the country.

2020-12-23 05:00:05+00:00,22,"Coronavirus antibodies made by llamas could be administered to Covid-19 patients in the form of nasal sprays or asthma-style inhalers to help combat the disease.

Studies have shown that llama nanobodies, made by the animals' immune systems, are far more effective than their human equivalents at preventing illness and infection from Covid-19.

Lab experiments have showed that the nanobodies adhere to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, effectively neutralising it.

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland have now isolated these nanobodies from an individual llama named Cormac, in order to test their 'therapeutic, preventative, and diagnostic potential' in the fight against Covid-19.

Early indicators reveal the nanobodies are effective in aerosol form, and can be administered to humans via nasal sprays or asthma-style inhalers.

The nanobodies were isolated from an individual named Cormac by researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland and early indicators reveal it also works in aerosol form, potentially leading to nasal sprays or inhalers (stock image, not Cormac)

Pictured, a diagram showing how scientists turned tiny antibodies from a llama, called nanobodies, into potential Covid-19 treatment in a lab

Senior author Professor David Brody said: 'We hope these anti-Covid-19 nanobodies may be highly effective and versatile in combating the coronavirus pandemic.'

Nanobodies are naturally produced by the immune systems of camelids - animals that include camels, llamas and alpacas.

On average, the proteins are about a tenth the weight of most human antibodies and are also cheaper and easier to engineer.

Teams across the world, including Britain, have been harvesting llama nanobodies that may help put the brakes on the pandemic.

Professor Brody and lead author Thomas 'T.J' Esparza say the one they have discovered – known as NIH-CoVnb-112 – is ten times stronger than any found to date.

Pictured, a diagram showing how the nanobodies bind to the virus's spike and prevent it from latching on to the ACE2 receptor which allows the virus to infect human cells

WHAT ARE NANOBODIES? Human antibodies, like those of most mammals, including humans, have two chains (heavy and light). However, camelids, such as llamas, also create a much smaller form with only a single heavy chain. This variant is much smaller in size and is known as a nanobody. Nanobodies are still antibodies, but are smaller, more stable and easily produced. They can be manipulated easily in a lab and can serve as alternatives to conventional antibodies for diagnostics and imaging. Antibodies are produced by the immune system and are made from 'memory'. When a virus infects a person which has previously caused illness, the immune system rapidly churns out the protective antibodies to neutralise the infection. They can only be created if the body is exposed to the virus by getting infected for real, or through a vaccine or other type of specialist immune therapy. They can work in a variety of ways, wither by targeting the virus itself or the location on a human cell to which it binds and infiltrates. An antibody test, which involves analysis of someone's blood sample, has two purposes: to reveal whether an individual has been infected in the past and may therefore be protected against the virus, and to count those people. Knowing you are immune to a virus - although whether people actually develop immunity to Covid-19 is still unknown - can affect how you act in the future. Someone may need to protect themselves less if they know they have been infected, for example, or medical staff may be able to return to work in the knowledge they are not at risk. Advertisement

It was identified after Cormac was injected five times over 28 days with a harmless 'pseudovirus' developed in a lab, featuring the same characteristic 'spike protein' as SARS-CoV-2.

'The spike protein acts like a key,' Mr Esparza explains.

'It does this by opening the door to infections when it binds to a protein called the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor, found on the surface of some cells.'

Injecting the pseudovirus kickstarts the llama's immune system, so it naturally creates nanobodies.

These nanobodies then attempt to block infections by covering the teeth of the spike protein, preventing it from binding with the ACE2 receptor.

The researchers found that low levels of the NIH-CoVnb-112 nanobodies prevented the modified pseudovirus from infecting these cells in petri dishes.

And it was equally effective when it was sprayed through the kind of nebulizer, or inhaler, used to help treat asthma patients.

Professor Brody said: 'One of the exciting things about nanobodies is that, unlike most regular antibodies, they can be aerosolised and inhaled to coat the lungs and airways.'

The neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland have applied for a patent on the nanobody described in Scientific Reports.

Mr Esparza said: 'Although we have a lot more work ahead of us, these results represent a promising first step.

'With support from the NIH we are quickly moving forward to test whether these nanobodies could be safe and effective preventative treatments for Covid-19.

'Collaborators are also working to find out whether they could be used for inexpensive and accurate testing.'

Antibodies are part of what is known as the adaptive immune system. They are molecules that essentially morph in response to an invading virus or bacteria.

Professor Brody said: 'For years TJ and I had been testing out how to use nanobodies to improve brain imaging.

'When the pandemic broke, we thought this was a once in a lifetime, all-hands-on-deck situation and joined the fight.'

Similar work is being carried out at the University of Reading where a herd of llamas are kept.

The 84-year-old, known for his love of getting close to the faithful, has rarely been seen wearing a mask since the virus first shook Italy in February.

Italy, the first Western country hit by the virus, has seen 69,214 Covid-19 fatalities since its outbreak emerged in February, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world. It has also registered some 1.96 million cases to date.

In September, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino who heads the Vatican's missionary arm, tested positive and went into isolation but is believed to be in good heath now.

During the first wave of the pandemic last spring, more than a dozen Swiss Guard tested positive as well as a person who lived in the same guest house where the Pope resides.

Andrea Arcangeli, the head of the Vatican's health services, said earlier this month that the city-state will start vaccinated residents and staff members early in the new year.

The pontiff is considered particularly at risk of complications if he contracts coronavirus, both because of his age and his history of lung problems.

He almost died when he was 21 after developing pleurisy, and had part of one of his lungs removed, according to biographer Austen Ivereigh.

In September, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino who heads the Vatican's missionary arm, tested positive and went into isolation but is believed to be in good heath now.

During the first wave of the pandemic last spring, more than a dozen Swiss Guard tested positive as well as a person who lived in the same guest house where the Pope resides.

Andrea Arcangeli, the head of the Vatican's health services, said earlier this month that the city-state will start vaccinated residents and staff members early in the new year.

2020-12-23 01:36:01+00:00,19,"Coronavirus antibodies made by llamas could be administered to Covid-19 patients in the form of nasal sprays or asthma-style inhalers to help combat the disease.

Studies have shown that llama nanobodies, made by the animals' immune systems, are far more effective than their human equivalents at preventing illness and infection from Covid-19.

Lab experiments have showed that the nanobodies adhere to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, effectively neutralising it.

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland have now isolated these nanobodies from an individual llama named Cormac, in order to test their 'therapeutic, preventative, and diagnostic potential' in the fight against Covid-19.

Early indicators reveal the nanobodies are effective in aerosol form, and can be administered to humans via nasal sprays or asthma-style inhalers.

Senior author Professor David Brody said: 'We hope these anti-Covid-19 nanobodies may be highly effective and versatile in combating the coronavirus pandemic.'

Nanobodies are naturally produced by the immune systems of camelids - animals that include camels, llamas and alpacas.

On average, the proteins are about a tenth the weight of most human antibodies and are also cheaper and easier to engineer.

Teams across the world, including Britain, have been harvesting llama nanobodies that may help put the brakes on the pandemic.

Professor Brody and lead author Thomas 'T.J' Esparza say the one they have discovered – known as NIH-CoVnb-112 – is ten times stronger than any found to date.

Pictured, a diagram showing how the nanobodies bind to the virus's spike and prevent it from latching on to the ACE2 receptor which allows the virus to infect human cells

WHAT ARE NANOBODIES? Human antibodies, like those of most mammals, including humans, have two chains (heavy and light). However, camelids, such as llamas, also create a much smaller form with only a single heavy chain. This variant is much smaller in size and is known as a nanobody. Nanobodies are still antibodies, but are smaller, more stable and easily produced. They can be manipulated easily in a lab and can serve as alternatives to conventional antibodies for diagnostics and imaging. Antibodies are produced by the immune system and are made from 'memory'. When a virus infects a person which has previously caused illness, the immune system rapidly churns out the protective antibodies to neutralise the infection. They can only be created if the body is exposed to the virus by getting infected for real, or through a vaccine or other type of specialist immune therapy. They can work in a variety of ways, wither by targeting the virus itself or the location on a human cell to which it binds and infiltrates. An antibody test, which involves analysis of someone's blood sample, has two purposes: to reveal whether an individual has been infected in the past and may therefore be protected against the virus, and to count those people. Knowing you are immune to a virus - although whether people actually develop immunity to Covid-19 is still unknown - can affect how you act in the future. Someone may need to protect themselves less if they know they have been infected, for example, or medical staff may be able to return to work in the knowledge they are not at risk. Advertisement

It was identified after Cormac was injected five times over 28 days with a harmless 'pseudovirus' developed in a lab, featuring the same characteristic 'spike protein' as SARS-CoV-2.

'The spike protein acts like a key,' Mr Esparza explains.

'It does this by opening the door to infections when it binds to a protein called the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor, found on the surface of some cells.'

Injecting the pseudovirus kickstarts the llama's immune system, so it naturally creates nanobodies.

These nanobodies then attempt to block infections by covering the teeth of the spike protein, preventing it from binding with the ACE2 receptor.

The researchers found that low levels of the NIH-CoVnb-112 nanobodies prevented the modified pseudovirus from infecting these cells in petri dishes.

And it was equally effective when it was sprayed through the kind of nebulizer, or inhaler, used to help treat asthma patients.

Professor Brody said: 'One of the exciting things about nanobodies is that, unlike most regular antibodies, they can be aerosolised and inhaled to coat the lungs and airways.'

The neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland have applied for a patent on the nanobody described in Scientific Reports.

Mr Esparza said: 'Although we have a lot more work ahead of us, these results represent a promising first step.

'With support from the NIH we are quickly moving forward to test whether these nanobodies could be safe and effective preventative treatments for Covid-19.

'Collaborators are also working to find out whether they could be used for inexpensive and accurate testing.'

Antibodies are part of what is known as the adaptive immune system. They are molecules that essentially morph in response to an invading virus or bacteria.

Professor Brody said: 'For years TJ and I had been testing out how to use nanobodies to improve brain imaging.

'When the pandemic broke, we thought this was a once in a lifetime, all-hands-on-deck situation and joined the fight.'

Authorities are now testing more than 100 contacts of the friend, a woman in her 30s, the health minister said on Tuesday.

Taiwan cracked down on the pandemic with rapid testing, quarantine measures, contact tracing and mask-wearing, which has seen infection rates remain low.

But despite closing its borders to tourists and insisting all arrivals test negative for the virus, imported cases have been on the rise in recent weeks - particularly among those coming from infection hotspots.

The New Zealand pilot tested positive in Taiwan on Sunday after flying a route to the US, before the woman tested positive on Tuesday.

Taiwan has reported its first locally transmitted case of COVID-19 since April 12 - a friend of a New Zealand pilot who was confirmed to have been infected earlier this week. Authorities are now testing more than 100 contacts of the friend, a woman in her 30s, the health minister said on Tuesday [File photo]

Chen said the New Zealand national had not correctly reported all his contacts and list of places he had been, and may be in breach of Taiwan's communicable diseases law.

Under Article 62 of the law, anyone who knows they have been infected with certain communicable diseases and infects others by not complying with instructions can be issued with fines of NT $500,000 (£13,266.32) and face up to three years in prison.

The government has published a list of places he went in and around Taipei and told people who may have been there to monitor their health.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said the New Zealand pilot confirmed as infected earlier this week had not correctly reported all his contacts and list of places he had been, and may be in breach of Taiwan's communicable diseases law. Pictured: Chen during an interview with AFP news agency in May 2017

It is testing 167 people who have had direct contact with the new locally transmitted case.

Taiwan tech firm Quanta Storage Inc said the woman was an employee at a subsidiary, and that contacts who had been tested so far had come back negative for the virus.

Taiwan has reported a total of 771 cases - mostly imported - and seven deaths - since the pandemic began in March.

Around 130 people remain in hospital for treatment.

Separately, Taiwan is among dozens of territories and countries restricting travel to the United Kingdom after a highly infectious new coronavirus strain was found in the country.

The government said it would halve the number of flights to the United Kingdom, to just one a week.

An antibody test, which involves analysis of someone's blood sample, has two purposes: to reveal whether an individual has been infected in the past and may therefore be protected against the virus, and to count those people. Knowing you are immune to a virus - although whether people actually develop immunity to Covid-19 is still unknown - can affect how you act in the future. Someone may need to protect themselves less if they know they have been infected, for example, or medical staff may be able to return to work in the knowledge they are not at risk. Advertisement

It was identified after Cormac was injected five times over 28 days with a harmless 'pseudovirus' developed in a lab, featuring the same characteristic 'spike protein' as SARS-CoV-2.

'The spike protein acts like a key,' Mr Esparza explains.

'It does this by opening the door to infections when it binds to a protein called the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor, found on the surface of some cells.'

Injecting the pseudovirus kickstarts the llama's immune system, so it naturally creates nanobodies.

These nanobodies then attempt to block infections by covering the teeth of the spike protein, preventing it from binding with the ACE2 receptor.

The researchers found that low levels of the NIH-CoVnb-112 nanobodies prevented the modified pseudovirus from infecting these cells in petri dishes.

And it was equally effective when it was sprayed through the kind of nebulizer, or inhaler, used to help treat asthma patients.

Professor Brody said: 'One of the exciting things about nanobodies is that, unlike most regular antibodies, they can be aerosolised and inhaled to coat the lungs and airways.'

The neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland have applied for a patent on the nanobody described in Scientific Reports.

Mr Esparza said: 'Although we have a lot more work ahead of us, these results represent a promising first step.

'With support from the NIH we are quickly moving forward to test whether these nanobodies could be safe and effective preventative treatments for Covid-19.

'Collaborators are also working to find out whether they could be used for inexpensive and accurate testing.'

Antibodies are part of what is known as the adaptive immune system. They are molecules that essentially morph in response to an invading virus or bacteria.

Professor Brody said: 'For years TJ and I had been testing out how to use nanobodies to improve brain imaging.

'When the pandemic broke, we thought this was a once in a lifetime, all-hands-on-deck situation and joined the fight.'

Similar work is being carried out at the University of Reading where a herd of llamas are kept.

Looked after by expert handlers, they are used to provide nanobodies which can be used in clinical trials of potential drugs.",MailOnline,"['immune', 'treat', 'antibodies', 'asthmastyle', 'llamas', 'effective', 'protein', 'human', 'inhaler', 'nanobodies', 'virus', 'work', 'covid19', 'spike', 'llama', 'powerful', 'filled']",0

Authorities are now testing more than 100 contacts of the friend, a woman in her 30s, the health minister said on Tuesday.

Taiwan cracked down on the pandemic with rapid testing, quarantine measures, contact tracing and mask-wearing, which has seen infection rates remain low.

But despite closing its borders to tourists and insisting all arrivals test negative for the virus, imported cases have been on the rise in recent weeks - particularly among those coming from infection hotspots.

The New Zealand pilot tested positive in Taiwan on Sunday after flying a route to the US, before the woman tested positive on Tuesday.

Chen said the New Zealand national had not correctly reported all his contacts and list of places he had been, and may be in breach of Taiwan's communicable diseases law.

Under Article 62 of the law, anyone who knows they have been infected with certain communicable diseases and infects others by not complying with instructions can be issued with fines of NT $500,000 (£13,266.32) and face up to three years in prison.

The government has published a list of places he went in and around Taipei and told people who may have been there to monitor their health.

Taiwan tech firm Quanta Storage Inc said the woman was an employee at a subsidiary, and that contacts who had been tested so far had come back negative for the virus.

Taiwan has reported a total of 771 cases - mostly imported - and seven deaths - since the pandemic began in March.

Around 130 people remain in hospital for treatment.

Separately, Taiwan is among dozens of territories and countries restricting travel to the United Kingdom after a highly infectious new coronavirus strain was found in the country.

2020-12-22 14:55:07+00:00,14,"Two cardinals close to Pope Francis have tested positive for Covid-19, a day after the pontiff exchanged Christmas greetings with senior staff, a Vatican source said today.

Polish cardinal Konrad Krajewski, who manages the Pope's charities and has the title of the Vatican's almoner, 'tested positive for Covid-19', Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.

The 57-year-old, known as the Pope's 'Robin Hood' for his work with the poor and the homeless, had symptoms of pneumonia and is being treated at a hospital in Rome.

Officials are still seeking to identify his recent contacts, but he is known to meet with the Pope regularly.

Italian cardinal Giuseppe Bertello, 78, the governor of Vatican City, tested positive and is believed to be in self-isolation in his home in the Vatican, the source said.

Two cardinals close to Pope Francis have tested positive for Covid-19, a day after the pontiff exchanged Christmas greetings (pictured) with senior staff, a Vatican source said today.

Polish cardinal Konrad Krajewski 'tested positive for Covid-19', Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. Pictured: Cardinal Krajewski (centre) attends Pope Francis' mass with newly elected Cardinals at St. Peter's Basilica on November 29, 2020 in Vatican City, Vatican.

It was not immediately clear if either or both attended an event on Monday at which members of the Vatican's central administration, known as the Curia, exchanged Christmas greetings with the pope.

During the event, the Pope, who has faced controversy over his reluctance to wear a mask, appeared without one again. Despite this the pontiff was pictured holding a baby during the celebration.

The 84-year-old, known for his love of getting close to the faithful, has rarely been seen wearing a mask since the virus first shook Italy in February.

Italy, the first Western country hit by the virus, has seen 69,214 Covid-19 fatalities since its outbreak emerged in February, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world. It has also registered some 1.96 million cases to date.

In September, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino who heads the Vatican's missionary arm, tested positive and went into isolation but is believed to be in good heath now.

During the first wave of the pandemic last spring, more than a dozen Swiss Guard tested positive as well as a person who lived in the same guest house where the Pope resides.

Andrea Arcangeli, the head of the Vatican's health services, said earlier this month that the city-state will start vaccinated residents and staff members early in the new year.

The pontiff is considered particularly at risk of complications if he contracts coronavirus, both because of his age and his history of lung problems.

He almost died when he was 21 after developing pleurisy, and had part of one of his lungs removed, according to biographer Austen Ivereigh.

The 84-year-old Pope, known for his love of getting close to the faithful, has rarely been seen wearing a mask since the virus first shook Italy in February

In a recent book, 'Let Us Dream', the Pope described how the experience gave him an insight into how coronavirus victims felt.

It was 1957, and he was in his second year of training for the priesthood in Buenos Aires, when he got taken to hospital fighting for his life.

The second in line to the Danish throne took part in a special clip on the royal family's Instagram account, celebrating the fourth Sunday of Advent in the lead up to Christmas.

Prince Christian, 15, was captured alongside his siblings Isabella, 13, and twins Vincent and Josephine, 9, as they watched their father Crown Prince Frederik light the last candle on a wreath as one of the country's festive traditions.

Princess Mary, 48, her husband, 52, and their children were forced to self isolate in Frederik VIII's Palace in Copenhagen for two weeks after Prince Christian tested positive for coronavirus.

The palace confirmed Prince Christian contracted the virus following an outbreak at his secondary school.

Prince Christian appeared to be all smiles in the video, with his mother Princess Mary looking effortlessly stylish in a high-neck jumper and long line coat.

The video was posted to Instagram with the caption: 'The Crown Prince's family sends a Christmas greeting from their home in Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg.'

Prince Frederik also wished everyone a 'Happy Christmas' before the family were seen enjoying a cup of tea around the kitchen table.

An important tradition in Danish families is the celebration of the four Sundays before Christmas with the lighting of one of the four candles on the advent wreath.

'The Crown Prince and Crown Princess were informed yesterday, Sunday 6 December 2020, of a local outbreak of COVID-19 at Tranegårdskolen in Hellerup,' the palace said at the time.

'Prince Christian has subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. His Royal Highness is in isolation in Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg.

'Other than the Crown Prince family, Prince Christian has not been in contact with other members of the royal family very recently.'

Prince Christian isolated until December 14, while the rest of his family tested negative for coronavirus.

The Crown Prince couple went into isolation with their four children at Fredensborg Palace in Denmark when the COVID crisis began in March.

The family chose to return to their spring and autumn residence from southwestern Switzerland, where the children had been taking a 12-week course at the Lemania-Verbier International School.

2020-12-22 06:00:10+00:00,38,"A top Russian scientist with close links to Edinburgh University who was 'working on a Covid-19 vaccine' has been found dead in suspicious circumstances in St Petersburg.

Biologist Alexander 'Sasha' Kagansky, 45, best known for his work on fighting cancer, was reported to have fallen in his underwear from a 14th floor window of a high rise residential building.

He also had a stab wound on his body, according to Moskovsky Komsomolets (MK).

The death follows six Russians plunging to their deaths from hospital windows earlier this year.

Five of the victims were being treated for coronavirus whilst one victim was a doctor who had complained about PPE shortages. Another doctor fell from a hospital window, but he survived and remains in hospital with head injuries.

Biologist Alexander 'Sasha' Kagansky, 45, best known for his work on fighting cancer, was reported to have fallen in his underwear from a 14th floor window of a high rise residential building

The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a murder probe into the death of Dr Kaganksy and a 45-year-old male suspect has been detained.

The suspect, who is reportedly a friend of Dr Kaganksy, has claimed that the biologist was in a mentally unstable state before his death and injured himself with a knife, reports Bild.

He claimed that Dr Kaganksy jumped from the balcony when he tried to take the weapon from him.

Dr Kagansky - an assistant professor in Vladivostok - had been working in Edinburgh for 13 years until at least 2017.

He was lately Director of the Centre for Genomic and Regenerative Medicine at Russia's Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, where he continued research collaboration with the Scottish university.

MK reported that the academic had been 'developing a vaccine against coronavirus' and that he died 'under strange circumstances'.

Dr Kaganksy's death brings the number of coronavirus-linked window falls in Russia to eight, all but one of them fatal

The report gave no further details about which of a number of international Covid-19 vaccines he was supposed to have been working on.

He had gone to St Petersburg to visit the graves of his relatives, and had gone to see an old school friend named Igor Ivanov, said one account.

Police believe there was a 'scuffle' before Kagansky fell, according to a report.

His body was found by a woman resident under a block on Zamshin Street in Russia's second city in early afternoon yesterday (SAT). Law enforcement are investigating the circumstances of his death, say reports.

The committee said today a St Petersburg resident, aged 45, had been detained as a suspect, and a criminal case for murder had been opened following the discovery of the body 'with signs of a violent death'.

Between 2005 and 2012, Dr Kaganksy worked at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh, as a postdoctoral research associate then a senior research associate.

He had recently received a Russian grant to study new ways of diagnosing and treating malignant brain tumours.

He was an advocate of research into the uses of herbs and mushrooms as potentially offering solutions in treating cancers. Earlier he had studied and worked in the US.

In 1991 as the USSR collapsed he was the first Russian delegate to the European Youth Parliament. He was also a member of Young Academy of Scotland.

Dr Kaganksy's death brings the number of coronavirus-linked window falls in Russia to eight, all but one of them fatal.

Nadezhda Salkova, age 74, fell in June from a fourth floor window of Semashko Hospital in Moscow where she was undergoing treatment for coronavirus.

She had been alone in a hospital room where she had been undergoing treatment for nearly three weeks, and the circumstances of her 40ft fall are under investigation by police.

Family members of other victims have suggested coronavirus sufferers are experiencing suicidal thoughts from drugs used to treat them, causing them to try and kill themselves.

Relatives say Mrs Shcherbakova - a police forensic officer who fell sick at work - was not suicidal and suspect an antibiotic she was given is to blame

Ten days earlier, a 68-year-old man suffering from Covid-19 plunged to his death from a window in the intensive care ward of Veterans' Hospital in Yaroslavl.

It has also emerged that a man, 49, with confirmed coronavirus fell 60ft from the window of a Moscow perinatal hospital which was reassigned to treat pandemic victims.

The family of police lieutenant-colonel Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, who died after a 50ft fall on 30 May, believe that drugs used to treat her coronavirus may have altered her state of mind.

She and her widower Konstantin were both senior police forensic experts, and her distraught family have called for checks on the medicines and their mind-changing impact.

What is levofloxacin? Levofloxacin is an antibiotic that is used to treat infections of bones, joints, ears and airways. The drug has common side-effects that are often seen with antibiotics - including diarrhea, rashes, dizziness and heartburn. However, it can also interfere with the nervous system of patients and cause a range of rare but mind-altering effects. These include hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia and suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Patients with a history of mental illness are considered more likely to suffer from these effects. People with a history of seizures are also asked to inform their doctor, because the medication could also put them at risk of suffering more. Advertisement

Shcherbakova had told a family member she was horrified about earlier Covid-19 hospital fall cases - all involving medics - and could not understand why they were happening.

Then she plunged to her death in exactly the same way.

Her family - including widower Konstantin, 61, and their twin daughters, 19 - are now seeking urgent answers about her death, which they say may have been caused by antibiotic levofloxacin that she was given before her fall.

The forensic expert began feeling 'anxious that she could die' and in phone calls to her family 'her mood was going downhill'.

Yet a doctor told one of her daughters, who expressed concern at her mood swings, that she was not in danger.

'She is completely fine, are you mad?' said the medic.

On May 31, shortly before falling from the window, she had made herself a cup of tea and managed to eat, she told one of her daughters.

At 7.44pm she informed her family she was being put on a drip, a procedure which should have taken two hours. She was briefly online at 8.37pm.

At 11pm her husband and one daughter took a call from the hospital saying: 'You know, she jumped from the fifth floor….'

She died soon afterwards despite attempts to save her.

She was 'happily married', close to her daughters, and a respected forensic specialist consulted by experts from across Russia.

Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, fell 50ft to her death from a hospital window in Moscow on May 31 while being treated for coronavirus

The family have been told that she was being treated with antibiotic Levofloxacin.

The powerful antibiotic can be used to treat pneumonia, but in rare cases can interfere with the nervous system and cause serious psychological side effects.

These can include hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

It is not known if other hospital window victims were treated with this same drug.

Dr Yelena Nepomnyashchaya, 47, a mother of two from a medical family, sustained fatal injuries after falling 50ft from a window at her Krasnoyarsk hospital.

She fell soon after complaining of an 'acute shortage' of PPE and died on 1 May, the only one of the victims who was not known to be suffering from coronavirus.

Dr Natalya Lebedeva, 48, was hospitalised with Covid-19 when she plunged 60ft to her death on 24 April after she was 'unfairly blamed' for the spread of coronavirus at her clinic in Star City, near Moscow, the training centre for cosmonauts.

Dr Alexander Shulepov, 37, remains in hospital with head injuries after plunging from a second floor window sustaining skull fractures.

He was diagnosed with Covid-19 and had complained about PPE shortages and being made to work despite suffering from the virus.

His wife Maria Shulepova was banned from speaking to the media over the incident.

Lt Col Shcherbakova had been treated for coronavirus with antibiotic Levofloxacin, a drug which can trigger 'suicidal thoughts and attempts' as rare side effects, according to Russian sources.

Her family were told there were also traces of an unnamed antidepressant in her blood.

Close medical observation for two hours after taking this drug was recommended, her relatives were informed, but she had not been put under any supervision, say sources.

Nadezhda Salkova, age 74, fell in June from a fourth floor window of Semashko Hospital in Moscow where she was undergoing treatment for coronavirus.

She had been alone in a hospital room where she had been undergoing treatment for nearly three weeks, and the circumstances of her 40ft fall are under investigation by police.

Family members of other victims have suggested coronavirus sufferers are experiencing suicidal thoughts from drugs used to treat them, causing them to try and kill themselves.

Relatives say Mrs Shcherbakova - a police forensic officer who fell sick at work - was not suicidal and suspect an antibiotic she was given is to blame

Ten days earlier, a 68-year-old man suffering from Covid-19 plunged to his death from a window in the intensive care ward of Veterans' Hospital in Yaroslavl.

It has also emerged that a man, 49, with confirmed coronavirus fell 60ft from the window of a Moscow perinatal hospital which was reassigned to treat pandemic victims.

The family of police lieutenant-colonel Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, who died after a 50ft fall on 30 May, believe that drugs used to treat her coronavirus may have altered her state of mind.

She and her widower Konstantin were both senior police forensic experts, and her distraught family have called for checks on the medicines and their mind-changing impact.

What is levofloxacin? Levofloxacin is an antibiotic that is used to treat infections of bones, joints, ears and airways. The drug has common side-effects that are often seen with antibiotics - including diarrhea, rashes, dizziness and heartburn. However, it can also interfere with the nervous system of patients and cause a range of rare but mind-altering effects. These include hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia and suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Patients with a history of mental illness are considered more likely to suffer from these effects. People with a history of seizures are also asked to inform their doctor, because the medication could also put them at risk of suffering more. Advertisement

Shcherbakova had told a family member she was horrified about earlier Covid-19 hospital fall cases - all involving medics - and could not understand why they were happening.

Then she plunged to her death in exactly the same way.

Her family - including widower Konstantin, 61, and their twin daughters, 19 - are now seeking urgent answers about her death, which they say may have been caused by antibiotic levofloxacin that she was given before her fall.

The forensic expert began feeling 'anxious that she could die' and in phone calls to her family 'her mood was going downhill'.

Yet a doctor told one of her daughters, who expressed concern at her mood swings, that she was not in danger.

'She is completely fine, are you mad?' said the medic.

On May 31, shortly before falling from the window, she had made herself a cup of tea and managed to eat, she told one of her daughters.

At 7.44pm she informed her family she was being put on a drip, a procedure which should have taken two hours. She was briefly online at 8.37pm.

At 11pm her husband and one daughter took a call from the hospital saying: 'You know, she jumped from the fifth floor….'

She died soon afterwards despite attempts to save her.

She was 'happily married', close to her daughters, and a respected forensic specialist consulted by experts from across Russia.

Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, fell 50ft to her death from a hospital window in Moscow on May 31 while being treated for coronavirus

The family have been told that she was being treated with antibiotic Levofloxacin.

The powerful antibiotic can be used to treat pneumonia, but in rare cases can interfere with the nervous system and cause serious psychological side effects.

These can include hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

It is not known if other hospital window victims were treated with this same drug.

Dr Yelena Nepomnyashchaya, 47, a mother of two from a medical family, sustained fatal injuries after falling 50ft from a window at her Krasnoyarsk hospital.

She fell soon after complaining of an 'acute shortage' of PPE and died on 1 May, the only one of the victims who was not known to be suffering from coronavirus.

Dr Natalya Lebedeva, 48, was hospitalised with Covid-19 when she plunged 60ft to her death on 24 April after she was 'unfairly blamed' for the spread of coronavirus at her clinic in Star City, near Moscow, the training centre for cosmonauts.

An important tradition in Danish families is the celebration of the four Sundays before Christmas with the lighting of one of the four candles on the advent wreath.

'The Crown Prince and Crown Princess were informed yesterday, Sunday 6 December 2020, of a local outbreak of COVID-19 at Tranegårdskolen in Hellerup,' the palace said at the time.

'Prince Christian has subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. His Royal Highness is in isolation in Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg.

'Other than the Crown Prince family, Prince Christian has not been in contact with other members of the royal family very recently.'

Prince Christian isolated until December 14, while the rest of his family tested negative for coronavirus.

The Crown Prince couple went into isolation with their four children at Fredensborg Palace in Denmark when the COVID crisis began in March.

The family chose to return to their spring and autumn residence from southwestern Switzerland, where the children had been taking a 12-week course at the Lemania-Verbier International School.

2020-12-21 19:15:10+00:00,24,"A top Russian scientist with close links to Edinburgh University who was 'working on a Covid-19 vaccine' has been found dead in suspicious circumstances in St Petersburg.

Biologist Alexander 'Sasha' Kagansky, 45, best known for his work on fighting cancer, was reported to have fallen in his underwear from a 14th floor window of a high rise residential building.

He also had a stab wound on his body, according to Moskovsky Komsomolets (MK).

The death follows six Russians plunging to their deaths from hospital windows earlier this year.

Five of the victims were being treated for coronavirus whilst one victim was a doctor who had complained about PPE shortages. Another doctor fell from a hospital window, but he survived and remains in hospital with head injuries.

The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a murder probe into the death of Dr Kaganksy and a 45-year-old male suspect has been detained.

The suspect, who is reportedly a friend of Dr Kaganksy, has claimed that the biologist was in a mentally unstable state before his death and injured himself with a knife, reports Bild.

He claimed that Dr Kaganksy jumped from the balcony when he tried to take the weapon from him.

Dr Kagansky - an assistant professor in Vladivostok - had been working in Edinburgh for 13 years until at least 2017.

He was lately Director of the Centre for Genomic and Regenerative Medicine at Russia's Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, where he continued research collaboration with the Scottish university.

MK reported that the academic had been 'developing a vaccine against coronavirus' and that he died 'under strange circumstances'.

Dr Kaganksy's death brings the number of coronavirus-linked window falls in Russia to eight, all but one of them fatal

The report gave no further details about which of a number of international Covid-19 vaccines he was supposed to have been working on.

He had gone to St Petersburg to visit the graves of his relatives, and had gone to see an old school friend named Igor Ivanov, said one account.

Police believe there was a 'scuffle' before Kagansky fell, according to a report.

His body was found by a woman resident under a block on Zamshin Street in Russia's second city in early afternoon yesterday (SAT). Law enforcement are investigating the circumstances of his death, say reports.

The committee said today a St Petersburg resident, aged 45, had been detained as a suspect, and a criminal case for murder had been opened following the discovery of the body 'with signs of a violent death'.

He had recently received a Russian grant to study new ways of diagnosing and treating malignant brain tumours.

He was an advocate of research into the uses of herbs and mushrooms as potentially offering solutions in treating cancers. Earlier he had studied and worked in the US.

The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a murder probe into the death of Dr Kaganksy and a 45-year-old male suspect has been detained.

The suspect, who is reportedly a friend of Dr Kaganksy, has claimed that the biologist was in a mentally unstable state before his death and injured himself with a knife, reports Bild.

He claimed that Dr Kaganksy jumped from the balcony when he tried to take the weapon from him.

Dr Kagansky - an assistant professor in Vladivostok - had been working in Edinburgh for 13 years until at least 2017.

He was lately Director of the Centre for Genomic and Regenerative Medicine at Russia's Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, where he continued research collaboration with the Scottish university.

MK reported that the academic had been 'developing a vaccine against coronavirus' and that he died 'under strange circumstances'.

Dr Kaganksy's death brings the number of coronavirus-linked window falls in Russia to eight, all but one of them fatal

The report gave no further details about which of a number of international Covid-19 vaccines he was supposed to have been working on.

He had gone to St Petersburg to visit the graves of his relatives, and had gone to see an old school friend named Igor Ivanov, said one account.

Police believe there was a 'scuffle' before Kagansky fell, according to a report.

His body was found by a woman resident under a block on Zamshin Street in Russia's second city in early afternoon yesterday (SAT). Law enforcement are investigating the circumstances of his death, say reports.

The committee said today a St Petersburg resident, aged 45, had been detained as a suspect, and a criminal case for murder had been opened following the discovery of the body 'with signs of a violent death'.

Between 2005 and 2012, Dr Kaganksy worked at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh, as a postdoctoral research associate then a senior research associate.

He had recently received a Russian grant to study new ways of diagnosing and treating malignant brain tumours.

He was an advocate of research into the uses of herbs and mushrooms as potentially offering solutions in treating cancers. Earlier he had studied and worked in the US.

In 1991 as the USSR collapsed he was the first Russian delegate to the European Youth Parliament. He was also a member of Young Academy of Scotland.

Dr Kaganksy's death brings the number of coronavirus-linked window falls in Russia to eight, all but one of them fatal.

Nadezhda Salkova, age 74, fell in June from a fourth floor window of Semashko Hospital in Moscow where she was undergoing treatment for coronavirus.

She had been alone in a hospital room where she had been undergoing treatment for nearly three weeks, and the circumstances of her 40ft fall are under investigation by police.

Family members of other victims have suggested coronavirus sufferers are experiencing suicidal thoughts from drugs used to treat them, causing them to try and kill themselves.

Relatives say Mrs Shcherbakova - a police forensic officer who fell sick at work - was not suicidal and suspect an antibiotic she was given is to blame

Ten days earlier, a 68-year-old man suffering from Covid-19 plunged to his death from a window in the intensive care ward of Veterans' Hospital in Yaroslavl.

It has also emerged that a man, 49, with confirmed coronavirus fell 60ft from the window of a Moscow perinatal hospital which was reassigned to treat pandemic victims.

The family of police lieutenant-colonel Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, who died after a 50ft fall on 30 May, believe that drugs used to treat her coronavirus may have altered her state of mind.

She and her widower Konstantin were both senior police forensic experts, and her distraught family have called for checks on the medicines and their mind-changing impact.

Mrs Shcherbakova fell from the fifth floor of this hospital, crashing through mosquito netting before suffering fatal injuries as she hit the ground

Her death comes after two coronavirus medics - Yelena Nepomnyashchaya (left) and Natalya Lebedeva (right) - also fell to their deaths from hospital windows

What is levofloxacin? Levofloxacin is an antibiotic that is used to treat infections of bones, joints, ears and airways. The drug has common side-effects that are often seen with antibiotics - including diarrhea, rashes, dizziness and heartburn. However, it can also interfere with the nervous system of patients and cause a range of rare but mind-altering effects. These include hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia and suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Patients with a history of mental illness are considered more likely to suffer from these effects. People with a history of seizures are also asked to inform their doctor, because the medication could also put them at risk of suffering more. Advertisement

Shcherbakova had told a family member she was horrified about earlier Covid-19 hospital fall cases - all involving medics - and could not understand why they were happening.

Then she plunged to her death in exactly the same way.

Her family - including widower Konstantin, 61, and their twin daughters, 19 - are now seeking urgent answers about her death, which they say may have been caused by antibiotic levofloxacin that she was given before her fall.

The forensic expert began feeling 'anxious that she could die' and in phone calls to her family 'her mood was going downhill'.

Yet a doctor told one of her daughters, who expressed concern at her mood swings, that she was not in danger.

'She is completely fine, are you mad?' said the medic.

On May 31, shortly before falling from the window, she had made herself a cup of tea and managed to eat, she told one of her daughters.

At 7.44pm she informed her family she was being put on a drip, a procedure which should have taken two hours. She was briefly online at 8.37pm.

At 11pm her husband and one daughter took a call from the hospital saying: 'You know, she jumped from the fifth floor….'

She died soon afterwards despite attempts to save her.

She was 'happily married', close to her daughters, and a respected forensic specialist consulted by experts from across Russia.

Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, fell 50ft to her death from a hospital window in Moscow on May 31 while being treated for coronavirus

The family have been told that she was being treated with antibiotic Levofloxacin.

The powerful antibiotic can be used to treat pneumonia, but in rare cases can interfere with the nervous system and cause serious psychological side effects.

These can include hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

It is not known if other hospital window victims were treated with this same drug.

Dr Yelena Nepomnyashchaya, 47, a mother of two from a medical family, sustained fatal injuries after falling 50ft from a window at her Krasnoyarsk hospital.

She fell soon after complaining of an 'acute shortage' of PPE and died on 1 May, the only one of the victims who was not known to be suffering from coronavirus.

Dr Natalya Lebedeva, 48, was hospitalised with Covid-19 when she plunged 60ft to her death on 24 April after she was 'unfairly blamed' for the spread of coronavirus at her clinic in Star City, near Moscow, the training centre for cosmonauts.

Dr Alexander Shulepov, 37, remains in hospital with head injuries after plunging from a second floor window sustaining skull fractures.

He was diagnosed with Covid-19 and had complained about PPE shortages and being made to work despite suffering from the virus.

His wife Maria Shulepova was banned from speaking to the media over the incident.

Lt Col Shcherbakova had been treated for coronavirus with antibiotic Levofloxacin, a drug which can trigger 'suicidal thoughts and attempts' as rare side effects, according to Russian sources.

Her family were told there were also traces of an unnamed antidepressant in her blood.

Close medical observation for two hours after taking this drug was recommended, her relatives were informed, but she had not been put under any supervision, say sources.

'Today, I am one of you,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook page, attaching a screenshot of a text message with his test results.

'Now it seems it will be a different holiday.'

Macron is suffering a fever, a cough and fatigue and has a military doctor at his bedside in Versailles after catching coronavirus, it emerged today.

Macron, 42, is staying at a residence called La Lanterne after testing positive for Covid-19 in a result which sparked frantic contact-tracing among EU leaders.

While Macron is in a younger age group than most world leaders and is not known to have any medical problems, he had already developed symptoms by the time his diagnosis was announced on Thursday.

It comes as Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic today announced he has also tested positive for Covid-19, a week after he attended an EU summit in Brussels with Macron and 23 other EU leaders.

Health campaigners furious that Macron sat down with 10 senior colleagues for dinner By PETER ALLEN FOR MAILONLINE Criminal complaints that could result in prison sentences have been filed over a dinner organised by French President Emmanuel Macron before he went down with Coronavirus. Health campaigners are furious that the 42-year-old head of state sat down to a meal with up to 10 senior colleagues at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Wednesday evening. The next day, Mr Macron’s aides confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19, after displaying ‘mild symptoms’ caused by the virus. Not only was the dinner in the middle of an 8pm to 6am curfew in the French capital, but it broke government guidelines limiting the number sitting around a meal table to six. On Friday, two Paris-based pressure groups called ‘The Collective Victims of Coronavirus France’ and ‘The Hanged’ filed criminal complaints for ‘endangering the lives of others’. This is a criminal offence in France – one punishable by up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of €15,000 (£13,600). Maître Fabrice Di Vizio, the lawyer for the groups, said on Friday that the complaint had initially been filed against ‘X’, meaning it potentially targets anyone who helped organise the dinner, or who attended. Mr Macon will be excluded from any possible indictment, because as President of France he enjoys immunity from prosecution. Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, is also likely to enjoy legal privilege, according to those familiar with the complaint. But those who can potentially be taken to court include Richard Ferrand, the President of the National Assembly, the second chamber of France’s parliament. Christophe Castaner, the head of Mr Macron’s En Marche ! (On the Move) party in parliament and the former Interior Minister, is also a possible defendant. So too are En Marche ! MPs and key Macron policy advisors including Stanislas Guérini and Thierry Solère, all of whom were at the meal which went on until around 12.30am. Maître Di Vizio told Capital magazine that Élysée staff were threatened by the meal, ‘which did not fall within the framework of the exceptions provided for in the curfew: it was not urgent and could have been replaced by a videoconference.’ Paris prosecutors confirmed that the complaint had been filed, while the Élysée insisted that all health guidelines had been followed. ‘It was a working dinner, held in a large salon, with everyone involved abiding by social distancing guidelines,’ said a presidential source. Mr Macron had on Friday retired to La Lanterne, the official presidential residence in Versailles, west of Paris, to carry on working in isolation as he tried to get over his illness. Following his Coronavirus diagnosis, there were fears that the President may have infected others, after a frantic week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing. On Monday, Mr Macron was pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Élysée palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation. This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!' These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There’s no denying it.' Mr Macron’s wife, Brigitte Macron, is also self-isolating, but at the Élysée, and on not in Versailles. Advertisement

In the days before his positive test, he had rubbed shoulders with a long list of EU leaders in Paris and Brussels - with the leaders of Spain and Portugal among those now in isolation.

Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US president Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

He has also cancelled a planned December 22 trip to Lebanon, where he has been spearheading efforts at reform after the disastrous Beirut port explosion in August.

Last night, Macron appeared on screen at a conference on French foreign aid policy, wearing a mask but not looking visibly ill.

On Thursday, an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking hands with fellow politicians, saying: 'There's no denying it.'

Macron had embraced Portuguese premier Antonio Costa as recently as Wednesday, and shook hands with 70-year-old OECD chief Jose Angel Gurria on Monday.

A presidential official indicated that Macron was likely already infected by then because he had probably contracted the virus at last week's EU summit.

Macron mingled with fellow EU leaders in the summit room and was filmed giving fist-bumps to some of his counterparts.

Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic announced today he had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the summit.

'Today, I am one of you,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook page, attaching a screenshot of a text message with his test results.

German chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, tested negative for the virus after attending the summit along with all but two of the EU's 27 heads of government.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee said in a brief statement on Thursday morning.

An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late on Wednesday.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines call for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Macron’s table.

Boris Johnson, who had an alarming scare with the virus in April, sent best wishes to his 'friend' Mr Macron in English and French on Thursday.

Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Sorry to hear my friend Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for coronavirus. We are all wishing you a speedy recovery.'

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said she was with the French president 'with all my heart'.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

A key aspect of the EU talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent.

The EU is lagging behind Britain, which has already begun injecting people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

A decision by the EU's regulator is expected in the coming days, according to officials including Germany's health minister Jens Spahn.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit, with Macron coming into close quarters with both Merkel and Von der Leyen.

He was also seen gesturing in Hungarian leader Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament president David Sassoli.

Days after the summit, Macron took Portugal's 59-year-old PM Antonio Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee.

He also welcomed dignitaries on Monday for an OECD meeting attended by Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez and European Council president Charles Michel.

Sanchez, Costa and Michel are among those isolating, although none of them say they have tested positive.

Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time, having quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Like other EU states, France is pinning its hopes on the vaccine to quell the virus and Castex said Wednesday the country will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population,' he added.

'Vaccines are a major source of hope but if you look at the vaccination capabilities that we will have in France and elsewhere in Europe, we will need time,' immunologist Jean-François Delfraissy told BFM television this morning.

Delfraissy estimated there were 22 million people in France more vulnerable than others and that it could take until May to vaccinate them all, before shots could be rolled out to others.

Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.

France had Europe's first virus case in January, but Macron's government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough.

A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.

But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals.

The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Like other EU states, France is pinning its hopes on the vaccine to quell the virus and Castex said Wednesday the country will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population,' he added.

'Vaccines are a major source of hope but if you look at the vaccination capabilities that we will have in France and elsewhere in Europe, we will need time,' immunologist Jean-François Delfraissy told BFM television this morning.

Delfraissy estimated there were 22 million people in France more vulnerable than others and that it could take until May to vaccinate them all, before shots could be rolled out to others.

Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.

France had Europe's first virus case in January, but Macron's government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough.

A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.

But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals.

The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.

'For nine months I have been battling people who measure the pandemic just by the number of closed bars and incite people against measures and the government,' he said.

'Now it seems it will be a different holiday.'

Macron is suffering a fever, a cough and fatigue and has a military doctor at his bedside in Versailles after catching coronavirus, it emerged today.

Macron, 42, is staying at a residence called La Lanterne after testing positive for Covid-19 in a result which sparked frantic contact-tracing among EU leaders.

The Elysee's chief physician Jean-Christophe Perrochon is staying with Macron during his quarantine, according to Le Parisien, while first lady Brigitte Macron, 67, is isolating separately in Paris.

While Macron is in a younger age group than most world leaders and is not known to have any medical problems, he had already developed symptoms by the time his diagnosis was announced on Thursday.

It comes as Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic today announced he has also tested positive for Covid-19, a week after he attended an EU summit in Brussels with Macron and 23 other EU leaders.

Health campaigners furious that Macron sat down with 10 senior colleagues for dinner By PETER ALLEN FOR MAILONLINE Criminal complaints that could result in prison sentences have been filed over a dinner organised by French President Emmanuel Macron before he went down with Coronavirus. Health campaigners are furious that the 42-year-old head of state sat down to a meal with up to 10 senior colleagues at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Wednesday evening. The next day, Mr Macron’s aides confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19, after displaying ‘mild symptoms’ caused by the virus. Not only was the dinner in the middle of an 8pm to 6am curfew in the French capital, but it broke government guidelines limiting the number sitting around a meal table to six. On Friday, two Paris-based pressure groups called ‘The Collective Victims of Coronavirus France’ and ‘The Hanged’ filed criminal complaints for ‘endangering the lives of others’. This is a criminal offence in France – one punishable by up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of €15,000 (£13,600). Maître Fabrice Di Vizio, the lawyer for the groups, said on Friday that the complaint had initially been filed against ‘X’, meaning it potentially targets anyone who helped organise the dinner, or who attended. Mr Macon will be excluded from any possible indictment, because as President of France he enjoys immunity from prosecution. Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, is also likely to enjoy legal privilege, according to those familiar with the complaint. But those who can potentially be taken to court include Richard Ferrand, the President of the National Assembly, the second chamber of France’s parliament. Christophe Castaner, the head of Mr Macron’s En Marche ! (On the Move) party in parliament and the former Interior Minister, is also a possible defendant. So too are En Marche ! MPs and key Macron policy advisors including Stanislas Guérini and Thierry Solère, all of whom were at the meal which went on until around 12.30am. Maître Di Vizio told Capital magazine that Élysée staff were threatened by the meal, ‘which did not fall within the framework of the exceptions provided for in the curfew: it was not urgent and could have been replaced by a videoconference.’ Paris prosecutors confirmed that the complaint had been filed, while the Élysée insisted that all health guidelines had been followed. ‘It was a working dinner, held in a large salon, with everyone involved abiding by social distancing guidelines,’ said a presidential source. Mr Macron had on Friday retired to La Lanterne, the official presidential residence in Versailles, west of Paris, to carry on working in isolation as he tried to get over his illness. Following his Coronavirus diagnosis, there were fears that the President may have infected others, after a frantic week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing. On Monday, Mr Macron was pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Élysée palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation. This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!' These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There’s no denying it.' Mr Macron’s wife, Brigitte Macron, is also self-isolating, but at the Élysée, and on not in Versailles. Advertisement

In the days before his positive test, he had rubbed shoulders with a long list of EU leaders in Paris and Brussels - with the leaders of Spain and Portugal among those now in isolation.

Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US president Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

He has also cancelled a planned December 22 trip to Lebanon, where he has been spearheading efforts at reform after the disastrous Beirut port explosion in August.

Last night, Macron appeared on screen at a conference on French foreign aid policy, wearing a mask but not looking visibly ill.

On Thursday, an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking hands with fellow politicians, saying: 'There's no denying it.'

Macron had embraced Portuguese premier Antonio Costa as recently as Wednesday, and shook hands with 70-year-old OECD chief Jose Angel Gurria on Monday.

A presidential official indicated that Macron was likely already infected by then because he had probably contracted the virus at last week's EU summit.

Macron mingled with fellow EU leaders in the summit room and was filmed giving fist-bumps to some of his counterparts.

Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic announced today he had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the summit.

'Today, I am one of you,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook page, attaching a screenshot of a text message with his test results.

German chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, tested negative for the virus after attending the summit along with all but two of the EU's 27 heads of government.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee said in a brief statement on Thursday morning.

An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late on Wednesday.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines call for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Macron’s table.

Boris Johnson, who had an alarming scare with the virus in April, sent best wishes to his 'friend' Mr Macron in English and French on Thursday.

Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Sorry to hear my friend Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for coronavirus. We are all wishing you a speedy recovery.'

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said she was with the French president 'with all my heart'.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

A key aspect of the EU talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent.

The EU is lagging behind Britain, which has already begun injecting people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

A decision by the EU's regulator is expected in the coming days, according to officials including Germany's health minister Jens Spahn.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit, with Macron coming into close quarters with both Merkel and Von der Leyen.

He was also seen gesturing in Hungarian leader Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament president David Sassoli.

Days after the summit, Macron took Portugal's 59-year-old PM Antonio Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee.

He also welcomed dignitaries on Monday for an OECD meeting attended by Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez and European Council president Charles Michel.

Sanchez, Costa and Michel are among those isolating, although none of them say they have tested positive.

Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time, having quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals.

The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.

France recorded more than 17,000 new cases on Wednesday - sparking concern as people shop and travel more ahead of the Christmas holidays

The virus has resurfaced in France - as across the rest of Europe - and there are grave fears that deaths could spike in the colder winter months

Macron is suffering a fever, a cough and fatigue and has a military doctor at his bedside in Versailles after catching coronavirus, it emerged today.

Macron, 42, is staying at a residence called La Lanterne after testing positive for Covid-19 in a result which sparked frantic contact-tracing among EU leaders.

Health campaigners furious that Macron sat down with 10 senior colleagues for dinner By PETER ALLEN FOR MAILONLINE Criminal complaints that could result in prison sentences have been filed over a dinner organised by French President Emmanuel Macron before he went down with Coronavirus. Health campaigners are furious that the 42-year-old head of state sat down to a meal with up to 10 senior colleagues at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Wednesday evening. The next day, Mr Macron’s aides confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19, after displaying ‘mild symptoms’ caused by the virus. Not only was the dinner in the middle of an 8pm to 6am curfew in the French capital, but it broke government guidelines limiting the number sitting around a meal table to six. On Friday, two Paris-based pressure groups called ‘The Collective Victims of Coronavirus France’ and ‘The Hanged’ filed criminal complaints for ‘endangering the lives of others’. This is a criminal offence in France – one punishable by up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of €15,000 (£13,600). Maître Fabrice Di Vizio, the lawyer for the groups, said on Friday that the complaint had initially been filed against ‘X’, meaning it potentially targets anyone who helped organise the dinner, or who attended. Mr Macon will be excluded from any possible indictment, because as President of France he enjoys immunity from prosecution. Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, is also likely to enjoy legal privilege, according to those familiar with the complaint. But those who can potentially be taken to court include Richard Ferrand, the President of the National Assembly, the second chamber of France’s parliament. Christophe Castaner, the head of Mr Macron’s En Marche ! (On the Move) party in parliament and the former Interior Minister, is also a possible defendant. So too are En Marche ! MPs and key Macron policy advisors including Stanislas Guérini and Thierry Solère, all of whom were at the meal which went on until around 12.30am. Maître Di Vizio told Capital magazine that Élysée staff were threatened by the meal, ‘which did not fall within the framework of the exceptions provided for in the curfew: it was not urgent and could have been replaced by a videoconference.’ Paris prosecutors confirmed that the complaint had been filed, while the Élysée insisted that all health guidelines had been followed. ‘It was a working dinner, held in a large salon, with everyone involved abiding by social distancing guidelines,’ said a presidential source. Mr Macron had on Friday retired to La Lanterne, the official presidential residence in Versailles, west of Paris, to carry on working in isolation as he tried to get over his illness. Following his Coronavirus diagnosis, there were fears that the President may have infected others, after a frantic week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing. On Monday, Mr Macron was pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Élysée palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation. This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!' These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There’s no denying it.' Mr Macron’s wife, Brigitte Macron, is also self-isolating, but at the Élysée, and on not in Versailles. Advertisement

In the days before his positive test, he had rubbed shoulders with a long list of EU leaders in Paris and Brussels - with the leaders of Spain and Portugal among those now in isolation.

Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US president Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

He has also cancelled a planned December 22 trip to Lebanon, where he has been spearheading efforts at reform after the disastrous Beirut port explosion in August.

Last night, Macron appeared on screen at a conference on French foreign aid policy, wearing a mask but not looking visibly ill.

On Thursday, an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking hands with fellow politicians, saying: 'There's no denying it.'

Macron had embraced Portuguese premier Antonio Costa as recently as Wednesday, and shook hands with 70-year-old OECD chief Jose Angel Gurria on Monday.

A presidential official indicated that Macron was likely already infected by then because he had probably contracted the virus at last week's EU summit.

Macron mingled with fellow EU leaders in the summit room and was filmed giving fist-bumps to some of his counterparts.

Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic announced today he had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the summit.

'Today, I am one of you,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook page, attaching a screenshot of a text message with his test results.

German chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, tested negative for the virus after attending the summit along with all but two of the EU's 27 heads of government.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee said in a brief statement on Thursday morning.

An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late on Wednesday.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines call for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Macron’s table.

Boris Johnson, who had an alarming scare with the virus in April, sent best wishes to his 'friend' Mr Macron in English and French on Thursday.

Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Sorry to hear my friend Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for coronavirus. We are all wishing you a speedy recovery.'

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said she was with the French president 'with all my heart'.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

A key aspect of the EU talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent.

The EU is lagging behind Britain, which has already begun injecting people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

A decision by the EU's regulator is expected in the coming days, according to officials including Germany's health minister Jens Spahn.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit, with Macron coming into close quarters with both Merkel and Von der Leyen.

He was also seen gesturing in Hungarian leader Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament president David Sassoli.

Days after the summit, Macron took Portugal's 59-year-old PM Antonio Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee.

He also welcomed dignitaries on Monday for an OECD meeting attended by Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez and European Council president Charles Michel.

Sanchez, Costa and Michel are among those isolating, although none of them say they have tested positive.

Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time, having quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Like other EU states, France is pinning its hopes on the vaccine to quell the virus and Castex said Wednesday the country will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population,' he added.

'Vaccines are a major source of hope but if you look at the vaccination capabilities that we will have in France and elsewhere in Europe, we will need time,' immunologist Jean-François Delfraissy told BFM television this morning.

Delfraissy estimated there were 22 million people in France more vulnerable than others and that it could take until May to vaccinate them all, before shots could be rolled out to others.

Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.

France had Europe's first virus case in January, but Macron's government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough.

Health campaigners furious that Macron sat down with 10 senior colleagues for dinner By PETER ALLEN FOR MAILONLINE Criminal complaints that could result in prison sentences have been filed over a dinner organised by French President Emmanuel Macron before he went down with Coronavirus. Health campaigners are furious that the 42-year-old head of state sat down to a meal with up to 10 senior colleagues at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Wednesday evening. The next day, Mr Macron’s aides confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19, after displaying ‘mild symptoms’ caused by the virus. Not only was the dinner in the middle of an 8pm to 6am curfew in the French capital, but it broke government guidelines limiting the number sitting around a meal table to six. On Friday, two Paris-based pressure groups called ‘The Collective Victims of Coronavirus France’ and ‘The Hanged’ filed criminal complaints for ‘endangering the lives of others’. This is a criminal offence in France – one punishable by up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of €15,000 (£13,600). Maître Fabrice Di Vizio, the lawyer for the groups, said on Friday that the complaint had initially been filed against ‘X’, meaning it potentially targets anyone who helped organise the dinner, or who attended. Mr Macon will be excluded from any possible indictment, because as President of France he enjoys immunity from prosecution. Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, is also likely to enjoy legal privilege, according to those familiar with the complaint. But those who can potentially be taken to court include Richard Ferrand, the President of the National Assembly, the second chamber of France’s parliament. Christophe Castaner, the head of Mr Macron’s En Marche ! (On the Move) party in parliament and the former Interior Minister, is also a possible defendant. So too are En Marche ! MPs and key Macron policy advisors including Stanislas Guérini and Thierry Solère, all of whom were at the meal which went on until around 12.30am. Maître Di Vizio told Capital magazine that Élysée staff were threatened by the meal, ‘which did not fall within the framework of the exceptions provided for in the curfew: it was not urgent and could have been replaced by a videoconference.’ Paris prosecutors confirmed that the complaint had been filed, while the Élysée insisted that all health guidelines had been followed. ‘It was a working dinner, held in a large salon, with everyone involved abiding by social distancing guidelines,’ said a presidential source. Mr Macron had on Friday retired to La Lanterne, the official presidential residence in Versailles, west of Paris, to carry on working in isolation as he tried to get over his illness. Following his Coronavirus diagnosis, there were fears that the President may have infected others, after a frantic week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing. On Monday, Mr Macron was pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Élysée palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation. This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!' These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There’s no denying it.' Mr Macron’s wife, Brigitte Macron, is also self-isolating, but at the Élysée, and on not in Versailles. Advertisement

In the days before his positive test, he had rubbed shoulders with a long list of EU leaders in Paris and Brussels - with the leaders of Spain and Portugal among those now in isolation.

Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US president Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

He has also cancelled a planned December 22 trip to Lebanon, where he has been spearheading efforts at reform after the disastrous Beirut port explosion in August.

Last night, Macron appeared on screen at a conference on French foreign aid policy, wearing a mask but not looking visibly ill.

On Thursday, an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking hands with fellow politicians, saying: 'There's no denying it.'

Macron had embraced Portuguese premier Antonio Costa as recently as Wednesday, and shook hands with 70-year-old OECD chief Jose Angel Gurria on Monday.

A presidential official indicated that Macron was likely already infected by then because he had probably contracted the virus at last week's EU summit.

Macron mingled with fellow EU leaders in the summit room and was filmed giving fist-bumps to some of his counterparts.

Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic announced today he had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the summit.

'Today, I am one of you,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook page, attaching a screenshot of a text message with his test results.

German chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, tested negative for the virus after attending the summit along with all but two of the EU's 27 heads of government.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee said in a brief statement on Thursday morning.

An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late on Wednesday.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines call for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Macron’s table.

Boris Johnson, who had an alarming scare with the virus in April, sent best wishes to his 'friend' Mr Macron in English and French on Thursday.

Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Sorry to hear my friend Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for coronavirus. We are all wishing you a speedy recovery.'

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said she was with the French president 'with all my heart'.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

A key aspect of the EU talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent.

The EU is lagging behind Britain, which has already begun injecting people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

A decision by the EU's regulator is expected in the coming days, according to officials including Germany's health minister Jens Spahn.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit, with Macron coming into close quarters with both Merkel and Von der Leyen.

He was also seen gesturing in Hungarian leader Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament president David Sassoli.

Days after the summit, Macron took Portugal's 59-year-old PM Antonio Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee.

He also welcomed dignitaries on Monday for an OECD meeting attended by Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez and European Council president Charles Michel.

Sanchez, Costa and Michel are among those isolating, although none of them say they have tested positive.

Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time, having quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Like other EU states, France is pinning its hopes on the vaccine to quell the virus and Castex said Wednesday the country will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population,' he added.

'Vaccines are a major source of hope but if you look at the vaccination capabilities that we will have in France and elsewhere in Europe, we will need time,' immunologist Jean-François Delfraissy told BFM television this morning.

Delfraissy estimated there were 22 million people in France more vulnerable than others and that it could take until May to vaccinate them all, before shots could be rolled out to others.

Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.

France had Europe's first virus case in January, but Macron's government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough.

A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.

But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals.

The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.

Macron is suffering a fever, a cough and fatigue and has a military doctor at his bedside in Versailles after catching coronavirus, it emerged today.

Macron, 42, is staying at a residence called La Lanterne after testing positive for Covid-19 in a result which sparked frantic contact-tracing among EU leaders.

2020-12-18 19:21:04+00:00,4,"Former Princess Tessy of Luxembourg has revealed she is still suffering from the after effects of Covid-19, three weeks after her diagnosis.

The ex-royal, 34, who lives in London and spent much of lockdown with her two sons Prince Gabriel of Nassau, 14, and Prince Noah of Nassau, 12, shared an Instagram video at the start of the month where she said she was in 'a lot of pain'.

Tessy has now revealed she is still struggling with the impact of the disease, sharing a snap on her Instagram as she travelled to a doctors appointment.

She wrote: 'My - have not slept - face. Some of the side effects of corona can be huge stomach pains due to the intake of medication.'

Former Princess Tessy of Luxembourg, 34, who is currently living in London, has revealed she is still suffering from the after effects of Covid-19, three weeks after her diagnosis

The former royal continued: 'Make sure you eat something small before taking any medication.'

She added: 'Never been so happy to see a doctor!'

Tessy first revealed her diagnosis at the start of the month in a video clip shared to Instagram.

During the clip, she said she was currently on 'day three of corona at home', saying: 'I hope you have all started your December in the right way. I started it with a bang.

The former royal, who currently lives in London with her sons Prince Gabriel of Nassau, 14, and Prince Noah of Nassau, 12, said she had been left 'very tired' from the disease

'I'm feeling much better, my fever is much better. I'm in a lot of pain but the rest is fine. After this I'm going to go to bed.'

She later said she planned to 'pass out', adding: 'Thankyou so much for the wishes, I'm well, just very tired.'

Tessy's diagnosis came days after a spate of royals across Europe tested positive for the disease.

Earlier this month, it emerged Sweden's Prince Carl Philip and his wife Princess Sofia had also tested positive for coronavirus.

The mother-of-two revealed at the start of the month she has tested positive for coronavirus and said the illness has left her in 'a lot of pain'

The pair, aged 41 and 35, suffered 'light flu symptoms' and isolated at their home in Stockholm with sons Prince Alexander, four, and Prince Gabriel, three.

Meanwhile it was also announced last month that Princess Michael of Kent, 75, had been diagnosed with coronavirus and was suffering from 'extreme fatigue and terrible fevers'.

The royal, who is married to the Queen's first cousin Prince Michael of Kent, was unwell for nearly a month, her spokesman confirmed.

Simon Astaire said Princess Michael tested positive for coronavirus after her housekeeper 'fell ill' in November.

The former Princess, who lost her title after divorcing Louis last April, is said to have maintained a close relationship with ex husband Louis, 34

Tessy of Luxembourg wed Louis in 2006, and has two children Prince Gabriel of Nassau and Prince Noah of Nassau with the Prince, who is the third son of the country's reigning monarch Grand Duke Henri.

The former Princess, who lost her title after divorcing Louis last April, is said to have maintained a close relationship with ex husband Louis, 34.

The couple's fairytale marriage broke down in 2016, and they were granted a decree nisi in February 2017, after 12 years together.

Tessy's diagnosis came days after it emerged Sweden's Prince Carl Philip (left) and Princess Sofia (right) tested positive for coronavirus

They were only 20 when they wed in 2006, getting married six months after the birth of their eldest son Prince Gabriel of Nassau.

Prince Louis, who will now pay £8,000 a year child support, renounced his succession rights to the throne in 2006, a month after marrying Tessy - who was not born of royal blood - but to a modest family in the small town of Niederkorn.

At a hearing in December, Louis was ordered to pay just £75-a-week to each of his two sons after a judge found his family's vast wealth could not be factored into a divorce battle with his ex-wife.

Meanwhile it was reported recently Princess Michael of Kent had been diagnosed with the illness and was suffering from 'extreme fatigue and terrible fevers'

Louis now lives in Paris, while Tessy juggles a busy work life with raising the couple's two children across the Channel.

The EU summit is believed to be where French President Emmanuel Macron caught the virus, leading a host of European leaders and top French officials to rush into self-isolation

The Elysee's chief physician Jean-Christophe Perrochon is staying with Macron during his quarantine, according to Le Parisien, while first lady Brigitte Macron, 67, is isolating separately in Paris.

While Macron is in a younger age group than most world leaders and is not known to have any medical problems, he had already developed symptoms by the time his diagnosis was announced on Thursday.

It comes as Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic today announced he has also tested positive for Covid-19, a week after he attended an EU summit in Brussels with Macron and 23 other EU leaders.

Health campaigners furious that Macron sat down with 10 senior colleagues for dinner By PETER ALLEN FOR MAILONLINE Criminal complaints that could result in prison sentences have been filed over a dinner organised by French President Emmanuel Macron before he went down with Coronavirus. Health campaigners are furious that the 42-year-old head of state sat down to a meal with up to 10 senior colleagues at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Wednesday evening. The next day, Mr Macron’s aides confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19, after displaying ‘mild symptoms’ caused by the virus. Not only was the dinner in the middle of an 8pm to 6am curfew in the French capital, but it broke government guidelines limiting the number sitting around a meal table to six. On Friday, two Paris-based pressure groups called ‘The Collective Victims of Coronavirus France’ and ‘The Hanged’ filed criminal complaints for ‘endangering the lives of others’. This is a criminal offence in France – one punishable by up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of €15,000 (£13,600). Maître Fabrice Di Vizio, the lawyer for the groups, said on Friday that the complaint had initially been filed against ‘X’, meaning it potentially targets anyone who helped organise the dinner, or who attended. Mr Macon will be excluded from any possible indictment, because as President of France he enjoys immunity from prosecution. Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, is also likely to enjoy legal privilege, according to those familiar with the complaint. But those who can potentially be taken to court include Richard Ferrand, the President of the National Assembly, the second chamber of France’s parliament. Christophe Castaner, the head of Mr Macron’s En Marche ! (On the Move) party in parliament and the former Interior Minister, is also a possible defendant. So too are En Marche ! MPs and key Macron policy advisors including Stanislas Guérini and Thierry Solère, all of whom were at the meal which went on until around 12.30am. Maître Di Vizio told Capital magazine that Élysée staff were threatened by the meal, ‘which did not fall within the framework of the exceptions provided for in the curfew: it was not urgent and could have been replaced by a videoconference.’ Paris prosecutors confirmed that the complaint had been filed, while the Élysée insisted that all health guidelines had been followed. ‘It was a working dinner, held in a large salon, with everyone involved abiding by social distancing guidelines,’ said a presidential source. Mr Macron had on Friday retired to La Lanterne, the official presidential residence in Versailles, west of Paris, to carry on working in isolation as he tried to get over his illness. Following his Coronavirus diagnosis, there were fears that the President may have infected others, after a frantic week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing. On Monday, Mr Macron was pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Élysée palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation. This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!' These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There’s no denying it.' Mr Macron’s wife, Brigitte Macron, is also self-isolating, but at the Élysée, and on not in Versailles. Advertisement

In the days before his positive test, he had rubbed shoulders with a long list of EU leaders in Paris and Brussels - with the leaders of Spain and Portugal among those now in isolation.

Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US president Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

He has also cancelled a planned December 22 trip to Lebanon, where he has been spearheading efforts at reform after the disastrous Beirut port explosion in August.

Last night, Macron appeared on screen at a conference on French foreign aid policy, wearing a mask but not looking visibly ill.

On Thursday, an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking hands with fellow politicians, saying: 'There's no denying it.'

Macron had embraced Portuguese premier Antonio Costa as recently as Wednesday, and shook hands with 70-year-old OECD chief Jose Angel Gurria on Monday.

A presidential official indicated that Macron was likely already infected by then because he had probably contracted the virus at last week's EU summit.

Macron mingled with fellow EU leaders in the summit room and was filmed giving fist-bumps to some of his counterparts.

Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic announced today he had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the summit.

'Today, I am one of you,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook page, attaching a screenshot of a text message with his test results.

German chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, tested negative for the virus after attending the summit along with all but two of the EU's 27 heads of government.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee said in a brief statement on Thursday morning.

An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late on Wednesday.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines call for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Macron’s table.

Boris Johnson, who had an alarming scare with the virus in April, sent best wishes to his 'friend' Mr Macron in English and French on Thursday.

Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Sorry to hear my friend Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for coronavirus. We are all wishing you a speedy recovery.'

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said she was with the French president 'with all my heart'.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

A key aspect of the EU talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent.

The EU is lagging behind Britain, which has already begun injecting people with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

A decision by the EU's regulator is expected in the coming days, according to officials including Germany's health minister Jens Spahn.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit, with Macron coming into close quarters with both Merkel and Von der Leyen.

He was also seen gesturing in Hungarian leader Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament president David Sassoli.

Days after the summit, Macron took Portugal's 59-year-old PM Antonio Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee.

He also welcomed dignitaries on Monday for an OECD meeting attended by Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez and European Council president Charles Michel.

Sanchez, Costa and Michel are among those isolating, although none of them say they have tested positive.

Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time, having quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Like other EU states, France is pinning its hopes on the vaccine to quell the virus and Castex said Wednesday the country will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population,' he added.

'Vaccines are a major source of hope but if you look at the vaccination capabilities that we will have in France and elsewhere in Europe, we will need time,' immunologist Jean-François Delfraissy told BFM television this morning.

Delfraissy estimated there were 22 million people in France more vulnerable than others and that it could take until May to vaccinate them all, before shots could be rolled out to others.

Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.

France had Europe's first virus case in January, but Macron's government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough.

A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.

But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals.

The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.

France recorded more than 17,000 new cases on Wednesday - sparking concern as people shop and travel more ahead of the Christmas holidays

The virus has resurfaced in France - as across the rest of Europe - and there are grave fears that deaths could spike in the colder winter months

2020-12-18 16:21:08+00:00,6,"Former Princess Tessy of Luxembourg has revealed she is still suffering from the after effects of Covid-19, three weeks after her diagnosis.

The ex-royal, 34, who lives in London and spent much of lockdown with her two sons Prince Gabriel of Nassau, 14, and Prince Noah of Nassau, 12, shared an Instagram video at the start of the month where she said she was in 'a lot of pain'.

Tessy has now revealed she is still struggling with the impact of the disease, sharing a snap on her Instagram as she travelled to a doctors appointment.

She wrote: 'My - have not slept - face. Some of the side effects of corona can be huge stomach pains due to the intake of medication.'

Former Princess Tessy of Luxembourg, 34, who is currently living in London, has revealed she is still suffering from the after effects of Covid-19, three weeks after her diagnosis

The former royal continued: 'Make sure you eat something small before taking any medication.'

She added: 'Never been so happy to see a doctor!'

Tessy first revealed her diagnosis at the start of the month in a video clip shared to Instagram.

During the clip, she said she was currently on 'day three of corona at home', saying: 'I hope you have all started your December in the right way. I started it with a bang.

The former royal, who currently lives in London with her sons Prince Gabriel of Nassau, 14, and Prince Noah of Nassau, 12, said she had been left 'very tired' from the disease

'I'm feeling much better, my fever is much better. I'm in a lot of pain but the rest is fine. After this I'm going to go to bed.'

She later said she planned to 'pass out', adding: 'Thankyou so much for the wishes, I'm well, just very tired.'

Tessy's diagnosis came days after a spate of royals across Europe tested positive for the disease.

Earlier this month, it emerged Sweden's Prince Carl Philip and his wife Princess Sofia had also tested positive for coronavirus.

The mother-of-two revealed at the start of the month she has tested positive for coronavirus and said the illness has left her in 'a lot of pain'

The pair, aged 41 and 35, suffered 'light flu symptoms' and isolated at their home in Stockholm with sons Prince Alexander, four, and Prince Gabriel, three.

Meanwhile it was also announced last month that Princess Michael of Kent, 75, had been diagnosed with coronavirus and was suffering from 'extreme fatigue and terrible fevers'.

The royal, who is married to the Queen's first cousin Prince Michael of Kent, was unwell for nearly a month, her spokesman confirmed.

Simon Astaire said Princess Michael tested positive for coronavirus after her housekeeper 'fell ill' in November.

The former Princess, who lost her title after divorcing Louis last April, is said to have maintained a close relationship with ex husband Louis, 34

Tessy of Luxembourg wed Louis in 2006, and has two children Prince Gabriel of Nassau and Prince Noah of Nassau with the Prince, who is the third son of the country's reigning monarch Grand Duke Henri.

The former Princess, who lost her title after divorcing Louis last April, is said to have maintained a close relationship with ex husband Louis, 34.

The couple's fairytale marriage broke down in 2016, and they were granted a decree nisi in February 2017, after 12 years together.

Tessy's diagnosis came days after it emerged Sweden's Prince Carl Philip (left) and Princess Sofia (right) tested positive for coronavirus

They were only 20 when they wed in 2006, getting married six months after the birth of their eldest son Prince Gabriel of Nassau.

Prince Louis, who will now pay £8,000 a year child support, renounced his succession rights to the throne in 2006, a month after marrying Tessy - who was not born of royal blood - but to a modest family in the small town of Niederkorn.

At a hearing in December, Louis was ordered to pay just £75-a-week to each of his two sons after a judge found his family's vast wealth could not be factored into a divorce battle with his ex-wife.

Meanwhile it was reported recently Princess Michael of Kent had been diagnosed with the illness and was suffering from 'extreme fatigue and terrible fevers'

Louis now lives in Paris, while Tessy juggles a busy work life with raising the couple's two children across the Channel.

2020-12-18 06:09:55+00:00,19,"World Health Organisation (WHO) scientists will travel to Wuhan in January to investigate the origins of Covid-19 after months of negotiating with China for access.

The international mission is expected to go to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the virus that sparked the coronavirus pandemic, WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson confirmed.

A year into the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.6 million people and infected over 73 million globally, the question of where the virus came from and how it first crossed over to humans remains a mystery.

Pictured: Workers in protective suits walk past the Hankou railway station in Wuhan in China's Hubei province, April 2020. Wuhan is belieed to have been where the Covid-19 outbreak, that sparked the global pandemic, began. The first case was reported on December 31, 2019

The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak's extent, has called for a 'transparent' WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research.

China reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, central China, to the WHO on December 31 and closed a so called 'wet market' where the novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged.

Health ministers called on the WHO in May to identify the source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier, and the UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the international probe.

But it has until now remained unclear when the larger team of scientists would be able to travel to China to begin epidemiological studies to try to identify the first human cases and their source of infection.

Now a team of 12-15 international experts is finally preparing to go to Wuhan to examine evidence, including human and animal samples collected by Chinese researchers, and to build on their initial studies.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member, said that the team would leave 'just after New Year's' for a six-week mission, including two weeks of quarantine on arrival.

The international mission is expected to go to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the virus. The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak's extent, has called for a 'transparent' WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research

'Phase 1 was supposed to be completed by now, according to the terms of reference, and we should have some results. If that's what we get when we come to China...that would be fantastic. Then we are already in phase 2,' she told Reuters.

Keith Hamilton, an expert at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) who will take part, told reporters on Tuesday: 'I anticipate the mission will take place quite soon.'

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an emailed reply to Reuters inquiry that the international team was working on logistical arrangements to travel to China as soon as possible. 'We hope the team will be able to travel in January,' he said.

A Western diplomat said that the team was expected to leave in early January, ahead of WHO's executive board opening on January 18, adding: 'There is strong pressure on China and on WHO.'

Hamilton said a similar but not identical virus was identified in a horseshoe bat, indicating that it was transmitted first to an animal, or intermediate host, before infecting humans.

'When we are doing animal surveillance, it's difficult, it's rather like looking for a needle in a haystack,' he said.

China reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, central China, to the WHO on December 31 and closed a so called 'wet market' where the novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged. Pictured: A street vendor prepares steamed delicacies in Wuhan

Chinese state media have suggested the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing its presence on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe last year

Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO's top expert in animal diseases, said last month the mission would like to interview market workers about how they were infected with the virus.

'There is nothing to indicate that it would be man-made,' he added.

Chinese state media have suggested the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing its presence on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe last year.

Some Western countries have voiced concern at the delay in sending international experts.

One senior Western diplomat complained of a lack of transparency while experts were not on the ground talking to clinicians and researchers or inspecting lab samples.

But another Western diplomat said that the mission was on a 'good footing' and that the WHO had to accept China's terms to secure access.

Pictured: World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Health ministers called on the WHO in May to identify the source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier

Scientists initially believed the killer virus jumped from animals to humans at a market selling exotic animals for meat in the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected late last year.

But experts now think the market may not have been the origin of the outbreak, but rather a place where it was amplified.

It is widely assumed that the virus originally came from bats, but the intermediate animal host that transmitted it between bats and humans remains unknown.

2020-12-17 22:35:21+00:00,5,"French President Emmanuel Macron - who is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus - has conceded that he made a mistake in shaking someone's hand.

The 42-year-old head of state admitted his error on Thursday, hours after the Élysée Palace announced he was ill and going into isolation – prompting frantic contact tracing across Europe to try and find others he may have infected.

There were fears that the President may have infected others, however, after a week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing.

There were also accusations that President Macron had broken his own government's guidelines over six people being allowed to sit down to share a meal.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee Palace said in a brief statement on Thursday morning. An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late Wednesday.

TODAY: French President Emmanuel Macron is seen on a screen wearing a face mask and giving the thumbs up to the camera after he tested for Covid-19 and is now self-isolating

'This diagnosis was made following a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test performed at the onset of the first symptoms.'

The statement insisted that Mr Macron 'will continue to work and carry out his activities remotely,' while aides said he was not seriously ill and would appear regularly on video streams.

Mr Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

Prime Minister Johnson, who has not met Mr Macron face-to-face for months and been snubbed on Brexit negotiations, wished his 'friend' a swift recovery.

Frantic contact tracing is now afoot with the president having been centre stage in Brexit negotiations. Only yesterday, he was pictured embracing the Prime Minister of Portugal Antonio Costa in Paris.

Mr Costa is in self isolation, as is Mr Macron's wife Brigitte, 67, and Spain's PM Pedro Sanchez and President of the European Council Charles Michel who both met the French leader on Monday.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

Mr Macron joined dozens of other European leaders, including Ms von der Leyen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a summit in Brussels last Thursday and Friday.

Mrs Merkel has since tested negative for Covid, her office said today.

A key aspect of their talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent - the EU is lagging behind Britain because its central regulatory body must take into account all 27 member states - the bureaucrats have managed to cut down their expedited process of 210 days to fewer than 150.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit and Mr Macron was pictured having tête-à-têtes with President von der Leyen and Mrs Merkel.

He was also seen gesturing in the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from the Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament President David Sassoli.

Tactile Mr Macron was frequently pictured touching counterparts at those discussions and on Wednesday the French President took the 59-year-old PM of Portugal Mr Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee Palace.

Mr Macron was also pictured welcoming dignitaries with fond clinches at the palace on Monday for a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

In attendance were European Council President Michel, Spanish PM Sanchez, UNESCO general director Audrey Azoulay and OECD chief Angel Gurria.

Today, Prime Ministers Sanchez and Costa, Commission President Michel, French PM Jean Castex and President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand all announced that they will be self-isolating.

None of them said that they had tested positive.

Mr Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time - she quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

As result of the diagnosis, a trip next week by Mr Macron to Lebanon - where the president had been pressing for far-reaching political change after the giant Beirut port explosion in August - has been cancelled.

France recorded more than 17,000 new cases on Wednesday - sparking concern as people shop and travel more ahead of the Christmas holidays

The virus has resurfaced in France - as across the rest of Europe - and there are grave fears that deaths could spike in the colder winter months

Mr Macron held the government's weekly Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and the day before had lunch with the heads of political groups at the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.

The virus has an incubation period of 14 days, meaning that anyone who came into contact with Mr Macron up to December 3 would be advised to either get tested or self-isolate.

A theory as to how Mr Macron may have caught the virus has not yet been advanced.

The French president is one of several heads of state and government around the world who have contracted Covid-19, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population', he added.

2020-12-17 18:45:08+00:00,14,"World Health Organisation (WHO) scientists will travel to Wuhan in January to investigate the origins of Covid-19 after months of negotiating with China for access.

The international mission is expected to go to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the virus that sparked the coronavirus pandemic, WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson confirmed.

A year into the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.6 million people and infected over 73 million globally, the question of where the virus came from and how it first crossed over to humans remains a mystery.

Pictured: Workers in protective suits walk past the Hankou railway station in Wuhan in China's Hubei province, April 2020. Wuhan is belieed to have been where the Covid-19 outbreak, that sparked the global pandemic, began. The first case was reported on December 31, 2019

The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak's extent, has called for a 'transparent' WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research.

China reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, central China, to the WHO on December 31 and closed a so called 'wet market' where the novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged.

Health ministers called on the WHO in May to identify the source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier, and the UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the international probe.

But it has until now remained unclear when the larger team of scientists would be able to travel to China to begin epidemiological studies to try to identify the first human cases and their source of infection.

Now a team of 12-15 international experts is finally preparing to go to Wuhan to examine evidence, including human and animal samples collected by Chinese researchers, and to build on their initial studies.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member, said that the team would leave 'just after New Year's' for a six-week mission, including two weeks of quarantine on arrival.

'Phase 1 was supposed to be completed by now, according to the terms of reference, and we should have some results. If that's what we get when we come to China...that would be fantastic. Then we are already in phase 2,' she told Reuters.

Keith Hamilton, an expert at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) who will take part, told reporters on Tuesday: 'I anticipate the mission will take place quite soon.'

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an emailed reply to Reuters inquiry that the international team was working on logistical arrangements to travel to China as soon as possible. 'We hope the team will be able to travel in January,' he said.

A Western diplomat said that the team was expected to leave in early January, ahead of WHO's executive board opening on January 18, adding: 'There is strong pressure on China and on WHO.'

Hamilton said a similar but not identical virus was identified in a horseshoe bat, indicating that it was transmitted first to an animal, or intermediate host, before infecting humans.

'When we are doing animal surveillance, it's difficult, it's rather like looking for a needle in a haystack,' he said.

Chinese state media have suggested the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing its presence on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe last year.

Some Western countries have voiced concern at the delay in sending international experts.

One senior Western diplomat complained of a lack of transparency while experts were not on the ground talking to clinicians and researchers or inspecting lab samples.

But another Western diplomat said that the mission was on a 'good footing' and that the WHO had to accept China's terms to secure access.

But experts now think the market may not have been the origin of the outbreak, but rather a place where it was amplified.

2020-12-17 18:01:29+00:00,6,"French President Emmanuel Macron - who is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus - has conceded that he made a mistake in shaking someone's hand.

The 42-year-old head of state admitted his error on Thursday, hours after the Élysée Palace announced he was ill and going into isolation – prompting frantic contact tracing across Europe to try and find others he may have infected.

There were fears that the President may have infected others, however, after a week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing.

There were also accusations that President Macron had broken his own government's guidelines over six people being allowed to sit down to share a meal.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee Palace said in a brief statement on Thursday morning. An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late Wednesday.

TODAY: French President Emmanuel Macron is seen on a screen wearing a face mask and giving the thumbs up to the camera after he tested for Covid-19 and is now self-isolating

'This diagnosis was made following a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test performed at the onset of the first symptoms.'

The statement insisted that Mr Macron 'will continue to work and carry out his activities remotely,' while aides said he was not seriously ill and would appear regularly on video streams.

Mr Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

Prime Minister Johnson, who has not met Mr Macron face-to-face for months and been snubbed on Brexit negotiations, wished his 'friend' a swift recovery.

Frantic contact tracing is now afoot with the president having been centre stage in Brexit negotiations. Only yesterday, he was pictured embracing the Prime Minister of Portugal Antonio Costa in Paris.

Mr Costa is in self isolation, as is Mr Macron's wife Brigitte, 67, and Spain's PM Pedro Sanchez and President of the European Council Charles Michel who both met the French leader on Monday.

Mr Macron was also pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Elysee palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation.

This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!'

These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There's no denying it.'

Jean Castex, France’s Prime Minister, said he would also self-isolate after coming into regular contact with his boss.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and France’s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines are for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Mr Macron’s table.

2020-12-17 17:15:36+00:00,11,"A German town has began storing its dead in a mobile freezer after space in hospital morgues ran out amid a surge in coronavirus fatalities.

Cemetery workers in Hanau, 10 miles outside of Frankfurt, began using the mobile freezer on Thursday, with two bodies currently inside.

It comes after the country suffered a record 956 deaths on Wednesday. The toll on Thursday was 698, Germany's second-highest total of the pandemic.

Those figures contributed to Europe passing the grim milestone of 500,000 coronavrius deaths on Thursday, becoming the first world region to do so.

Dead bodies in the German town of Hanau are now being stored in a temporary freezer after morgues overflowed amid a surge in coronavirus deaths

Cemetery workers said two bodies were being stored in the container on Thursday, which was first brought to the town in April but has not been used until now

Latin America and the Caribbean have reported 477,404 deaths, the United States and Canada 321,287, Asia 208,149, the Middle East 85,895, and Africa 57,423.

Speaking about the freezers in Hanau, head of cemeteries Alexandra Kinski said they had initially been brought to the town in April as a precaution.

'Unfortunately the situation in Hanau has changed so much that we now need to make use of the containers,' she added.

'If a person passes away and there is no space in the clinic then they come here and stay for a short while until the deceased is taken to a final resting place.'

Seven-day average data for Germany, which accounts for natural peaks and troughs in the data, shows that deaths have been rising consistently since early November.

The seven-day average figure as of Thursday stood at 536, more than double the 233 peak during the first wave. Germany's total death toll stands at 24,125.

The country also reported 26,923 new cases on Thursday, bringing its total to more than 1.4million.

Seven-day average case data shows infections have been rising for the last fortnight.

Germany, initially praised for its virus response during the first wave, has been hard-hit during a second wave after it shunned going into a full-scale lockdown of the kind seen in other European countries during the autumn.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has now been forced to change tack, bringing in a 'hard lockdown' on Wednesday that saw shops and schools closed until January with social gatherings limited over the Christmas holidays.

Alcohol is banned in public places - putting a halt to traditional mulled wine stands at Christmas markets - while hairdressers and salons are also shutting down.

Merkel agreed the tough restrictions with state leaders on Sunday and has repeatedly sounded the alarm about the high infection rate.

Germany is being hit hard by a coronavirus second wave that has pushed the seven-day average for cases up to record levels (pictured)

Seven-day average death data, which accounts for natural peaks and troughs in how numbers are reported, has also risen to a record figure as the outbreak spirals out of control

Under Germany's federal system, the states have the final say, and some are adopting even tougher measures - with Saxony imposing a 10pm curfew and Bavaria enacting stay-at-home rules similar to those in other countries.

Schools stayed open during the 'lockdown light', but are moving to distance learning from Wednesday until at least January 10.

Companies in Europe's largest economy are also being encouraged to allow their employees to work from home during the month-long shutdown.

'That would help to implement the principle 'we're staying at home',' according to the policy paper agreed by Merkel and state premiers.

Social gatherings are restricted to five people from two households, although children aged under 14 are not counted towards the limit.

The rules are being slightly relaxed from December 24-26, when any one household can meet four other people - meaning the total number can rise above five.

However, there is no relaxation over the New Year, and traditional firework displays have been banned in public places.

Shops are also closing down for the first time since the spring, with only essential stores such as supermarkets allowed to remain open.

The typically cautious Merkel last week made an unusually impassioned appeal for Germans to keep their discipline over the Christmas period.

'If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we'd really have failed,' she said.

While Merkel remains largely popular, Germany's long-admired pandemic response has come under greater scrutiny as the death toll continues to climb.

Many European countries saw their infection rates fall after imposing new measures in October and November, but Germany has yet to see a significant drop.

A security guard closes the iron gate at Berlin's famous KaDeWe department store last night as it closes its doors during Germany's second national lockdown

After stabilising for a a few weeks, infections started to rise again at the start of December and the last week has seen a record of more than 160,000 cases.

Some parts of Germany, especially in the former East, which had escaped the first wave of the pandemic relatively lightly are now seeing a massive spread of Covid-19.

The death toll, which only once rose above 300 per day during the spring, is now at an average of almost 500.

And while the German health system has generally handled the crisis well, the number of patients in intensive care is now at an all-time record of 4,735.

Merkel's economy minister Peter Altmaier and Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder have both described the virus situation as 'out of control' in Germany.

Soeder, seen as a possible contender for Merkel's job when she leaves office next year, warned this week that Germany could become the 'problem child' of Europe.

The one ray of hope for Germany was a prediction by health minister Jens Spahn that vaccinations could still begin before Christmas.

Spahn told German television that jabs with the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine could begin within two to four days of an approval by the European Medicines Agency.

The jab has already been approved in Britain, but Spahn has voiced impatience with EU regulators in recent days, finally receiving assurances that the EMA will finalise the approval process by December 23.

Germany has set up some 440 vaccination centres, has 10,000 doctors and medical staff ready and is ready to start mass vaccinations immediately, Spahn says.

'Our goal is an approval before Christmas,' Spahn said. 'We want to still start vaccinating this year.'",MailOnline,"['spahn', 'record', 'wave', 'total', 'temporary', 'dead', 'average', 'overflow', 'germany', 'christmas', 'stored', 'morgues', 'coronavirus', 'germanys', 'town', 'freezer', 'toll']",0

2020-12-17 14:30:09+00:00,2,"French President Emmanuel Macron - who is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus - has conceded that he made a mistake in shaking someone's hand.

The 42-year-old head of state admitted his error on Thursday, hours after the Élysée Palace announced he was ill and going into isolation – prompting frantic contact tracing across Europe to try and find others he may have infected.

There were fears that the President may have infected others, however, after a week during which Mr Macron appeared to have little interest in social distancing.

There were also accusations that President Macron had broken his own government's guidelines over six people being allowed to sit down to share a meal.

The president took a test 'as soon as the first symptoms appeared,' the Elysee Palace said in a brief statement on Thursday morning. An official added later that he was experiencing 'light symptoms' which he had started to feel late Wednesday.

TODAY: French President Emmanuel Macron is seen on a screen wearing a face mask and giving the thumbs up to the camera after he tested for Covid-19 and is now self-isolating

'This diagnosis was made following a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test performed at the onset of the first symptoms.'

The statement insisted that Mr Macron 'will continue to work and carry out his activities remotely,' while aides said he was not seriously ill and would appear regularly on video streams.

Mr Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

Prime Minister Johnson, who has not met Mr Macron face-to-face for months and been snubbed on Brexit negotiations, wished his 'friend' a swift recovery.

Frantic contact tracing is now afoot with the president having been centre stage in Brexit negotiations. Only yesterday, he was pictured embracing the Prime Minister of Portugal Antonio Costa in Paris.

Mr Costa is in self isolation, as is Mr Macron's wife Brigitte, 67, and Spain's PM Pedro Sanchez and President of the European Council Charles Michel who both met the French leader on Monday.

Mr Macron was also pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Elysee palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation.

This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!'

These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There's no denying it.'

Jean Castex, France’s Prime Minister, said he would also self-isolate after coming into regular contact with his boss.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and France’s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines are for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Mr Macron’s table.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

Mr Macron joined dozens of other European leaders, including Ms von der Leyen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a summit in Brussels last Thursday and Friday.

Mrs Merkel has since tested negative for Covid, her office said today.

A key aspect of their talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent - the EU is lagging behind Britain because its central regulatory body must take into account all 27 member states - the bureaucrats have managed to cut down their expedited process of 210 days to fewer than 150.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit and Mr Macron was pictured having tête-à-têtes with President von der Leyen and Mrs Merkel.

He was also seen gesturing in the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from the Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament President David Sassoli.

Tactile Mr Macron was frequently pictured touching counterparts at those discussions and on Wednesday the French President took the 59-year-old PM of Portugal Mr Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee Palace.

Mr Macron was also pictured welcoming dignitaries with fond clinches at the palace on Monday for a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

In attendance were European Council President Michel, Spanish PM Sanchez, UNESCO general director Audrey Azoulay and OECD chief Angel Gurria.

Today, Prime Ministers Sanchez and Costa, Commission President Michel, French PM Jean Castex and President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand all announced that they will be self-isolating.

None of them said that they had tested positive.

Mr Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time - she quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

As result of the diagnosis, a trip next week by Mr Macron to Lebanon - where the president had been pressing for far-reaching political change after the giant Beirut port explosion in August - has been cancelled.

France recorded more than 17,000 new cases on Wednesday - sparking concern as people shop and travel more ahead of the Christmas holidays

The virus has resurfaced in France - as across the rest of Europe - and there are grave fears that deaths could spike in the colder winter months

Mr Macron held the government's weekly Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and the day before had lunch with the heads of political groups at the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.

The virus has an incubation period of 14 days, meaning that anyone who came into contact with Mr Macron up to December 3 would be advised to either get tested or self-isolate.

A theory as to how Mr Macron may have caught the virus has not yet been advanced.

The French president is one of several heads of state and government around the world who have contracted Covid-19, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population', he added.

2020-12-17 13:45:06+00:00,6,"World Health Organisation (WHO) scientists will travel to Wuhan in January to investigate the origins of Covid-19 after months of negotiating with China for access.

The international mission is expected to go to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the virus that sparked the coronavirus pandemic, WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson confirmed.

A year into the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.6 million people and infected over 73 million globally, the question of where the virus came from and how it first crossed over to humans remains a mystery.

Pictured: Workers in protective suits walk past the Hankou railway station in Wuhan in China's Hubei province, April 2020. Wuhan is belieed to have been where the Covid-19 outbreak, that sparked the global pandemic, began. The first case was reported on December 31, 2019

The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak's extent, has called for a 'transparent' WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research.

China reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, central China, to the WHO on December 31 and closed a so called 'wet market' where the novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged.

Health ministers called on the WHO in May to identify the source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier, and the UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the international probe.

But it has until now remained unclear when the larger team of scientists would be able to travel to China to begin epidemiological studies to try to identify the first human cases and their source of infection.

Now a team of 12-15 international experts is finally preparing to go to Wuhan to examine evidence, including human and animal samples collected by Chinese researchers, and to build on their initial studies.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member, said that the team would leave 'just after New Year's' for a six-week mission, including two weeks of quarantine on arrival.

The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak's extent, has called for a 'transparent' WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research

'Phase 1 was supposed to be completed by now, according to the terms of reference, and we should have some results. If that's what we get when we come to China...that would be fantastic. Then we are already in phase 2,' she told Reuters.

Keith Hamilton, an expert at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) who will take part, told reporters on Tuesday: 'I anticipate the mission will take place quite soon.'

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an emailed reply to Reuters inquiry that the international team was working on logistical arrangements to travel to China as soon as possible. 'We hope the team will be able to travel in January,' he said.

A Western diplomat said that the team was expected to leave in early January, ahead of WHO's executive board opening on January 18, adding: 'There is strong pressure on China and on WHO.'

Hamilton said a similar but not identical virus was identified in a horseshoe bat, indicating that it was transmitted first to an animal, or intermediate host, before infecting humans.

'When we are doing animal surveillance, it's difficult, it's rather like looking for a needle in a haystack,' he said.

Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO's top expert in animal diseases, said last month the mission would like to interview market workers about how they were infected with the virus.

'There is nothing to indicate that it would be man-made,' he added.

Chinese state media have suggested the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing its presence on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe last year.

Some Western countries have voiced concern at the delay in sending international experts.

One senior Western diplomat complained of a lack of transparency while experts were not on the ground talking to clinicians and researchers or inspecting lab samples.

But another Western diplomat said that the mission was on a 'good footing' and that the WHO had to accept China's terms to secure access.

Scientists initially believed the killer virus jumped from animals to humans at a market selling exotic animals for meat in the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected late last year.

But experts now think the market may not have been the origin of the outbreak, but rather a place where it was amplified.

Mr Macron, who joins Britain's Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump in a growing list of world leaders who have contracted Covid-19, will isolate for seven days but plans to continue running the country via video conference.

Prime Minister Johnson, who has not met Mr Macron face-to-face for months and been snubbed on Brexit negotiations, wished his 'friend' a swift recovery.

Frantic contact tracing is now afoot with the president having been centre stage in Brexit negotiations. Only yesterday, he was pictured embracing the Prime Minister of Portugal Antonio Costa in Paris.

Mr Costa is in self isolation, as is Mr Macron's wife Brigitte, 67, and Spain's PM Pedro Sanchez and President of the European Council Charles Michel who both met the French leader on Monday.

Mr Macron was also pictured shaking hands with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development chief Angel Gurria in the Elysee palace courtyard, and also embracing the 70-year-old, who has since gone into isolation.

This was despite Mr Macron Tweeting on July 12: 'You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!'

These 'barrier gestures' include avoiding handshakes, hugs and kisses, and on Thursday an aide to Mr Macron admitted that Mr Macron made an 'unfortunate' mistake in shaking Mr Gurria's hand, adding: 'There's no denying it.'

Jean Castex, France’s Prime Minister, said he would also self-isolate after coming into regular contact with his boss.

Political party chiefs from the Senate and France’s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, said they would do the same because they had a lunch with Mr Macron on Tuesday.

French government guidelines are for no more than six people to dine together during the pandemic, but there were as many as 20 people around Mr Macron’s table.

'We are going to defeat this pandemic together,' she said on Twitter. 'We will continue to work hand in hand to immunise and protect our citizens.'

Mr Macron joined dozens of other European leaders, including Ms von der Leyen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a summit in Brussels last Thursday and Friday.

Mrs Merkel has since tested negative for Covid, her office said today.

A key aspect of their talks was how to implement a Covid vaccine on the continent - the EU is lagging behind Britain because its central regulatory body must take into account all 27 member states - the bureaucrats have managed to cut down their expedited process of 210 days to fewer than 150.

Also dominating discussions was Brexit and Mr Macron was pictured having tête-à-têtes with President von der Leyen and Mrs Merkel.

He was also seen gesturing in the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's face while standing just a few yards from the Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Others in attendance included Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte and European Parliament President David Sassoli.

Tactile Mr Macron was frequently pictured touching counterparts at those discussions and on Wednesday the French President took the 59-year-old PM of Portugal Mr Costa in his arms on the steps of the Elysee Palace.

Mr Macron was also pictured welcoming dignitaries with fond clinches at the palace on Monday for a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

In attendance were European Council President Michel, Spanish PM Sanchez, UNESCO general director Audrey Azoulay and OECD chief Angel Gurria.

Today, Prime Ministers Sanchez and Costa, Commission President Michel, French PM Jean Castex and President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand all announced that they will be self-isolating.

None of them said that they had tested positive.

Mr Macron's wife Brigitte has gone into isolation for the second time - she quarantined in October after coming into contact with someone who tested positive.

As result of the diagnosis, a trip next week by Mr Macron to Lebanon - where the president had been pressing for far-reaching political change after the giant Beirut port explosion in August - has been cancelled.

France recorded more than 17,000 new cases on Wednesday - sparking concern as people shop and travel more ahead of the Christmas holidays

The virus has resurfaced in France - as across the rest of Europe - and there are grave fears that deaths could spike in the colder winter months

Mr Macron held the government's weekly Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and the day before had lunch with the heads of political groups at the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.

The virus has an incubation period of 14 days, meaning that anyone who came into contact with Mr Macron up to December 3 would be advised to either get tested or self-isolate.

A theory as to how Mr Macron may have caught the virus has not yet been advanced.

The French president is one of several heads of state and government around the world who have contracted Covid-19, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump.

France earlier this week eased restrictions imposed to battle the second wave of the coronavirus but infection rates remain high.

There is still a nationwide overnight curfew from 8 pm to halt the spread of the virus while restaurants and cafes as well as theatres and cinemas remain closed.

Over 59,300 people have died in France of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures.

The recording of over 17,000 new cases on Wednesday alone has also generated concern as people shop and travel more intensely ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.

'It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population', he added.

Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.",MailOnline,"['president', 'tests', 'hugging', 'mr', 'tested', 'portugals', 'prime', 'minister', 'wife', 'positive', 'macron', 'covid19', 'palace', 'day', 'french', 'selfisolating', 'european']",0
2020-12-17 02:08:03+00:00,66,"World Health Organisation (WHO) scientists will travel to Wuhan in January to investigate the origins of Covid-19 after months of negotiating with China for access.

The international mission is expected to go to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the virus that sparked the coronavirus pandemic, WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson confirmed.

A year into the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.6 million people and infected over 73 million globally, the question of where the virus came from and how it first crossed over to humans remains a mystery.

Pictured: Workers in protective suits walk past the Hankou railway station in Wuhan in China's Hubei province, April 2020. Wuhan is belieed to have been where the Covid-19 outbreak, that sparked the global pandemic, began. The first case was reported on December 31, 2019

The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the outbreak's extent, has called for a 'transparent' WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research.

China reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, central China, to the WHO on December 31 and closed a so called 'wet market' where the novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged.

Health ministers called on the WHO in May to identify the source of the virus and how it crossed the species barrier, and the UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the international probe.

But it has until now remained unclear when the larger team of scientists would be able to travel to China to begin epidemiological studies to try to identify the first human cases and their source of infection.

Now a team of 12-15 international experts is finally preparing to go to Wuhan to examine evidence, including human and animal samples collected by Chinese researchers, and to build on their initial studies.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member, said that the team would leave 'just after New Year's' for a six-week mission, including two weeks of quarantine on arrival.

'Phase 1 was supposed to be completed by now, according to the terms of reference, and we should have some results. If that's what we get when we come to China...that would be fantastic. Then we are already in phase 2,' she told Reuters.

Keith Hamilton, an expert at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) who will take part, told reporters on Tuesday: 'I anticipate the mission will take place quite soon.'

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an emailed reply to Reuters inquiry that the international team was working on logistical arrangements to travel to China as soon as possible. 'We hope the team will be able to travel in January,' he said.

A Western diplomat said that the team was expected to leave in early January, ahead of WHO's executive board opening on January 18, adding: 'There is strong pressure on China and on WHO.'

Hamilton said a similar but not identical virus was identified in a horseshoe bat, indicating that it was transmitted first to an animal, or intermediate host, before infecting humans.

'When we are doing animal surveillance, it's difficult, it's rather like looking for a needle in a haystack,' he said.

Chinese state media have suggested the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing its presence on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe last year.

Some Western countries have voiced concern at the delay in sending international experts.

One senior Western diplomat complained of a lack of transparency while experts were not on the ground talking to clinicians and researchers or inspecting lab samples.

But another Western diplomat said that the mission was on a 'good footing' and that the WHO had to accept China's terms to secure access.

Scientists initially believed the killer virus jumped from animals to humans at a market selling exotic animals for meat in the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected late last year.

But experts now think the market may not have been the origin of the outbreak, but rather a place where it was amplified.

2020-12-16 15:30:07+00:00,10,"Germany's daily death toll from coronavirus surged to a record 952 today as the country entered its toughest lockdown since the early weeks of the pandemic.

The new 'hard lockdown', replacing a six-week 'lockdown light' which failed to bring the second wave under control, will see shops and schools closed until January while social gatherings will be severely limited over the Christmas holidays.

Alcohol is banned in public places - putting a halt to traditional mulled wine stands at Christmas markets - while hairdressers and salons are also shutting down.

It comes with the infection rate rising to its highest levels yet, with nearly 28,000 new cases announced on Wednesday compared to 21,000 a week ago.

The record death toll - smashing the previous record of 598, although thought to include some delayed figures from Tuesday - takes the overall figure to 23,427.

Germany's infection rate has yet to be brought under control in the second wave, with a new surge in the last two weeks following a temporary stabilisation

The death rate has also continued to rise, far exceeding the numbers during the spring which were significantly lower than in the other major countries of Western Europe

A security guard closes the iron gate at Berlin's famous KaDeWe department store last night as it closes its doors during Germany's second national lockdown

Angela Merkel agreed the tough restrictions with state leaders on Sunday and has repeatedly sounded the alarm about the high infection rate.

Under Germany's federal system, the states have the final say, and some are adopting even tougher measures - with Saxony imposing a 10pm curfew and Bavaria enacting stay-at-home rules similar to those in other countries.

Schools stayed open during the 'lockdown light', but are moving to distance learning from Wednesday until at least January 10.

Companies in Europe's largest economy are also being encouraged to allow their employees to work from home during the month-long shutdown.

'That would help to implement the principle 'we're staying at home',' according to the policy paper agreed by Merkel and state premiers.

Social gatherings are restricted to five people from two households, although children aged under 14 are not counted towards the limit.

The rules are being slightly relaxed from December 24-26, when any one household can meet four other people - meaning the total number can rise above five.

However, there is no relaxation over the New Year, and traditional firework displays have been banned in public places.

Shops are also closing down for the first time since the spring, with only essential stores such as supermarkets allowed to remain open.

The typically cautious Merkel last week made an unusually impassioned appeal for Germans to keep their discipline over the Christmas period.

'If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we'd really have failed,' she said.

While Merkel remains largely popular, Germany's long-admired pandemic response has come under greater scrutiny as the death toll continues to climb.

Many European countries saw their infection rates fall after imposing new measures in October and November, but Germany has yet to see a significant drop.

After stabilising for a a few weeks, infections started to rise again at the start of December and the last week has seen a record of more than 160,000 cases.

Some parts of Germany, especially in the former East, which had escaped the first wave of the pandemic relatively lightly are now seeing a massive spread of Covid-19.

The death toll, which only once rose above 300 per day during the spring, is now at an average of almost 500.

Pariser Platz, the square in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, was deserted early this morning as the lockdown got underway

And while the German health system has generally handled the crisis well, the number of patients in intensive care is now at an all-time record of 4,735.

Merkel's economy minister Peter Altmaier and Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder have both described the virus situation as 'out of control' in Germany.

Soeder, seen as a possible contender for Merkel's job when she leaves office next year, warned this week that Germany could become the 'problem child' of Europe.

The one ray of hope for Germany was a prediction by health minister Jens Spahn that vaccinations could still begin before Christmas.

Spahn told German television that jabs with the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine could begin within two to four days of an approval by the European Medicines Agency.

The jab has already been approved in Britain, but Spahn has voiced impatience with EU regulators in recent days, finally receiving assurances that the EMA will finalise the approval process by December 23.

Germany has set up some 440 vaccination centres, has 10,000 doctors and medical staff ready and is ready to start mass vaccinations immediately, Spahn says.

2020-12-16 11:19:06+00:00,8,"Sweden's health experts misjudged the resurgence of Covid-19 and 'didn't see such a wave in front of them', prime minister Stefan Lofven has said.

Medical advisers 'talked about different clusters' but did not recommend tough measures to contain a second wave, which in fact has infected nearly 250,000 people in the autumn and winter, Lofven told the newspaper Aftonbladet.

The PM's comments came as Sweden's no-lockdown approach, championed by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, was blamed in part for the high death toll in care homes during the first wave.

A report by a special commission said the community spread of Covid-19 was likely the biggest factor behind the thousands of deaths, adding that Sweden's Nordic neighbours had paid more attention to elderly care during the pandemic.

Now, the unforeseen second wave has strained Sweden's healthcare system and forced the government to adopt its toughest restrictions to date, although it is still holding out against a full-scale lockdown.

Sweden's infection rate has yet to reach the peak of its second wave, a trend which PM Stefan Lofven says was not foreseen by the country's health advisers

The second-wave death rate has continued to climb in recent weeks, but has yet to reach the peak that was seen during the first wave

Tegnell had defended his strategy during the spring by arguing that lighter measures were more sustainable over the long term.

'If it looks like we're going to get a second wave in the fall with a lot of cases, we could easily continue doing what we're doing today,' he predicted in April.

In fact, Sweden has limited public gatherings to eight people and banned alcohol sales after 10pm during the second wave, though it is still dismissive of mask use.

There have also been signs of politicians such as Lofven taking a more prominent role at the expense of health officials such as Tegnell.

After cases and deaths reached their lowest levels at the start of September, the infection rate went surging up again during the autumn and has yet to come down.

The last week has seen a new record of more than 43,000 cases added to the tally, while another 467 people have died - taking the total to 7,667.

Around half of the total deaths are thought to have been residents in elderly care, the subject of the damning report published on Tuesday.

Sweden's prime minister Stefan Lofven, pictured, said health officials had misjudged the second wave of the pandemic

Sweden's eye-catching strategy of resisting full-scale lockdowns has been championed by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, pictured

Mats Melin, the inquiry head, said there were major structural shortcomings in elderly care in Sweden for which local authorities and previous governments were partly to blame.

'But we want to say that it is the government that rules the country and has the ultimate responsibility,' Melin told a news conference.

Despite official talk of 'ring-fencing' the elderly from Covid-19, the commission said that too little was done to protect the elderly during the first wave.

'The aspect of [the strategy] which centred on protecting the elderly failed. There is no other way to view the fact that so many died in Covid-19,' Melin said.

'The government should have taken steps to ensure the elderly care was better prepared for the pandemic.'

Employees in elderly care were 'largely left alone to handle the crisis situation', the commission said in its initial findings.

It also pointed to poorly educated staff and low levels of nurses and doctors in elderly care.

'In the other Nordic countries... care for the elderly seems to have been more in focus in the authorities' early pandemic measures,' the report said.

In November, Sweden's Health and Social Care Inspectorate said it had found 'serious shortcomings' in elderly care.

In only six per cent of cases reviewed were nursing home Covid-19 patients given a physical examination by a doctor, the inspectorate found.

PM Lofven has defended the country's overall strategy but admitted that Sweden failed to shield the elderly.

Sweden has suffered many times more deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, although fewer than some European countries that opted for lockdowns.

On Monday, Sweden's statistical agency said it had recorded a total of 8,088 deaths from all causes in November - the highest mortality ever reported in the Scandinavian country since the first year of the 1918-20.

2020-12-16 10:59:06+00:00,9,"Germany's daily death toll from coronavirus surged to a record 952 today as the country entered its toughest lockdown since the early weeks of the pandemic.

The new 'hard lockdown', replacing a six-week 'lockdown light' which failed to bring the second wave under control, will see shops and schools closed until January while social gatherings will be severely limited over the Christmas holidays.

Alcohol is banned in public places - putting a halt to traditional mulled wine stands at Christmas markets - while hairdressers and salons are also shutting down.

It comes with the infection rate rising to its highest levels yet, with nearly 28,000 new cases announced on Wednesday compared to 21,000 a week ago.

The record death toll - smashing the previous record of 598, although thought to include some delayed figures from Tuesday - takes the overall figure to 23,427.

Germany's infection rate has yet to be brought under control in the second wave, with a new surge in the last two weeks following a temporary stabilisation

The death rate has also continued to rise, far exceeding the numbers during the spring which were significantly lower than in the other major countries of Western Europe

Angela Merkel agreed the tough restrictions with state leaders on Sunday and has repeatedly sounded the alarm about the high infection rate.

Under Germany's federal system, the states have the final say, and some are adopting even tougher measures - with Saxony imposing a 10pm curfew and Bavaria enacting stay-at-home rules similar to those in other countries.

Schools stayed open during the 'lockdown light', but are moving to distance learning from Wednesday until at least January 10.

Companies in Europe's largest economy are also being encouraged to allow their employees to work from home during the month-long shutdown.

'That would help to implement the principle 'we're staying at home',' according to the policy paper agreed by Merkel and state premiers.

Social gatherings are restricted to five people from two households, although children aged under 14 are not counted towards the limit.

The rules are being slightly relaxed from December 24-26, when any one household can meet four other people - meaning the total number can rise above five.

However, there is no relaxation over the New Year, and traditional firework displays have been banned in public places.

Shops are also closing down for the first time since the spring, with only essential stores such as supermarkets allowed to remain open.

The typically cautious Merkel last week made an unusually impassioned appeal for Germans to keep their discipline over the Christmas period.

'If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we'd really have failed,' she said.

While Merkel remains largely popular, Germany's long-admired pandemic response has come under greater scrutiny as the death toll continues to climb.

Many European countries saw their infection rates fall after imposing new measures in October and November, but Germany has yet to see a significant drop.

After stabilising for a a few weeks, infections started to rise again at the start of December and the last week has seen a record of more than 160,000 cases.

Some parts of Germany, especially in the former East, which had escaped the first wave of the pandemic relatively lightly are now seeing a massive spread of Covid-19.

The death toll, which only once rose above 300 per day during the spring, is now at an average of almost 500.

Pariser Platz, the square in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, was deserted early this morning as the lockdown got underway

And while the German health system has generally handled the crisis well, the number of patients in intensive care is now at an all-time record of 4,735.

Merkel's economy minister Peter Altmaier and Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder have both described the virus situation as 'out of control' in Germany.

Soeder, seen as a possible contender for Merkel's job when she leaves office next year, warned this week that Germany could become the 'problem child' of Europe.

The one ray of hope for Germany was a prediction by health minister Jens Spahn that vaccinations could still begin before Christmas.

Spahn told German television that jabs with the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine could begin within two to four days of an approval by the European Medicines Agency.

The jab has already been approved in Britain, but Spahn has voiced impatience with EU regulators in recent days, finally receiving assurances that the EMA will finalise the approval process by December 23.

Germany has set up some 440 vaccination centres, has 10,000 doctors and medical staff ready and is ready to start mass vaccinations immediately, Spahn says.

2020-12-16 10:16:03+00:00,17,"Sweden's health experts misjudged the resurgence of Covid-19 and 'didn't see such a wave in front of them', prime minister Stefan Lofven has said.

Medical advisers 'talked about different clusters' but did not recommend tough measures to contain a second wave, which in fact has infected nearly 250,000 people in the autumn and winter, Lofven told the newspaper Aftonbladet.

The PM's comments came as Sweden's no-lockdown approach, championed by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, was blamed in part for the high death toll in care homes during the first wave.

A report by a special commission said the community spread of Covid-19 was likely the biggest factor behind the thousands of deaths, adding that Sweden's Nordic neighbours had paid more attention to elderly care during the pandemic.

Now, the unforeseen second wave has strained Sweden's healthcare system and forced the government to adopt its toughest restrictions to date, although it is still holding out against a full-scale lockdown.

Sweden's infection rate has yet to reach the peak of its second wave, a trend which PM Stefan Lofven says was not foreseen by the country's health advisers

The second-wave death rate has continued to climb in recent weeks, but has yet to reach the peak that was seen during the first wave

Tegnell had defended his strategy during the spring by arguing that lighter measures were more sustainable over the long term.

'If it looks like we're going to get a second wave in the fall with a lot of cases, we could easily continue doing what we're doing today,' he predicted in April.

In fact, Sweden has limited public gatherings to eight people and banned alcohol sales after 10pm during the second wave, though it is still dismissive of mask use.

There have also been signs of politicians such as Lofven taking a more prominent role at the expense of health officials such as Tegnell.

After cases and deaths reached their lowest levels at the start of September, the infection rate went surging up again during the autumn and has yet to come down.

The last week has seen a new record of more than 43,000 cases added to the tally, while another 467 people have died - taking the total to 7,667.

Around half of the total deaths are thought to have been residents in elderly care, the subject of the damning report published on Tuesday.

Mats Melin, the inquiry head, said there were major structural shortcomings in elderly care in Sweden for which local authorities and previous governments were partly to blame.

'But we want to say that it is the government that rules the country and has the ultimate responsibility,' Melin told a news conference.

Despite official talk of 'ring-fencing' the elderly from Covid-19, the commission said that too little was done to protect the elderly during the first wave.

'The aspect of [the strategy] which centred on protecting the elderly failed. There is no other way to view the fact that so many died in Covid-19,' Melin said.

'The government should have taken steps to ensure the elderly care was better prepared for the pandemic.'

2020-12-16 07:54:03+00:00,34,"Covid-19 restrictions have squeezed civil liberties worldwide with authoritarian regimes exploiting the restrictions as a way to shore up their control of fast-changing societies, rights groups say.

Demonstrations have been outlawed, elections postponed, and activists subject to even greater repression in a health emergency whose political impact will still be felt when the pandemic is over.

In China, where the virus first emerged but has now largely been held in check, the authorities have adopted extremely coercive measures, with strict lockdowns of very large areas, massive screening and surveillance by drones.

In Guinea, the government has banned all demonstrations until further notice, citing the fight against Covid. Hungary is under a state of emergency until February, while in Nigeria, a crackdown on protests against restrictions left several dead.

Bolivia postponed its general elections for several months, and in France, citizens had to fill out a form before being allowed to leave their homes during two lockdowns that lasted over three months in total.

Chinese guards wearing masks line up in Beijing earlier this year as authorities in the world's most populous country took draconian measures to curb the coronavirus

According to the Sweden-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), 61 per cent of countries have implemented measures to curb Covid-19 'that were concerning from a democracy and human rights perspective.'

'These violated democratic standards because they were either disproportionate, illegal, indefinite or unnecessary in relation to the health threat,' it said in a report.

IDEA said that while such troubling developments were less common in democracies they were 'still quite widespread.'.

UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet has also warned that while many states had adopted justifiable and temporary measures 'there have also been deeply worrying cases where governments appear to be using Covid-19 as a cover for human rights violations.'

Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders said in a report on 2020 that emergency measures adopted to tackle the pandemic 'visibly contributed to a news and information lockdown' and resulted in journalists being detained or jailed.

According to US NGO Freedom House, 'the condition of democracy and human rights has grown worse in 80 countries' since the pandemic began.

In Sri Lanka, the government 'accelerated its authoritarian agenda... stepping up efforts to control independent reporting and unfavourable speech by ordering the arrest of anyone who criticises or contradicts the official line' on Covid, it said.

'We've seen in the last few months the President consolidating power,' said Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives think-tank in Colombo, decrying a 'weakening of checks and balances.'

In Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is accused by activists of leading an authoritarian regime that has locked up tens of thousands of opponents, the pandemic was a chance to further squeeze liberties.

The pandemic 'merely offered the president a new guise within which to pass and enact oppressive legislation that either further entrenches preexisting practices already or introduces new, harsher conditions upon ordinary citizens,' researcher Hafsa Halawa said in a joint report by the Atlantic Council and ISPI think tanks.

A report by the European Council on Foreign Relations, (ECFR) sounded alarm over the response of states of the former Yugoslavia in the western Balkans.

Governments there have often taken 'selective and arbitrary approaches to applying restrictions' and sometimes used 'these measures to silence their critics and opponents,' it said.

In France, people had to fill out paperwork to leave their homes during two lockdowns this year (pictured, pedestrians showing their forms to police in Nice)

But the impact on freedoms is not confined to autocratic regimes. It is also felt in liberal democracies, albeit in a less blatant form.

The restrictions imposed for much of this year would have been unthinkable to most Europeans even in January.

'Emergency powers carry a risk of abuse of power by the executive' and of remaining in force even once the emergency is over, meaning 'appropriate parliamentary and judicial oversight' is required to limit the risk, the EU parliament said in November.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has argued 'the voluntary creation of a permanent state of emergency - even if it is not declared in the technical sense - has become one of the essential practices of contemporary states, including those that are supposedly democratic.'

The health emergency declared in France to fight the pandemic can be compared to the state of emergency imposed in the wake of a terror attack, said Laureline Fontaine, professor in public law at Sorbonne Nouvelle university.

'We have become used to living without freedom,' she said.

Even once vaccines or other factors manage to quell the spread of the virus, the economic fallout from the pandemic risks fuelling discontent which in turn may prompt more restrictions.

It is 'no surprise' that in Russia frustration with President Vladimir Putin's rule is growing as the economic consequences of the pandemic compound a decade of stagnation.

'The second- and third-order consequences of the disruptions and dislocations wrought by the pandemic may be dramatic,' Andrei Kolesnikov and Denis Volkov argued in a study for the Carnegie Moscow Center.

In the Middle East, the poor response by state authorities to the pandemic and the strengthening of authoritarian practices 'is most likely to amplify dynamics and reasons for discontent,' the Atlantic Council and ISPI warned in their report.

2020-12-14 15:00:05+00:00,6,"The drug remdesivir, long touted as a potential Covid-19 treatment, has been used to successfully cure a patient who suffered a rare reaction to the disease.

A 31-year-old man infected with the coronavirus experienced unusual symptoms due to a genetic disorder called XLA, which prevented him from making antibodies to fight infection.

The patient was twice admitted to hospital with confirmed Covid-19, with moderate but persistent symptoms. His condition was stable but did not improve on its own.

On both occasions, treatment with remdesivir rapidly led to improvement in his condition and allowed him to be discharged.

The researchers say the patient's inability to make antibodies offered a unique insight into the functioning of the drug in Covid-19 patients.

Writing in Nature Communications they say remdesevir likely has antiviral properties and could be highly effective for some patients.

Remdesivir was initially developed to treat hepatitis C and then repurposed as a potential Ebola treatment, Due to the similarity in the structures of these viruses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, experts hoped it may be able to help fight the current pandemic

US BOUGHT ALMOST ENTIRE GLOBAL SUPPLY OF REMDESIVIR IN JUNE Boris Johnson was forced in July allay fears of an anti-coronavirus drugs shortage today after Donald Trump bought up almost the entire global supply of remdesivir. The US president was accused of 'undermining' the global coronavirus fight by splashing the cash on one of only two drugs approved to treat Covid-19 at the time. UK business minister Nadhim Zahawi was among those who criticised his decision to make the rest of the world compete for the medication, originally designed to treat Ebola but proven to speed up recovery time for coronavirus patients. But Downing Street and the Department of Health later played down the significance of the move, insisting that the UK has enough of a stockpile to treat everyone who needs it. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said on July 1: 'The UK currently has a sufficient stock of Remdesivir.' And the Department of Health said it had secured supplies in advance and had enough to treat every NHS patient who needs it. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) had earlier revealed it had secured more than 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir for American hospitals. It represents the entire global supply for July and 90 per cent of stocks for August and September, leading to fears of an autumn shortage. Discussing the deal — which US health chiefs boasted was 'amazing' — Mr Zahawi told Sky News: 'It's much better to work together than to work to undermine each other, so we'll continue in that spirit.'

Remdesivir was initially developed to treat hepatitis C and then repurposed as a potential Ebola treatment.

Due to the similarity in the structures of these viruses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, experts hoped it may be able to help fight the current pandemic.

There is no consensus as to whether it is effective however, with clinical trials showing mixed results.

The NHS has approved it for use on Covid-19 patients in the hope it can help, but are already being forced to ration the drug, which costs £2,400 per course ($3,120).

But in November, the World Health Organization (WHO), said doctors should not treat coronavirus patients with remdesivir 'regardless of how ill they are'.

Officials at the time said there is 'no evidence' it boosts people's chances of surviving the disease or stops them falling ill enough to need mechanical ventilation'.

They also warned there is the 'possibility of important harm' when using the experimental Ebola drug - as it can cause kidney and liver damage in some patients.

However, Dr James Thaventhiran from the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Cambridge, said: 'There have been different studies supporting or questioning remdesivir's effectiveness, but some of those conducted during the first wave of infection may not be optimal for assessing its antiviral properties.

'Mortality is due to a combination of factors, likely including unchecked viral replication and, importantly, the response of the immune system.

'A clinical trial that looks only at remdesivir's impact on mortality will have difficulty distinguishing between these two factors. This limits our ability to ask the simple question: how good is remdesivir as an antiviral?'

An antiviral is a chemical which actively destroys the virus.

The individual case of the 31-year-old patient provided the perfect opportunity for researchers to assess the antiviral properties of the drug.

His genetic condition prevented him from making enough antibodies to fight off the disease and therefore when the course of his disease plateaued, neither improving or worsening over time, the virus and its host were stuck in a form of grim homeostasis.

However, his inability to manufacture antibodies may well have saved his life because in severe cases of Covid-19, where patients are admitted to ICU and intubated for example, the virus levels are often low.

At this point in disease, the patient's immune system has started to malfunction and sent into overdrive.

The goal of this is to destroy the virus, but once it gets out of hand, the immune response attacks the body itself, causing inflammation.

In Covid-19 patients this is known as the 'cytokine storm' and can be fatal. The absence of such an immune response in the patient from Cambridge means this never happened.

As a result, the disease manifested itself as prolonged, moderate symptoms that, when untreated, did not improve or significantly worsen.

He initially suffered with fever, cough, nausea and vomiting and tested positive for the coronavirus on day 19 of symptoms.

The symptoms persisted and on day 30 he was admitted to hospital, where he was given supplemental oxygen due to breathing difficulties.

Unusually, his fever and inflammation of the lungs persisted for longer than 30 days, but without causing severe breathing problems or spreading to other organs.

The researchers say this may have been due to his inability to produce antibodies.

WHAT IS REMDESIVIR AND DOES IT WORK AGAINST CORONAVIRUS? Remdesivir, an anti-viral drug first made to try and treat Ebola, has been used experimentally on Covid-19 patients since the outbreak's early days. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the drug on May 1, in response to the preliminary results of a notable study that was released at the end of April. It was also given the green-light for use on the NHS in Britain at the same time. There are claims of miraculous recovery, improved survival odds and shorter illness, but other studies have found it makes no difference to patients in hospital with Covid-19. Remdesivir produced encouraging results earlier this year when it showed promise for both preventing and treating MERS - another coronavirus - in macaque monkeys. The drug appears to help stop the replication of viruses like coronavirus and Ebola alike. It's not entirely clear how the drug accomplishes this feat, but it seems to stop the genetic material of the virus, RNA, from being able to copy itself. That, in turn, stops the virus from being able to proliferate further inside the patient's body. Advertisement

He was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — two drugs which early in the pandemic had been suggested as potential treatments — which were ineffective.

Hydroxychloroquine is the anti-malaria drug which Donald Trump championed but has now been widely disregarded as a treatment. Azithromycin a commonly used antibiotic, is still being tested as part of the world-leading RECOVERY trial.

This treatment was halted on day 34 and he them was given a course of remdesevir. The upturn in his condition was rapid, and after just 36 hours the fever had improved, as too had the shortness of breath.

His nausea and vomiting also stopped and he was soon taken off supplemental oxygen.

Further observations revealed inflammation was declining, his immune system was recovering and the damage in the lungs was clearing.

On day 43 of his illness, he was discharged from hospital but a week later his symptoms returned and he tested positive and was readmitted to hospital on day 54.

The improvement seen previously had been wiped out and he was then given a ten-day course of remdesivir.

His condition again improved and he was discharged less than two weeks after starting his second bout of remdesivir treatment.

Researchers found that as his condition improved over both periods of treatment, the levels of virus in his system declined.

This, the researchers believe, is evidence that his XLA prevented him from fighting the virus himself as he does not produce antibodies.

Dr Nicholas Matheson from the University of Cambridge added: 'Our patient's unusual condition gave us a rare insight into the effectiveness of remdesivir as a treatment for coronavirus infection.

'The dramatic response to the drug – on repeated challenge – suggests that it can be a highly effective treatment, at least for some patients.'",MailOnline,"['treat', 'patients', 'drug', 'condition', 'beneficial', 'treatment', 'reveal', 'virus', 'doctors', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'ebola', 'remdesivir']",0

Ambrose Dlamini, 52, tested positive for the disease in mid-November but was said to be feeling well and was asymptomatic.

But his condition deteriorated and he was taken from the tiny landlocked nation to a hospital in neighbouring South Africa.

'Their Majesties have commanded that I inform the nation of the sad and untimely passing away of His Excellency the Prime Minister Ambrose Mandvulo Dlamini,' Deputy Prime Minister Themba Masuku said.

The prime minister 'passed on this afternoon while under medical care in a hospital in South Africa,' he added.

Born in Mbekelweni in 1968, Dlamini was great grandson of Prince Malunge, uncle to the country's longest-reigning monarch King Sobhuza II.

The married father-of-three studied at Hampton University in Virginia in the US before working in the banking industry for more than 18 years.

He was the managing director of Eswatini Nedbank Limited before being appointed as prime minister in November 2018.

He had no previous experience in government and was the youngest PM in the country's history.

The head of government's role is limited in Swaziland where King Mswati III, in power since 1986, names all ministers and controls parliament.

2020-12-14 11:57:51+00:00,0,"Covid-19 has forced Japan to close a New Year's Eve celebration on Mount Takao where crowds gather to watch the sunrise each year.

The event draws up to 2,000 hikers to the 2,000ft mountain, around an hour's journey from the capital.

But it has been cancelled for the first time in history over fears that it will spread coronavirus as visitors pack together and drink booze.

Tokyo officials said they will close the Omiharashi-Enchi lookout at the summit between 5pm on December 31 and 7am on January 1, national broadcaster NHK reported.

They deemed that the large numbers, as well as the likelihood that people would be drinking alcohol and sleeping overnight on Takao was too risky.

They said that visitors will, however, still be able to walk up to Yakuoin Buddhist temple.

The closure of the summit comes as Japan's Prime Minister urged citizens to reconsider their travel plans over the holidays.

Yoshihide Suga on Monday also pledged more support for medical workers and institutions overwhelmed by the country's third wave of cases, and promised expanded subsidies for restaurants and other struggling businesses.

Suga, who took office in September, has seen his approval ratings plunge in recent weeks in part over his handling of the new wave of cases and his refusal to heed calls to halt a controversial tourism travel campaign, Go To.

But on Monday night he reversed course under increasing pressure, including from medical advisers to the government.

Suga said: 'We have decided to take strongest steps possible in order to stop the spread of the infections... so that all of you can welcome the New Year in peace and quiet.'

He said the travel subsidy programme would be suspended between December 28 and January 11, with the halt coming into effect earlier for hardest-hit areas, including the capital Tokyo.

He also urged the public to reconsider plans to visit relatives during the holiday season.

'I ask (the public) to carefully reconsider travel plans to return to home towns. I ask for your help so that all of us can spend a calm and quiet New Year,' he said.

The call came as Japan sees rising infections - standing around 3,000 new cases per day - with doctors and nurses warning they are overwhelmed.

A poll by NHK found 81 percent of respondents had no plans to travel or visit their parents during the new year period, traditionally a busy travel time in Japan.

Japan has been less hard-hit than many countries - with 177,960 infections and 2,584 deaths recorded since the first case in January - and has avoided the strict lockdowns seen elsewhere.

With cases falling over the summer, the government launched campaigns to encourage travel and eating out, but these have been under fire as infections have risen, hitting daily records.

2020-12-14 11:20:07+00:00,7,"The drug remdesivir, long touted as a potential Covid-19 treatment, has been used to successfully cure a patient who suffered a rare reaction to the disease.

A 31-year-old man infected with the coronavirus experienced unusual symptoms due to a genetic disorder called XLA, which prevented him from making antibodies to fight infection.

The patient was twice admitted to hospital with confirmed Covid-19, with moderate but persistent symptoms. His condition was stable but did not improve on its own.

On both occasions, treatment with remdesivir rapidly led to improvement in his condition and allowed him to be discharged.

The researchers say the patient's inability to make antibodies offered a unique insight into the functioning of the drug in Covid-19 patients.

Writing in Nature Communications they say remdesevir likely has antiviral properties and could be highly effective for some patients.

Remdesivir was initially developed to treat hepatitis C and then repurposed as a potential Ebola treatment, Due to the similarity in the structures of these viruses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, experts hoped it may be able to help fight the current pandemic

US BOUGHT ALMOST ENTIRE GLOBAL SUPPLY OF REMDESIVIR IN JUNE Boris Johnson was forced in July allay fears of an anti-coronavirus drugs shortage today after Donald Trump bought up almost the entire global supply of remdesivir. The US president was accused of 'undermining' the global coronavirus fight by splashing the cash on one of only two drugs approved to treat Covid-19 at the time. UK business minister Nadhim Zahawi was among those who criticised his decision to make the rest of the world compete for the medication, originally designed to treat Ebola but proven to speed up recovery time for coronavirus patients. But Downing Street and the Department of Health later played down the significance of the move, insisting that the UK has enough of a stockpile to treat everyone who needs it. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said on July 1: 'The UK currently has a sufficient stock of Remdesivir.' And the Department of Health said it had secured supplies in advance and had enough to treat every NHS patient who needs it. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) had earlier revealed it had secured more than 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir for American hospitals. It represents the entire global supply for July and 90 per cent of stocks for August and September, leading to fears of an autumn shortage. Discussing the deal — which US health chiefs boasted was 'amazing' — Mr Zahawi told Sky News: 'It's much better to work together than to work to undermine each other, so we'll continue in that spirit.'

Remdesivir was initially developed to treat hepatitis C and then repurposed as a potential Ebola treatment.

Due to the similarity in the structures of these viruses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, experts hoped it may be able to help fight the current pandemic.

There is no consensus as to whether it is effective however, with clinical trials showing mixed results.

The NHS has approved it for use on Covid-19 patients in the hope it can help, but are already being forced to ration the drug, which costs £2,400 per course ($3,120).

But in November, the World Health Organization (WHO), said doctors should not treat coronavirus patients with remdesivir 'regardless of how ill they are'.

Officials at the time said there is 'no evidence' it boosts people's chances of surviving the disease or stops them falling ill enough to need mechanical ventilation'.

They also warned there is the 'possibility of important harm' when using the experimental Ebola drug - as it can cause kidney and liver damage in some patients.

However, Dr James Thaventhiran from the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Cambridge, said: 'There have been different studies supporting or questioning remdesivir's effectiveness, but some of those conducted during the first wave of infection may not be optimal for assessing its antiviral properties.

Researchers from the National Veterinary School of Alfort, France, recruited six dogs previously trained to sniff out other things and re-trained them to detect Covid-19.

Because of their famously acute sense of smell, dogs have been used to root out drugs, explosives and even successfully pick up diseases like colon cancer.

A team of French scientists have now shown man's best friend can also help save lives during the pandemic by spotting the virus 75 to 100 per cent of the time.

A number of pilot schemes involving the dogs have been trialled around the world, including in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Finland and Australia.

Travellers may already have seen the specially trained dogs at some airports, but the researchers are still trying to prove without a doubt that dogs can pick up the scent before the method is fully adopted and rolled out internationally.

The team behind the study hope their findings will mean dogs could be used in parts of the world without the infrastructure for expensive mass testing.

A team of French scientists have now shown man's best friend can also help save lives during the pandemic by spotting the virus 75 to 100 per cent of the time.

But the animals could be used anywhere, with hopes that invasive nasal swabs could be replaced by a sweat sample taken from the armpit for a dog to sniff, experts said.

Professor Dominique Grandjean, study author, said the dogs could check a large number of people in a short space of time, adding the 'results are good.'

'It is a success technically and scientifically and it's surprising because we didn't know what we were going to have as results,' Grandjean said.

The World Health Organisation has validated and part funded the dog trials, with the UAE the most advanced in terms of rollout of Covid-sniffing dogs.

They have dogs in three international airports and are deploying some mobile units to go to the villages and to the people that might be more exposed to the virus.

'For us the idea was, of course, the airports but I can imagine a small city having a couple of dogs and saying to the population 'you can be tested whenever you want'

''You just come and put a swab under your armpit and give that to the dog and he will tell you yes or no,' explained Grandjean.

'The dogs would be able to do that very quickly on a large number of people.'

Dogs could also be used where people are reluctant to have uncomfortable nasal swab tests, according to the French researchers.

During the study, started in March, the team recruited six dogs previously trained to sniff out bombs, colon cancer, or were used in search and rescue missions.

They then collected sweat samples from 177 people - 95 with Covid-19 and 82 without - and then placed the samples inside cones for the dogs to sniff.

In trials, the dogs were often able to pick out the infected sweat when they were part of a line-up of mock and negative samples.

They have also issued a 'practical guide' to other academics to help others in their research and are building up a set of 'international training standards' for dogs.

Public toilets are thought to be one of the riskiest places to catch COVID-19.

A South Korean woman was likely infected with the disease when she used an aeroplane toilet during a flight from virus-hit Italy earlier this year, researchers wrote in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The 28-year-old was among about 300 South Koreans who were evacuated from Milan, Italy, on March 31 - amid the pandemic's height in Europe, the team from Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, claimed.

It is said the woman wore an N95 mask for the duration of the flight, except when she went to use the toilet.

At least one person who had COVID-19 - but was asymptomatic at the time - also used the restroom, making it likely that the 28-year-old breathed in infectious droplets or touched a contaminated surface.

2020-12-10 22:21:03+00:00,20,"Dogs can be trained to detect people infected with coronavirus by sniffing their armpits, study finds, and they are already being used in airports around the world.

Researchers from the National Veterinary School of Alfort, France, recruited six dogs previously trained to sniff out other things and re-trained them to detect Covid-19.

Because of their famously acute sense of smell, dogs have been used to root out drugs, explosives and even successfully pick up diseases like colon cancer.

A team of French scientists have now shown man's best friend can also help save lives during the pandemic by spotting the virus 75 to 100 per cent of the time.

A number of pilot schemes involving the dogs have been trialled around the world, including in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Finland and Australia.

Travellers may already have seen the specially trained dogs at some airports, but the researchers are still trying to prove without a doubt that dogs can pick up the scent before the method is fully adopted and rolled out internationally.

The team behind the study hope their findings will mean dogs could be used in parts of the world without the infrastructure for expensive mass testing.

A team of French scientists have now shown man's best friend can also help save lives during the pandemic by spotting the virus 75 to 100 per cent of the time.

But the animals could be used anywhere, with hopes that invasive nasal swabs could be replaced by a sweat sample taken from the armpit for a dog to sniff, experts said.

Professor Dominique Grandjean, study author, said the dogs could check a large number of people in a short space of time, adding the 'results are good.'

'It is a success technically and scientifically and it's surprising because we didn't know what we were going to have as results,' Grandjean said.

The World Health Organisation has validated and part funded the dog trials, with the UAE the most advanced in terms of rollout of Covid-sniffing dogs.

They have dogs in three international airports and are deploying some mobile units to go to the villages and to the people that might be more exposed to the virus.

'For us the idea was, of course, the airports but I can imagine a small city having a couple of dogs and saying to the population 'you can be tested whenever you want'

''You just come and put a swab under your armpit and give that to the dog and he will tell you yes or no,' explained Grandjean.

'The dogs would be able to do that very quickly on a large number of people.'

A four-year-old boy in Italy was infected with coronavirus as early as November 2019, it is believed, in the latest piece of evidence that the disease was spreading around the world well before China acknowledged the outbreak.

The child, who lived near Milan and had not been travelling abroad, came down with a cough on November 21 last year and was taken to a hospital's emergency wing days later.

On December 5, 2019, a swab was taken from his throat, and that specimen has since tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.

But the virus went undetected in Italy until late January, only weeks before the contagion spiralled into Europe's first major outbreak.

China has long been accused of covering up the epidemic in its early stages, thereby denying other countries time to prepare for the onslaught of infections.

Italy brought its infection and death rates down over the summer but they have since surged back to alarming levels

The latest discovery comes three weeks after a study by Italy's National Cancer Institute which suggested the virus was spreading as early as September 2019.

Researchers found that dozens of volunteers involved in a trial from September until March had developed antibodies against Covid-19 well before February.

Another test found that at least four people already had antibodies by the first week of October, suggesting they might have picked up the virus in September.

The new study suggests that a four-year-old boy who developed a cough on November 21 may also have been infected.

Nine days after first falling ill, the boy was 'was taken to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and vomiting', the study says.

On December 1, he developed a measles-like rash, and it was assumed at the time that measles were the cause of his illness.

This meant that the swab taken on December 5 was 'not optimal' for detecting Covid-19 because it was taken from the boy's throat rather than his nose.

However, the sample was 'confirmed as positive by repeated amplification and sequencing', the scientists said.

Writing in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers say their findings were 'in agreement with other evidence of early Covid-19 spread in Europe'.

The study said that a 'long-term, unrecognised spread' of the virus might help explain why the outbreak was so devastating to Italy in February and March.

Other studies have suggested that the virus was already present in France, Brazil and the United States before the end of 2019.

In May, French scientists said they had found evidence that a man was infected as early as December 27, having thought he had the flu.

The 42-year-old had no known links to China, suggesting that 'the disease was already spreading among the French population', researchers said.

However, it was not until December 31 that the WHO's China office was informed of a mystery pneumonia which had sickened 44 people in Wuhan.

On January 5, the WHO was still saying that there was 'no evidence of significant human-to-human transmission' of the virus.

China has always denied allegations of a cover-up, reacting angrily to calls for an international investigation into the origins of the virus, but there have been persistent doubts about the accuracy of the figures it releases.

Numerous reports have detailed how China withheld key details about the virus in its early stages, including from the WHO which has praised China in public.

A young doctor, Li Wenliang, was reprimanded by police after trying to raise the alarm about the disease - and later died of it.

The virus was first confirmed to have spread outside China in January, when a 61-year-old woman was found to be infected with it in Thailand.

Italy confirmed its first cases on January 30, when prime minister Giuseppe Conte said two Chinese tourists had tested positive for the disease.

Mattia Maestri was Italy's first known case of domestic transmission of coronavirus. He was diagnosed on February 21, and had not been to China or been in contact with a known case

The findings suggest that the virus was spreading in Italy months before Europe's first major outbreak began, forcing a national lockdown (pictured, a soldier stands guard in Milan)

In the following weeks, Italy became the first country in Europe to pile up hundreds of infections a day, followed by hundreds of deaths, mostly in the wealthy north.

Mattia Maestri, Italy's first known case of domestic transmission of coronavirus, was diagnosed on February 21, and had not been to China or been in contact with a known case.

In March alone, there were more than 12,000 deaths in Italy, and the country had the world's largest death toll for a time until the United States surpassed it in April.

Italy was the first Western nation to go into a full-scale lockdown, followed within a few weeks by most of Europe and the United States.

The drastic measures brought the infection rate under control by the summer, but Italy has again suffered badly during the second wave.

After daily deaths fell as low as five in the middle of August, they have once again surged into the hundreds, reaching a new record of 993 last Thursday.

2020-12-09 11:10:07+00:00,11,"Angela Merkel today demanded tougher restrictions to bring down coronavirus infections as Germany's death toll reached a grim daily record of nearly 600.

After months of relative success against the pandemic, Germany has seen its infection rate stubbornly refuse to come down in recent weeks, meaning that deaths are continuing to pile up.

Today's new high of 590 deaths took the total to 19,932 - more than double what it was at the start of the second wave - while another 20,815 cases marked a rise in the infection rate, a month after Germany entered a so-called 'lockdown light'.

Shops and schools have remained open until now, but Merkel is backing scientific advice calling for this to change over Christmas and New Year.

'When mulled wine stands are being built, when waffle stands are being built, that's not compatible with what we had agreed of only takeaways for food and drinks,' Merkel told parliament, referring to traditional German Christmas markets.

'I am really sorry... but if we're paying the price of death tolls at 590 people daily then that's, in my view, not acceptable.'

Coronavirus cases have stubbornly refused to come down in Germany - in contrast with many of its neighbours - and the infection rate has even resumed an upward trend in recent days

Deaths have soared way above the peak of the first wave, when Germany was seen as one of the most successful countries in dealing with the pandemic

Under Germany's federal system, the power to impose restrictions lies with regional governments. But Merkel has long pushed for harsher lockdown measures, which some state leaders, especially those in less affected regions, have resisted.

Pointing to scientific recommendations published on Tuesday, Merkel said she agreed that it was right to close shops and limit social gatherings.

The scientists at the Leopoldina Academy had called for non-essential shops to close between Christmas Eve and January 10 at the earliest.

Employees should also work from home when possible while schools should also kept shut, according to the scientific advice.

Merkel said schools should extend holidays until January 10 or offer online lessons until then, after the scientists said the Christmas holidays should start earlier.

The idea is to use the festive period to keep people at home and break the chain of infections.

Urging Germans to heed the experts' call, Merkel said people could not pick and choose when to accept the science.

'Because the numbers are what they are, we must do something about them,' she added.

Angela Merkel, pictured speaking to the German parliament today, has demanded tougher measures but it is up to regional governments to decide

With an eye on Christmas when families are expected to gather, Merkel said people have a responsibility to significantly reduce social contact.

'If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we'd really have failed,' she said.

Merkel's government has repeatedly said that numbers need to be brought down to 50 per 100,000 people but the rate is currently 149 per 100,000.

State leaders had agreed a plan to allow social contact restrictions to be eased over Christmas and New Year - allowing up to 10 adults to meet rather than just five.

However, harder-hit states including Berlin and Thuringia have opted to keep the tougher rules.

Saxony, meanwhile, has ordered schools, kindergartens and most shops to close from Monday after becoming the country's virus hotspot.

Merkel warned that the pandemic was 'reordering' the global economy, with European countries suffering a more serious economic hit from the virus than many others, especially in Asia.

But she defended Germany's approach against critics who said authorities should have been more aggressive in policing lockdowns.

Germany's relatively liberal approach was bound to be different from that of countries that 'look more like dictatorships', said the East German-born leader.",MailOnline,"['rate', 'merkel', 'schools', 'social', 'germany', 'christmas', 'scientific', 'restrictions', 'covid19', 'demands', 'shops', 'tougher']",0

Researchers used computer models to visualise the spread of droplets around a face shield ejected by a human sneeze from 3ft (1m) away.

It reveals 'vortex rings' produced by the sneeze carry infectious particles to the face shield in less than a second and stick to the edges of the plastic.

Researchers say if the timing of this wave of coronavirus particles coincides with the face shield wearer breathing in, the person can become infected.

Previous research has found the shields are also useless at trapping aerosols, indicating an infected person wearing one can still spread the virus.

Face masks DO make it harder to talk to people Wearing a face mask has a negative impact on our ability to communicate with others, according to a new survey. Research from the University of Manchester found wearing a covering makes lip-reading impossible; obscures a lot of non-verbal communication, such as facial expressions; and muffles sound. A total of 460 people were quizzed and 46 per cent said wearing a mask did alter communication, with a further 25 per cent saying it may have done. The impact of wearing a mask on communication is worse for people with hearing problems, the study warns, and can lead to anxiety, stress and embarrassment. Transparent face coverings are a potential solution, the researchers say, but current versions pose their own issues as they block more sound and steam up. Advertisement

Many people have opted for the face shields in preference to masks as they are less restrictive and claustrophobic.

They also allow people to see a person's mouth, which assists with lip-reading and non-verbal communication and is beneficial for people who are hard of hearing.

Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic they became popular with many groups, including beauticians and hairdressers.

In August, SAGE warned hairdressers and barbers should wear face coverings and not just visors in order to help curb the spread of coronavirus.

In order to welcome back clients in July, hairdressers, barbers, nail technicians and tattooists were told by the government that clear visors would be adequate enough to protect against Covid-19. It is not clear what this guidance was based on.

SAGE said face shields are 'likely' to protect the wearer against large droplets — the most common route of Covid-19 transmission — but there is no hard proof that this is the case.

Similarly, there is no evidence — and it is 'unlikely' — that face shields are an effective control against aerosol transmission.

A separate scientific paper published in July also found face shields are not protective against Covid-19 — but masks are.

Swiss officials investigated an outbreak of 'several' coronavirus cases that occurred at a hotel in a village in the Alps — even though employers took precautions.

Experts revealed only those who wore plastic visors were infected. But no-one who wore a mask, either alone or in addition to a face shield, caught the coronavirus, according to the study.

Researchers have previously found shields allow nearly 100 per cent of tiny airborne droplets released by coronavirus-infected patients to escape through visors.

A Japanese computer simulation revealed almost all airborne droplets smaller than five micrometres in size — released when talking and breathing — escaped through the visor.

And half of larger droplets measuring 50 micrometres in size — given off by coughs and sneezes — found their way into the air, posing a risk to others.

'No evidence' face shields protect against Covid-19 Hairdressers and barbers should wear face coverings and not just visors in order to help curb the spread of coronavirus, scientists advising the Government said in August. The experts warn that plastic face shields being used in hair salons are unlikely to be an effective control for aerosol transmission of Covid-19 - which scientists fear is one way the disease spreads. The revelation came via a batch of documents released by SAGE and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) says the guidance needs to change. Another study from Switzerland also found the plastic face shields do not work to stop the spread of coronavirus particles. Advertisement

The latest study by researchers at Fukuoka University in Japan and published in the journal Physics of Fluids further adds to the growing pile of proof against the use of face shields.

An alarming video published alongside the study illustrates how air flow from a sneeze can make its way around and up the inside of a face shield and into a person's mouth or nose, rendering the PPE useless without a face mask being worn as well.

Researchers looked specifically at sneezes because of the creation of a phenomena known as vortex rings.

'A vortex ring is a donut-shaped vortex that is generated by an instantaneous ejection of fluid from a circular orifice,' said study author Dr Fujio Akagi.

'This resembles bubble rings made by dolphins.'

'The vortex rings generated by the sneeze capture the microscopic droplets within the sneeze and transport them to the top and bottom edges of the face shield.'

The model is also being used to reveal ways to improve current shields and make versions that are not as flawed.

'We are currently developing and demonstrating several improved shields,' said Dr Akagi.

A separate scientific paper published in July also found face shields are not protective against Covid-19 — but masks are.

Swiss officials investigated an outbreak of 'several' coronavirus cases that occurred at a hotel in a village in the Alps — even though employers took precautions.

Experts revealed only those who wore plastic visors were infected. But no-one who wore a mask, either alone or in addition to a face shield, caught the coronavirus, according to the study.

Researchers have previously found shields allow nearly 100 per cent of tiny airborne droplets released by coronavirus-infected patients to escape through visors.

A Japanese computer simulation revealed almost all airborne droplets smaller than five micrometres in size — released when talking and breathing — escaped through the visor.

And half of larger droplets measuring 50 micrometres in size — given off by coughs and sneezes — found their way into the air, posing a risk to others.

'No evidence' face shields protect against Covid-19 Hairdressers and barbers should wear face coverings and not just visors in order to help curb the spread of coronavirus, scientists advising the Government said in August. The experts warn that plastic face shields being used in hair salons are unlikely to be an effective control for aerosol transmission of Covid-19 - which scientists fear is one way the disease spreads. The revelation came via a batch of documents released by SAGE and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) says the guidance needs to change. Another study from Switzerland also found the plastic face shields do not work to stop the spread of coronavirus particles. Advertisement

The latest study by researchers at Fukuoka University in Japan and published in the journal Physics of Fluids further adds to the growing pile of proof against the use of face shields.

An alarming video published alongside the study illustrates how air flow from a sneeze can make its way around and up the inside of a face shield and into a person's mouth or nose, rendering the PPE useless without a face mask being worn as well.

Researchers looked specifically at sneezes because of the creation of a phenomena known as vortex rings.

'A vortex ring is a donut-shaped vortex that is generated by an instantaneous ejection of fluid from a circular orifice,' said study author Dr Fujio Akagi.

'This resembles bubble rings made by dolphins.'

'The vortex rings generated by the sneeze capture the microscopic droplets within the sneeze and transport them to the top and bottom edges of the face shield.'

The model is also being used to reveal ways to improve current shields and make versions that are not as flawed.

'We are currently developing and demonstrating several improved shields,' said Dr Akagi.

The war hero, who had recently fought off coronavirus, jumped to his death from a high floor in Moscow.

Valery Severinov - born under Lenin's rule two years after the Bolshevik Revolution - is the latest of dozens of Covid-19 sufferers to die or face injury in tragic falls from high rise buildings in Russia and Ukraine.

101-year-old Russian war veteran Valery Severinov (on of Russia's oldest war heroes, pictured holding a picture of himself in his younger years as a paratrooper) is the latest of dozens of Covid-19 sufferers to die or face injury falling from high rise buildings in Russia and Ukraine

The Second World War veteran had made 119 jumps and was decorated for courage as he took part in defeating the Nazis in Budapest, Prague and Vienna.

Police are investigating his fall but reports say the hero had recently overcome coronavirus and likely remained on medication after he was sent home.

Experts in Russia and Ukraine have questioned whether something about Covid-19 - or medication used to treat it - has made patients with no known suicidal inclinations jump from rise buildings including hospitals.

Russian city Novosibirsk has seen four recent cases involving coronavirus sufferers, none of whom had been earlier registered with psychiatrists.

One was a sportswoman, 38, whose friends believe she was 'half-delirious' with multiple medications when she fell from a high rise hospital window, and another was a retired policeman.

Russia has seen at least seven further cases since August.

Before this well-publicised cases saw the death of police lieutenant-colonel Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, after a 50 feet hospital fall and Dr Natalya Lebedeva, 48, who plunged 60 feet in a fatal incident.

In Shcherbakova's case, the family were told that she had been treated with the antibiotic Levofloxacin.

The powerful antibiotic can be used to treat pneumonia, but in rare cases can interfere with the nervous system and cause serious psychological side effects.

These can include hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

Dr Yelena Nepomnyashchaya, 47, a mother of two from a medical family, sustained fatal injuries after falling 50ft from a window at her Krasnoyarsk hospital.

She fell soon after complaining of an 'acute shortage' of PPE and died on 1 May, the only one of the victims who was not known to be suffering from coronavirus.

Dr Lebedeva was hospitalised with Covid-19 when she plunged 60ft to her death on 24 April after she was 'unfairly blamed' for the spread of coronavirus at her clinic in Star City, near Moscow, the training centre for cosmonauts.

Among them was Oleg Basilayshvili, a respected paediatrician, aged 40, who like the war hero had been recently discharged from a Covid-19 hospital, fell to his death.

Some hospitals have bolted windows or removed handles because of a perceived risk of patients jumping in a 'wave of Covid-19 suicides'.

There have been, too, an unspecified number of hospital 'suicides' of Covid patients not involving window jumps in both countries.

A Novosibirsk man, 42, cut his veins after messaging his family in delirium saying: 'I am telling you all Covid-19 patients are getting killed, they are coming after me next.'

He died in the same hospital that another patient had jumped to his death three days earlier.

In Moscow, pilot Ruslan Valeyev, 28, broke out of his coronavirus hospital and climbed a metal fence fatally injuring himself.

Three females named Zala, Nima and Run Run and Kiumbe, a male, were tested after keepers noticed they showed slight symptoms of coronavirus.

Two staff at the zoo also tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities said, after the outbreak was first detected last month.

Four lions at Barcelona Zoo (pictured) have tested positive for COVID-19, veterinary authorities said on Tuesday, in only the third known case in which large felines have contracted coronavirus

Authorities are investigating how the lions became infected.

Keepers carried out PCR tests on the lions in the same way as humans are tested as the animals are accustomed to contact with the zoo staff - but still required a large amount of skill to perform, the zoo said.

The Veterinary Service of Barcelona contacted colleagues at the Bronx Zoo in New York, where four tigers and three lions tested positive for COVID-19 in April.

In at least one other case involving large felines, a tiger tested positive for the virus and two more were presumed positive after briefly displaying symptoms at Zoo Knoxville in the U.S. state of Tennessee in October, according to the zoo.

'The Zoo has contacted and collaborated with international experts such as the Veterinary Service of the Bronx Zoo [...] that has documented cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in felines,' the Barcelona zoo said in a statement.

Keepers carried out PCR tests on the lions in the same way as humans are tested as the animals are accustomed to contact with the zoo staff. Pictured: Lions at Barcelona zoo

'The lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition - similar to a very mild flu condition - through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well.'

More concerning symptoms of coronavirus - such as difficulty breathing or other respiratory symptoms - were not found in the lions.

All other symptoms cleared after 15 days, except for coughing and sneezing, the zoo said, noting that the case gives them an opportunity to raise awareness about how Covid-19 affects animals - especially big cats.

Information will be shared with other international associations to help them with treating animals that become infected in the future.

The four-year-old male and the females, who are all 16 years old, have had no contact with other animals at the zoo, which is open to visitors.

Barcelona Zoo ruled out any possibility of visitors to the park catching the virus from the lions, saying: 'Simply, no one who comes to see them gets close enough.'

It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes coronavirus - likely evolved up to 70 years ago and resided in bats, unable to spread to another species.

However, it is though that the virus last year jumped into an intermediate species, potentially pangolins or wild dogs, before again jumping into humans, but there is much debate over this.

Yvonne Chow Hau Yee, pictured, was the owner of a dog who died after contracting coronavirus in Hong Kong - believed to be the first instance of such a case

A number of cases have been found other in animals since the outbreak of the disease, both domestic and wild.

According to the CDC, a small number of pet cats and dogs have reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2, most of which became sick after contact with people.

In addition to lions and tigers in zoos in New York, Tennessee and now Barcelona, a puma tested positive for the virus in South Africa.

A number of European countries - including Denmark, the Netherlands and Greece have also seen devastating outbreaks of the virus on mink farms, that has led to the culling of millions of the creatures.

It has been found that once the virus is on a mink farm, it can spread from mink to other creatures.

However, experts are unclear over whether the virus can spread from mink to humans - although reports from Denmark and the Netherlands suggest it can.",MailOnline,"['lions', 'symptoms', 'zoo', 'animals', 'tested', 'barcelona', 'positive', 'virus', 'covid19', 'test', 'mink', 'veterinary']",0

One was a sportswoman, 38, whose friends believe she was 'half-delirious' with multiple medications when she fell from a high rise hospital window, and another was a retired policeman.

Russia has seen at least seven further cases since August.

Before this well-publicised cases saw the death of police lieutenant-colonel Natalya Shcherbakova, 45, after a 50 feet hospital fall and Dr Natalya Lebedeva, 48, who plunged 60 feet in a fatal incident.

In Shcherbakova's case, the family were told that she had been treated with the antibiotic Levofloxacin.

The powerful antibiotic can be used to treat pneumonia, but in rare cases can interfere with the nervous system and cause serious psychological side effects.

These can include hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

It is not known if other hospital window victims were treated with this same drug.

Dr Yelena Nepomnyashchaya, 47, a mother of two from a medical family, sustained fatal injuries after falling 50ft from a window at her Krasnoyarsk hospital.

She fell soon after complaining of an 'acute shortage' of PPE and died on 1 May, the only one of the victims who was not known to be suffering from coronavirus.

Dr Lebedeva was hospitalised with Covid-19 when she plunged 60ft to her death on 24 April after she was 'unfairly blamed' for the spread of coronavirus at her clinic in Star City, near Moscow, the training centre for cosmonauts.

Another medic Dr Alexander Shulepov, 37, plunged from a second floor window sustaining skull fractures.

In June, Nadezhda Salkova, 74, fell from a fourth floor window of Semashko Hospital in Moscow where she was being treated for coronavirus.

Ukraine has seen at least seven cases since October of patients jumping from Covid-19 hospital windows.

Among them was Oleg Basilayshvili, a respected paediatrician, aged 40, who like the war hero had been recently discharged from a Covid-19 hospital, fell to his death.

Some hospitals have bolted windows or removed handles because of a perceived risk of patients jumping in a 'wave of Covid-19 suicides'.

There have been, too, an unspecified number of hospital 'suicides' of Covid patients not involving window jumps in both countries.

A Novosibirsk man, 42, cut his veins after messaging his family in delirium saying: 'I am telling you all Covid-19 patients are getting killed, they are coming after me next.'

He died in the same hospital that another patient had jumped to his death three days earlier.

In Moscow, pilot Ruslan Valeyev, 28, broke out of his coronavirus hospital and climbed a metal fence fatally injuring himself.

Like others he was described as 'delirious' either from his medication or the virus.

Russian virus expert Professor Alexander Chepurnov - who has twice contacted Covid-19 - said: 'There is no evidence that coronavirus is neurotropic (capable of infecting nerve cells).

'There is evidence, however, that it damages the brain, which might change the perception of reality and cause hallucinations.

'Now we are speaking about a need for not only recovery of lungs, but nerve tissues, for people who have been through Covid-19.'

Respected Ukrainian cardiologist Professor Kateryna Amosova, one of her country's most senior medics, has demanded an investigation into such deaths.

She asked: 'Why do Covid-19 patients commit suicides in hospitals?

Respected Ukrainian cardiologist Professor Kateryna Amosova, one of her country's most senior medics, has demanded an investigation into such deaths

'During 25 years of work in Central Kyiv hospital myself and my husband (also a medic) have witnessed three cases of patients committing suicide by jumping out of windows.'

Now she has noted four such deaths within one month which 'definitely requires analyses of medical aspects'.

She said: 'Let's start from asking ourselves if Covid-19 causes neuropsychiatric disorders, and what kind?

'The answer is yet it does, both acute and chronic, from delirium and depression to prolonged feeling of a 'foggy head' and weakness as a post-Covid syndrome, and this is the manifestation of the multi-system effect of its pathogen on the body.'

Another senior Ukrainian medic Professor Vladimir Korsunov warned of a trend of Covid-19 patients exhibiting suicidal traits.

'They try to either jump out of the window, or seek an overdose of pills,' he said.

'It's happening all over the world, and no-one know what to do with it. There is no solution yet.

'In a different situation there should be high-quality monitoring of patients, but in our country this is impossible.

'Perhaps we should install bars in windows, or get help from psychiatrists who are not usually involved in working with patients in our infectious hospitals.

'Or to use antidepressants, yet they don't help everyone.'",MailOnline,"['cases', 'hospital', 'patients', 'demand', 'war', 'high', 'russian', 'rise', 'doctors', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'window', 'buildings', 'probe', 'fell', 'jumping']",0

Three females named Zala, Nima and Run Run and Kiumbe, a male, were tested after keepers noticed they showed slight symptoms of coronavirus.

Two staff at the zoo also tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities said, after the outbreak was first detected last month.

Four lions at Barcelona Zoo (pictured) have tested positive for COVID-19, veterinary authorities said on Tuesday, in only the third known case in which large felines have contracted coronavirus

Authorities are investigating how the lions became infected.

Keepers carried out PCR tests on the lions in the same way as humans are tested as the animals are accustomed to contact with the zoo staff - but still required a large amount of skill to perform, the zoo said.

The Veterinary Service of Barcelona contacted colleagues at the Bronx Zoo in New York, where four tigers and three lions tested positive for COVID-19 in April.

In at least one other case involving large felines, a tiger tested positive for the virus and two more were presumed positive after briefly displaying symptoms at Zoo Knoxville in the U.S. state of Tennessee in October, according to the zoo.

'The Zoo has contacted and collaborated with international experts such as the Veterinary Service of the Bronx Zoo [...] that has documented cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in felines,' the Barcelona zoo said in a statement.

Keepers carried out PCR tests on the lions in the same way as humans are tested as the animals are accustomed to contact with the zoo staff. Pictured: Lions at Barcelona zoo

'The lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition - similar to a very mild flu condition - through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well.'

More concerning symptoms of coronavirus - such as difficulty breathing or other respiratory symptoms - were not found in the lions.

All other symptoms cleared after 15 days, except for coughing and sneezing, the zoo said, noting that the case gives them an opportunity to raise awareness about how Covid-19 affects animals - especially big cats.

Information will be shared with other international associations to help them with treating animals that become infected in the future.

The four-year-old male and the females, who are all 16 years old, have had no contact with other animals at the zoo, which is open to visitors.

Barcelona Zoo ruled out any possibility of visitors to the park catching the virus from the lions, saying: 'Simply, no one who comes to see them gets close enough.'

It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes coronavirus - likely evolved up to 70 years ago and resided in bats, unable to spread to another species.

However, it is though that the virus last year jumped into an intermediate species, potentially pangolins or wild dogs, before again jumping into humans, but there is much debate over this.

Yvonne Chow Hau Yee, pictured, was the owner of a dog who died after contracting coronavirus in Hong Kong - believed to be the first instance of such a case

A number of cases have been found other in animals since the outbreak of the disease, both domestic and wild.

According to the CDC, a small number of pet cats and dogs have reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2, most of which became sick after contact with people.

In addition to lions and tigers in zoos in New York, Tennessee and now Barcelona, a puma tested positive for the virus in South Africa.

A number of European countries - including Denmark, the Netherlands and Greece have also seen devastating outbreaks of the virus on mink farms, that has led to the culling of millions of the creatures.

It has been found that once the virus is on a mink farm, it can spread from mink to other creatures.

The Second World War veteran had made 119 jumps and was decorated for courage as he took part in defeating the Nazis in Budapest, Prague and Vienna.

Prince Albert, 62, became the first head of state to contract that virus when he tested positive in March.

Following his positive result, he spent two weeks in isolation, but after returning home to his wife Princess Charlene, 42, and their five-year-old twins he started experiencing symptoms that continued into June.

Although his initial infection was only mild, Prince Albert told PEOPLE: 'The virus stays with you for quite a while...There were times during the day when it just hit, but not like the kind of drowsiness you feel after a heavy meal.

Intermittent fatigue was a regular occurrence for Prince Albert and although it wasn't a daily experience, he did suffer it two to three times a week.

Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms among those dealing with long-term coronavirus effects.

He became the first head of state to contract the virus, back in March. After his isolation period ended he returned home to his wife Princess Charlene, 42, (pictured) and their five-year-old twins (pictured) but continued to experience bouts of fatigue until June

During the coronavirus lockdown, the prince said he hadn't spent a great deal of time watching TV or films.

Instead, he revealed he had used the time to make his way through books, magazines and phone calls that had all stacked up.

Prince Albert's diagnosis came just nine days after he was pictured sitting opposite Prince Charles at a WaterAid charity event in London.

At the time, the palace said Albert's health 'did not inspire any concern', and said he was continuing to work from his private apartments.

Albert married 42-year-old former South African Olympic swimmer, formerly known as Charlene Wittstock, in 2011. She had twins in 2014.

More than 200 patients were left for hours with limited oxygen at Khyber Teaching Hospital in the northern city of Peshawar due to a shortage of oxygen cylinders at the weekend.

Panicked hospital staff eventually resorted to asking the patients' relatives to try buy oxygen cylinders themselves, though only a small number managed to obtain them.

Six coronavirus patients died at Khyber Teaching Hospital in the northern city of Peshawar, Pakistan after a delay in deliveries caused a shortage of oxygen cylinders on Saturday

The shortage was blamed on the oxygen supply company after a vendor failed to deliver the daily supply of oxygen cylinders.

However, an investigation has been launched and several senior members of staff at the Khyber Teaching Hospital have been suspended.

A spokesman for the government-run hospital told the BBC that five of the dead were patients in the coronavirus ward and one in the intensive care unit.

According to local media, the problems at the hospital began at around 8pm on Saturday evening when the daily supply of fresh oxygen cylinders did not arrive.

More than 200 patients were left for hours with limited oxygen as the hospital rationed supplies after a vendor failed to deliver the daily supply of fresh oxygen cylinders

The hospital rationed its supplies and thirteen patients were moved to the emergency department where a limited supply of oxygen was available however, it too eventually depleted.

A new supply of oxygen cylinders was finally delivered to the hospital at 4am on Sunday but not before several patients had died and many others deteriorated into a critical condition.

According to a report on the incident, the chronic oxygen deficiency 'went unnoticed, unsupervised and unchecked' and no backup oxygen supply had been put in place.

The shortage was blamed on the oxygen supply company however, an investigation has been launched and several senior members of staff have been suspended as a hospital report called it a case of 'criminal negligence'

The hospital called it a case of 'criminal negligence' and seven staff members, including the hospital director have been suspended with immediate effect.

Although his initial infection was only mild, Prince Albert told PEOPLE: 'The virus stays with you for quite a while...There were times during the day when it just hit, but not like the kind of drowsiness you feel after a heavy meal.

'It was really just an experience of physical fatigue, like the kind that comes on when you've done too much or when you're coming off an illness.

'This virus stays with you quite a while.'

Intermittent fatigue was a regular occurrence for Prince Albert and although it wasn't a daily experience, he did suffer it two to three times a week.

Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms among those dealing with long-term coronavirus effects.

He became the first head of state to contract the virus, back in March. After his isolation period ended he returned home to his wife Princess Charlene, 42, (pictured) and their five-year-old twins (pictured) but continued to experience bouts of fatigue until June

During the coronavirus lockdown, the prince said he hadn't spent a great deal of time watching TV or films.

Instead, he revealed he had used the time to make his way through books, magazines and phone calls that had all stacked up.

Prince Albert's diagnosis came just nine days after he was pictured sitting opposite Prince Charles at a WaterAid charity event in London.

At the time, the palace said Albert's health 'did not inspire any concern', and said he was continuing to work from his private apartments.

Albert married 42-year-old former South African Olympic swimmer, formerly known as Charlene Wittstock, in 2011. She had twins in 2014.

2020-12-06 22:59:56+00:00,11,"Ahead of the roll-out of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine, we have answered important questions explaining how one gets a jab, who it's administered by and how long it lasts.

You’ll be contacted and asked to book an appointment under a ‘call and recall system’.

This is possible because central NHS computers have access to the population’s personal information – such as our name, age, address and phone number.

The ‘call’ is to invite you to arrange an appointment for the first jab of two necessary doses; the ‘recall’ is for the booster 21 days later.

Jabs are via needle in the upper arm.

Partial immunity is estimated after 12 days, with full effectiveness seven days after the second dose – (i.e. 28 days after first jab).

You’ll be asked to stay at the vaccine site for 15 minutes after the jab in case of a bad reaction.

Vaccine staff will be working on Christmas Day. England’s 6,800 GP practices are organising into around 1,000 ‘networks’, and will choose one dedicated surgery to act as a vaccination centre.

The Pfizer vaccine has been trialled on more than 43,000 people across six countries. With no safety concerns raised, NHS staff and healthcare volunteers will soon start administering the jab, which offers six months of Covid-19 immunity

Who'll give the jab?

Regular NHS staff, newly-trained recruits and volunteers such as the St John Ambulance.

Will it grant immunity from Covid-19?

Analysis shows the jab can prevent 95 per cent of people from getting Covid-19, including 94 per cent in older age groups. Immunity is expected to last at least six months and possibly much longer.

Side-effects?

The Pfizer vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns were raised.

The World Health Organisation says the jab is an 'extra control element,' in tackling Covid-19, meaning other measures, such as social distancing and wearing masks, will stay in place

Some trial volunteers experienced sore arms, fever and muscle ache, but nothing more serious.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is monitoring for anything more dangerous.

Will social distancing and masks still be needed?

Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation’s special envoy for Covid-19, says the vaccine is ‘an extra control element,’ adding: ‘It’s not going to replace the other measures for a number of months, even perhaps a year, so we’ll have to keep doing physical distancing, hygiene, mask wearing and isolating when we’re sick.’

The cost

Ministers have not said how much, but the US government ordered 100million doses from Pfizer for $1.95billion.

That suggests about £30 for the two shots required per person.

The Oxford vaccine is likely to cost £2.23 a dose, or £4.46 for the two-dose course needed.

Immunity starts to build following the first vaccine, but second one is required to give full protection from Covid-19. Health Secretary Matt Hancock hopes the Government will ease restrictions once the jab sees infection rates come down

How many people need to be vaccinated to lift restrictions?

Health Secretary Matt Hancock concedes that while the vaccine protects an individual, it’s unclear what impact it has on reducing transmission.

He’s said that as ‘more and more vulnerable people are vaccinated, we hope to see those rates come down and therefore we will be able to lift the restrictions.’

Is it available privately?

No. Pfizer is only supplying governments ‘during the initial pandemic stage’.

Vaccine passports

Despite no plans for official ‘immunity passports’ – which could give people who have been inoculated, and thus virus-free, easier access to places such as pubs and restaurants – Ministers admit discussing their possible use.",MailOnline,"['long', 'days', 'immunity', 'administers', 'nhs', 'vaccine', 'covid19', 'volunteers', 'staff', 'months', 'pfizer', 'jab']",0

2020-12-03 23:31:05+00:00,18,"Cronyism, state secrecy and needless bureaucracy may have robbed China of the chance to stop coronavirus before it became a pandemic, an investigation into the country's early testing fiasco has revealed.

Investigators found that just three obscure companies with close ties to officials at China's CDC were initially allowed to make tests to detect the virus, most of which were unreliable and took ages to return results because of a decision to process all of the kits in Beijing.

That meant officials in charge of overseeing the country's response to the pandemic were blinded to the disease's spread because of a lack of accurate testing data.

Meanwhile patients who doctors were sure had the virus were discharged from hospital after testing negative on a faulty kit, and went on to infect others.

For almost two weeks between January 5 and January 17, China officially recorded no new cases of the virus when in fact hundreds were infected, as officials delayed ordering travel bans, bans on gatherings, and city-wide lockdowns.

While it is impossible to say for certain, one study suggested that had those actions been taken two weeks earlier, it could have reduced the overall number of cases by 86 per cent - which might have been enough to stop the pandemic.

China initially struggled to test for coronavirus, a situation that was made worse by cronyism, state secrecy and needless bureaucracy, an investigation has found (file image)

In the early days in Wuhan, the first city first struck by the virus, getting a COVID test was so difficult that residents compared it to winning the lottery.

Throughout the Chinese city in January, thousands of people waited in hours-long lines for hospitals, sometimes next to corpses lying in hallways.

But most couldn't get the test they needed to be admitted as patients. And for the few who did, the tests were often faulty, resulting in false negatives.

The widespread test shortages and problems at a time when the virus could have been slowed were caused largely by secrecy and cronyism at China's top disease control agency, an Associated Press investigation has found.

The flawed testing system prevented scientists and officials from seeing how fast the virus was spreading - another way China fumbled its early response to the virus.

Earlier AP reporting showed how top Chinese leaders delayed warning the public and withheld information from the World Health Organization, supplying the most comprehensive picture yet of China's initial missteps.

Taken together, these mistakes in January facilitated the virus' spread through Wuhan and across the world undetected, in a pandemic that has now sickened more than 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.

China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, the reporting found.

China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties

The deals took place within a culture of backdoor connections that quietly flourished in an underfunded public health system, according to the investigation, which was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails obtained by the AP.

The Shanghai companies - GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology - paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution.

The price: One million RMB ($146,600) each, the sources said. It's unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.

In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. In a departure from past practice for at least two epidemics, the NHC told Wuhan hospitals to send virus samples - from which tests can be developed - only to labs under its authority.

It also made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated, and endorsed only test kits made by the Shanghai companies.

These measures contributed to not a single new case being reported by Chinese authorities between Jan. 5 and 17, even though retrospective infection data shows that hundreds were infected.

The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public, barring large gatherings and curbing travel.

One study estimates that intervention two weeks earlier could have reduced the number of cases by 86 percent, although it's uncertain whether earlier action could have halted the spread of the virus worldwide.

When tests from the three companies arrived, many didn't work properly, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives.

And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.

With few and faulty kits, only one in 19 infected people in Wuhan was tested and found positive as of Jan. 31, according to an estimate by Imperial College London.

A man in Wuhan is tested for the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, tests were extremely rare and many of them were unreliable - returning false negative results

Others without tests or with false negatives were sent back home, where they could spread the virus.

Days after he first started coughing on Jan. 23rd, Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher, waited in an eight-hour line at a Wuhan hospital.

A CT scan showed signs of viral infection in both his lungs, but he couldn't get the test he needed to be hospitalized.

When Peng finally got a test on Jan. 30, it turned out negative. But his fever wouldn't drop, and his family begged officials for another test.

His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.

'There were very, very few tests, basically none..if you couldn't prove you were positive, you couldn't get admitted to a hospital,' his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October.

'The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.'

China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing, which varied widely from nation to nation. Germany, for example, developed a test that became the World Health Organization gold standard days after the Chinese government released genetic sequences on Jan. 12.

But in the U.S., the CDC declined to use the WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China.

Other countries also had the benefit of learning from China's experience. But China was grappling with a new pathogen, and it wasn't yet clear how bad the pandemic would be or how many tests would be needed.

'It was very early,' said Jane Duckett, a professor at the University of Glasgow examining the Chinese government's response to the coronavirus. She said the government was 'just trying to figure it out.'

Still, the hiccups and delays in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.

'Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,' said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.

'It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.'

China's foreign ministry and China's top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

'We did a brilliant job, we worked so hard,' said Gao Fu, the head of China CDC, in a videoconference in July. 'Unluckily, unfortunately, this virus we are facing, it's so special.'

China initially allowed just three companies, including BioGerm (CEO Zhao Baihui pictured), to make the test kits - despite the firms being neither the largest, nor the top of their fields

GeneoDx (pictured right, a booth the company set up at a science fair) was among the companies initially awarded testing contracts, after making secret payments to the CDC

None of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits for the biggest pandemic in a century were well-known in the industry.

For one engineer from a Wuhan-based diagnostics firm, the Shanghai competitors popped out of nowhere 'like bamboo shoots' - all the more so because his company had the factories and expertise to produce testing kits in the city where the virus was first detected.

'We were surprised, it was very strange,' the engineer said, declining to be named to speak on a sensitive topic.

'We hadn't heard about it at all, and then suddenly there's test kits from certain companies you have to use, and you can't use ones from anyone else?'

BioGerm was officially founded just over three years ago in a conference room, where the CEO mulled how to survive in a small and crowded market for test kits.

GeneoDx had fewer than 100 employees, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate records database - compared to competitors that employ hundreds or even thousands of staff.

But what the companies lacked in resources or experience, they made up for in connections.

Company posts, along with hundreds of internal emails and documents obtained by The Associated Press, show extensive ties between the three companies and top China CDC researchers in Beijing and Shanghai.

Chinese regulators barred AP attempts to obtain credit reports on the companies, saying they were classified as 'confidential enterprises' during the outbreak.

Despite China's efforts over the years to reform public health and push for open bidding in a competitive marketplace, medical companies still cultivate personal relationships with officials to secure deals, according to seven executives from different competitors.

The [test] quality was not good. But because they paid a million yuan, they were on the list

Under President Xi Jinping, China has cracked down on corruption, but industry insiders say a lack of firm boundaries between public and private in China's health system can create opportunities for graft.

It's unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.

They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.

Even amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, 'there is no excuse for the flow of cash from these companies to the CDC,' he said.

Chinese bribery laws also state that any financial transaction has to be recorded and documented clearly.

The AP was unable to ascertain whether the agreements between the CDC and the Shanghai companies were documented, but a CDC employee with access to some of the agency's finances said there was no record of them.

Despite the questions around bribery, other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during major natural disasters.

The Chinese government is pushing to cultivate domestic companies focused on emergency response technologies, including test kits, to protect its national interest.

'Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,' said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law.

'Anything affecting the national interest can be deemed to be of utmost importance for special regulations... I wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgement.'

China CDC guidelines state that the agency is responsible for maintaining a reserve of testing chemicals to screen for rare pathogens, but do not specify how to procure them. An AP search of CDC procurement bids did not turn up any records, even though some other emergency procurements were publicly documented.

China initially required patients to have a positive test result to get a hospital bed, meaning those who took a test with a faulty kit were returned home - where they spread the virus

The China CDC has about a sixth the staff of its separate American equivalent, and they often earn far lower wages than in the private sector.

So many employees from the China CDC have departed for private sector jobs over the past decade, draining its labs of talent.

Among those who left was BioGerm's founder, Zhao Baihui, the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC's microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm's predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC.

In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars' worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary even as she herself was at times in charge of purchasing, internal emails, records and contracts obtained by the AP show.

After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao spearheaded lucrative contracts with government officials - such as one worth 400,000 RMB ($60,000) with Shanghai customs officials where her husband worked, and another worth 55,500 RMB ($8,400) with CDC officials in Shanghai's Pudong district, the emails and contracts show. Zhao declined to speak when reached by phone, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China's cabinet.

Before the outbreak, GeneoDx largely imported kits and acquired foreign technology to expand its business rather than develop its own products, according to company posts and a China CDC employee familiar with its operations.

In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits, according to an internal document the AP obtained.

In November, the company won a contract to sell 900,000 RMB ($137,000) worth of test kits to Tan's institute.

GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.

Also in attendance at the invitation-only event was BioGerm, as well as other companies that used the conference to promote their products, blurring the line between the government and the private sector.

China CDC staff were invited to join a BioGerm group on WeChat, a Chinese messaging application, which CEO Zhao later used to sell coronavirus test kits, according to a CDC employee and a screenshot seen by the AP.

The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. Its founder, Li Hui, coauthored a paper with Tan on coronavirus tests in 2012 and 'jointly developed' a test kit for the MERS outbreak in 2015 with Tan's institute.

In an interview, CEO Li said the CDC routinely contracted with his company to make emergency testing chemicals.

Unlike during previous epidemics, Chinese labs were initially stopped from developing their own tests or processing the results of tests (pictured, regional CDC headquarters in Wuhan)

He said Tan's lab at the China CDC had contacted him on Jan. 4 or 5 to make testing chemicals for the coronavirus based on CDC designs. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.

'We've been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it's normal,' Li said.

Their connections situated the three little-known companies in prime position in January, when a then-unknown pathogen was about to sweep the country and the world and change their fortunes.

The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.

In the past, such as with H7N9 in 2013, the China CDC sent test designs to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen.

It also shipped along the chemical compounds needed - in effect the ingredients - for hospitals and CDC branches to mix their own test kits as soon as possible.

At first it looked like the China CDC was using the same playbook this time. The CDC had found the genetic map, or genome, of the virus by Jan. 3.

By the next day, under CDC official Tan, the Emergency Technology Center at its Institute for Viral Disease Control had come up with test designs.

But this time, the government held back information about the genome and test designs. Instead, the China CDC finalized 'technology transfer' agreements to give the test designs to the three Shanghai companies, according to four people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.

The CDC did not have the authority to altogether prevent other scientists with competing agencies and companies from getting samples through back door routes and coming up with their own test recipes.

But it tried to stymie such efforts and stop testing from being carried out.

For example, Dr. Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, obtained patient samples on her own, found the genome from them and came up with a test by Jan. 3, according to a slideshow presentation she gave in March.

But her lab fell under the jurisdiction of a competing agency to the CDC, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. The CDC barred her from obtaining more samples and testing for cases.

'There's no open collaboration mechanism,' said a public health expert who often works with the China CDC, declining to be named for fear of damaging relations there. 'Everyone wants their turf.'

A renowned coronavirus expert in Wuhan had come up with a test by Jan. 3. The CDC barred her from testing for cases

Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. Otherwise, the cases would not be counted in the national coronavirus tally.

'It was absolutely abnormal,' said a CDC lab technician, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution. 'They were totally trying to make it harder for us to report any confirmed cases.'

In secret evaluations of test kits on Jan. 10, the CDC also approved only those from the three Shanghai companies, according to internal plans and instructions obtained by the AP.

The Chinese government finally made its genomes public on Jan. 12, a day after another team published one without authorization. That opened the door for more companies to make their own test kits.

However, China's top health agency, the National Health Commission, still urged medical staff to buy the test kits from Huirui, BioGerm and GeneoDx that the CDC had validated, according to internal instructions obtained by the AP.

The evaluations and selections of test kits were conducted with the knowledge and direction of China's top health official, Ma Xiaowei, according to a CDC post on Jan. 13.

On Jan. 14, Ma held an internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, as AP earlier reported.

After that, China's health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. BioGerm began taking orders from provincial CDC staff across the country on WeChat, a Chinese social media application.

'We've been entrusted by the national CDC to issue kits for you,' Zhao said, according to a screenshot of one of the group chats obtained by The Associated Press.

'Quick! Give me, give me,' said one staffer in the Sichuan CDC.

But the kits from GeneoDx kept showing inconclusive results, the CDC technician told the AP, and eventually her superior ordered her to toss them aside.

The kits from Huirui were also unreliable, and the only ones that worked consistently were from BioGerm, she said.

'The quality was not good. Bad, poor quality,' said a public health expert familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified to avoid damaging ties with the China CDC. 'But because they had a collaboration with the (CDC) Institute for Viral Disease Control and they paid a million yuan, they were on the list.'

A disease modelling study found that, had officials in China acted against coronavirus two weeks earlier, 86 per cent of cases could have been prevented

BioGerm's test kits were more dependable in part because they used chemicals from Invitrogen, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech giant Thermo Fisher. Huirui and GeneoDx used their own mixes instead, with more unreliable results.

Much larger competitors, including Chinese genetics giant BGI and Tianlong, developed their own kits in January, which were later found to be more effective than those made by the Shanghai companies. But those test kits weren't endorsed by the China CDC.

'No test protocol, no primers and probes, then of course there's no way to confirm cases,' said another China CDC employee who declined to be identified for fear of retribution. 'And then, all of a sudden, you tell all the CDCs: purchase from these companies, now go for it. Then - chaos and shortage. Valuable time wasted.'

Chen Weijun, BGI's chief infectious disease scientist, also said the early products recommended by the China CDC had 'quality problems.' When asked why the China CDC selected the three Shanghai companies, Chen demurred.

'You better ask the CDC this question,' said Chen, who collaborated with CDC researchers to publish the first paper on the virus.

'But actually, everyone understands what's going on, why this happened, right? You can reach your own conclusions, right?'

A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again. But test kits were scarce. Some other cities in the same province didn't get kits until Jan. 22, and even those were often flawed.

Samples from 213 patients in February using GeneoDx tests suggested a false-negative rate of over 30 percent, a study by Shenzhen doctors found.

A March clinical trial report showed that among the test kits certified at the time, GeneoDx was the worst performer, followed by BioGerm. In general, the rate of false negatives for COVID tests varies widely, from 2% to more than 37%.

Philippe Klein, a French doctor who treated foreign patients in Wuhan during the outbreak, estimated that about 20 percent of the tests turned up false negatives. Still, he said, delays in producing accurate tests kits are natural at the start of an outbreak.

'The Chinese did a lot in a short time,' Klein said. 'It was a new test, so in the beginning, there was a lack of tests, of course.'

On Jan. 22, the National Health Commission quietly removed the names of the three Shanghai companies from its coronavirus guide as preferred distributors.

After the Chinese government ordered Wuhan shut down on Jan. 23, the three companies faced massive logistical hurdles to getting their tests in.

On Jan. 26, officials set up a fast-track 'green channel' for companies to get their test kits approved.

The National Medical Products Administration approved test kits from seven companies, including BioGerm and GeneoDx but not Huirui. Li, Huirui's CEO, said it was because his company was inexperienced in obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial tests.

But it took time for other companies to ramp up production and ship tests in, leaving Wuhan struggling to meet demand into early February and depriving many residents of treatment.

Peng died on Feb. 19. His mother now passes the days gazing blankly out her window, sobbing and lighting candles in his memory.

'In the eyes of officials, he was like a grain of sand or a blade of grass. But in our home, he was our sky, he was our everything,' Zhong said. 'Without him, we can never be happy again.'

The same pandemic that killed Peng brought the Shanghai test kit companies and related scientists fame and fortune.

In September, Tan, the China CDC researcher in charge of developing test kits, was appointed the inaugural director of a new National Novel Coronavirus Center.

In a nationally televised ceremony, GeneoDx's parent firm won plaudits from President Xi for 'outstanding' contributions in the struggle against COVID-19, including developing a test kit.

Huirui has expanded and is now selling commercial test kits for the first time - not in China, but in Latin America, CEO Li said.

And the pandemic has allowed BioGerm to 'stand out,' reaching its business targets much faster than planned, said top marketing executive Guo Xiaoling at a trade show in late August at a five-star hotel.

'Because of the epidemic, 2020 has been a really special year,' Guo said. 'The country and the economy suffered major damage. But for our nucleic acid diagnostics industry, this year has actually been a bonus.'",MailOnline,"['tests', 'shanghai', 'china', 'cronyism', 'allowed', 'cdc', 'health', 'spread', 'bureaucracy', 'testing', 'companies', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'secrecy', 'test', 'kits', 'jan']",0
2020-12-03 11:29:20+00:00,7,"Eight people who drank hand sanitizer at a house party in Russia after the alcohol ran out have now died, including the parents of five children who are now orphaned.

A 48-year-old woman, the children's mother, became the latest to died on Thursday after succumbing to internal injuries caused by the industrial-grade alcohol.

Her husband was among five men aged between 27 and 69 who were the first to die, along with a woman, 41, and another person, whose gender and age were not given.

A 48-year-old woman - the mother of five children - has become the eighth person to died after drinking hand sanitizer at a house party in Russia (the house, pictured)

The woman's husband was among the first to die after the party in this house on November 19, meaning their five children are now orphaned

All seven of those who died, plus the mother, had attended a house party in Tomtor village on November 19.

Another man, from the neighbouring Aldansky district, has also died from consuming the sanitizer but was not connected to the party.

A ninth party attendee, aged 32, is still in hospital and is expected to survive the poisoning but will likely go blind, doctors say.

The party-goers died after drinking sanitizer that contained 69 per cent methanol, an industrial alcohol used as a solvent

The lethal sanitizer contained up to 69 per cent methanol, an industrial alcohol used as a solvent, pesticide, and sometimes as a fuel source.

It is poisonous when consumed by humans, unlike its chemical cousin ethanol, which is commonly found in beers, wines and spirits.

The legal limit for methanol in hand sanitizer products is just 3.5 per cent.

Businessman Alexander Kalinin, 44, from Sverdlovsk region, has been arrested and accused of supplying the sanitizer, which has been tracked to kindergartens, schools, businesses and a jail.

He is currently being held under house arrest while an investigation is carried out, and is facing six years in jail if convicted.

Almost 4,800 litres of the deadly concoction have been seized so far, but police believe that more was supplied.

A ninth person who attended the party, a man aged 32, is expected to survive but doctors may be unable to save his eyesight

Six others were flown by a medical evacuation aircraft to regional capital Yakutsk.

Methanol can be lethal to humans because, once inside the body, it is processed into acid which enters the bloodstream and attacks tissues.

Symptoms of acute methanol poisoning can include dizziness, mania and amnesia; severe abdominal pains and internal bleeding; blurred vision and hallucinations; kidney failure and heart problems.

Longer term effects include coma, possible death, and potential blindness in those who recover from the initial onset.

China has been vaccinating essential workers with Covid-19 vaccine candidates under an emergency scheme launched in July with no reported adverse effects, according to the officials.

In October, a city in eastern China began offering its residents an experimental coronavirus vaccine for £46 per person.

Sinopharm, a state-owned Chinese drug firm, said last month that nearly a million people had taken its vaccine candidate, despite the jab had not yet provided any clear clinical evidence of efficacy.

According to the US analyst, Beijing has recently offered the jab to the North Korean leader and his family.

'Kim Jong Un and multiple other high-ranking officials within the Kim family and leadership network have been vaccinated for coronavirus within the last two to three weeks thanks to a vaccine candidate supplied by the Chinese government,' Kazianis wrote in an article for online outlet 19FortyFive.

Citing US medical scientist Peter J. Hotez, he said at least three Chinese companies were developing a coronavirus vaccine, including Sinovac Biotech Ltd, CanSinoBio and China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), an unlisted Beijing-based company.

But none of the firms have unveiled results of Phase 3 clinical trials of their experimental COVID-19 vaccines, which are under way outside China.

North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infections, but South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the country had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China - the source of the pandemic - before shutting the border in late January.

Microsoft said last month that two North Korean hacking groups had tried to break into the network of vaccine developers in multiple countries, without specifying the companies targeted. Sources told Reuters they included British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

The NIS said last week it had foiled North Korea's attempts to hack into South Korean COVID-19 vaccine makers.

2020-12-01 20:15:05+00:00,12,"People who experience asthma are 30 per cent less likely to contract Covid-19, according to a new research paper.

In a 37,000-strong cohort, Israeli experts found a higher proportion of asthma sufferers in the group who tested negative for coronavirus than those who tested positive.

This suggests various factors to do with the common lung condition are somehow nullifying the effects of the virus or keeping it from replicating.

The study authors suggest it could be thanks to anti-inflammatory medicine called corticosteroids, usually administered by inhalers.

The team stress, however, that asthma patients should continue taking recommended medication during the pandemic.

People with asthma are less likely to contract Covid-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it may be because their inhalers are helping to control the virus, a study claims

'Bronchial asthma has not been adequately assessed in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19),' said the team from Tel-Aviv University in Tel-Aviv, Israel.

'We observed lower Covid-19 susceptibility in patients with pre-existing asthma.'

Researchers suggest three main theories for why people with asthma are less likely to test positive for Covid-19, as explained by study author Dr Eugene Merzon to the Jerusalem Post.

Firstly, the difference may be sociological – because people with pre-existing respiratory conditions in particular have been strongly warned about the dangers of exposing themselves to the virus, they've been extra vigilant.

The NHS, for example, lists people with severe asthma to be 'at high risk from complications caused by coronavirus infection and those with less severe asthma to be at moderate risk.

People with asthma have therefore been more likely to adhere to Health Ministry instructions, including wearing masks, social distancing and maintaining good hygiene, the authors suggest.

The second theory is to do with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – an enzyme attached to the cell membranes of cells located in the arteries, lungs and other organs, and already known to be the 'gateway' for coronavirus infection.

Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 virus binding to ACE2 receptors on a human cell, the initial stage of COVID-19 infection

ACE2 is essentially a receptor on the surface of cells which binds to the coronavirus and allows it to enter and infect cells.

But respiratory conditions like asthma are associated with significant reductions in the expression of ACE2, meaning a smaller possibility of infection.

Lastly, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), the first-line therapy for patients with persistent asthma, may also reduce expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, as suggested by a previous study this year.

Whether and how commonly used ICS therapies promote or protect against infection by SARS-CoV-2 remains a crucial question, however.

For this new study, researchers took data from a nationwide health fund database of 725,000 members belonging to Israeli health provider Leumit Health Services, of which most of the study authors belong to.

People with asthma may be more conscious of using personal protective equipment (pictuired) because they know they're at risk

Specifically, they looked at a total of 37,469 subjects who were tested for Covid-19 from February to June 2020.

In all, 2,266 people, or 6 per cent of the total sample, tested positive for the illness.

Asthma was found in 153 (6.75 per cent) of subjects in the Covid-19-positive group and in 3,388 (9.62 per cent) of the Covid-19-negative group.

After adjusting for sex, age, smoking, and comorbidity factors, the team found a negative association of asthma with the likelihood of being positive for Covid-19, with a 29 per cent difference (with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.71).

Researchers said their observation 'deserves further replication in larger samples' and with patients from other institutions.

They also stressed that medical staff should 'continue to treat asthma according to the existing asthma guidelines and recommendations'.

He is survived by a son, four stepchildren, 11 grandchildren and three great grandchildren, according to his obituary.

Wilhite started his glittering career at the online service provider CompuServe, where he developed the Graphic Interchange Format in 1987 - which would later become an internet phenomenon in the early 2010s known as the GIF.

'He invented GIF all by himself - he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it,' Kathleen told The Verge.

'He would figure out everything privately in his head and the go to town programming it on the computer.'

According to Kathleen, the GIF was the thing Wilhite was most proud of.

In 2012 as the invention become largely popular with Millennials sharing their reactions in the form of GIFs, it was named word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary.

Once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts, how to properly say GIF has been debated since it was invented in 1987 as a means of neatly compressing images.

In 2013, Wilhite settled once and for all the long debate over the right pronunciation of the word, saying the G 'was soft,' and the word sounded like the peanut butter brand.

'The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations,' Wilhite said in an email interview with the New York Times . 'They are wrong.'

Wilhite also told the New York Times that his favorite GIF was the dancing baby meme, which 'went viral before going viral' was a thing.

GIPHY tweeted a tribute to Wilhite, prompting users of the internet reaction to remember fondly the creator

As expected, GIF users shared their favorites to honor Wilhite

'In honor, here's the first ever gif! (at least i'm 99 percent sure this is the one),' another user tweeted along with a plane GIF.

'I think we should stop arguing and let the man rest. He is with Jod now,' someone replied, making light of the situation

Wilhite's invention won him much praise over the last 35 years and even more in the last ten or so as meme culture has embraced the file as a means of quickly and easily moving messages motivated by everything from comedy to politics across the Web.

GIPHY tweeted a tribute to Wilhite, prompting users of the internet reaction to remember fondly the creator.

'The GIPHY team is sad to hear of the passing of Stephen Wilhite, the creator of the GIF file format. GIPHY was built on a sincere love for the GIF — and we are indebted to the creativity and vision of Mr. Wilhite.'

Wilhite was honored in 2013 with a Lifetime Achievement Webby Award in recognition of inventing the file format

Even after retiring, Wihite kept the wheels inside his brain turning, often taking trips with his wife, camping and building his model train set

Wilhite was honored in 2013 with a Lifetime Achievement Webby Award in recognition of inventing the file format.

In the words of the official Webby website:

'The proliferation of the GIF within today's meme-powered, Tumblr-driven pop culture, proves it a lasting format still among the most celebrated on the Web (despite the hotly contested controversy over its correct pronunciation).

'With 2012 being the 25th anniversary of the GIF we think the 17th Annual Webby Awards is a most fitting event to honor and celebrate Steve Wilhite and this historical achievement.'

Wilhite went on to work at America Online before retiring in the early 2000s.

Even after retiring, Wihite kept the wheels inside his brain turning, often taking trips with his wife, camping and building his model train set.

'When we had the house built we actually had a whole section in the basement for his train room. He always did the design and electric work for the layout,' Kathleen told The Verge.

2022-03-24 04:36:12+00:00,22,"Stephen Wilhite, the creator of the 'GIF', died earlier this month at the age of 74 after battling COVID-19.

The innovative computer scientist died on March 14, his wife Kathaleen confirmed on Wednesday.

He is survived by a son, four stepchildren, 11 grandchildren and three great grandchildren, according to his obituary.

Wilhite started his glittering career at the online service provider CompuServe, where he developed the Graphic Interchange Format in 1987 - which would later become an internet phenomenon in the early 2010s known as the GIF.

'He invented GIF all by himself - he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it,' Kathleen told The Verge.

'He would figure out everything privately in his head and the go to town programming it on the computer.'

According to Kathleen, the GIF was the thing Wilhite was most proud of.

In 2012 as the invention become largely popular with Millennials sharing their reactions in the form of GIFs, it was named word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary.

2022-03-23 23:59:03+00:00,2,"Moderna announced Wednesday morning that it has successfully completed clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in children as young as six months old - and it will soon submit data to federal regulators to get the shot approved.

The Phase 2 and 3 trials were recently completed and included the six months to two years old age group, and the two to six years old groups. Both received two 25 microgram vaccine doses.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company hopes to have its shot available for young children as early as this summer.

Moderna's vaccine is currently only approved for adults 18 and older, and has run into trouble - especially overseas - due to concerns of myocarditis forming in recipients under the age of 30.

'Given the need for a vaccine against COVID-19 in infants and young children we are working with the U.S. FDA and regulators globally to submit these data as soon as possible,' Stephane Bancel, CEO of the company, said in a statement.

If approved, Moderna could pull out an unlikely victory in the race against Pfizer to get its vaccine approved for children under the age of five years old.

Moderna announced Wednesday that it has completed Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in children aged six months to six years old. The children will receive a dosage a quarter the size of what adults currently receive

Pfizer's shot is currently the only one in America authorized for children, with those as young as five years old eligible, while only adults can get the Moderna shot.

Only 27 percent of five to 11 year olds in the country are fully vaccinated, and COVID-19 is generally more mild in children than adults.

The recently completed Moderna trials enrolled 6,700 children six months to six years old. Another group of around 5,000 children aged six to 17 were involved in Moderna clinical trials as well.

For comparison, the clinical trial for the jab in adults performed in 2020 included 30,000 adults.

There were no severe cases in Moderna's pediatric trial for either vaccine or placebo participants.

The dose size tested was 25 micrograms - a quarter of the dose that adults receive for each of their first two shots.

Moderna reports that the shot was just as effective in the younger age group as the full dose is for adults on average.

It was 44 percent effective against Omicron infection for the children aged six months to two years old, and 38 percent effective for those aged three to six.

There have been some concerns about the size of the dose. By comparison, the dosage of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which uses similar messenger RNA technology - was 10 micrograms for five to 11 year olds.

Pfizer is testing three microgram doses for children younger than 5.

'FDA did ask us to evaluate lower doses and we intend to do so,' said Moderna's top scientist, Dr Jacqueline Miller.

'However, we believe that the current data really support the dose selections that we have made in this age group... We are confident in the dose that we've chosen.'

The company has already submitted data from trials in children aged five to 11 to regulators, and announced that it plans to do the same for even younger children.

'We remain committed to helping to end the COVID-19 pandemic with a vaccine for children of all ages,'' Bancel said.

Not all experts agree that vaccines for children this young are necessary to end the pandemic, though.

Children face little risk from COVID-19, with a ever-growing trove of data showing that they are not nearly as affected by it as adults are.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that children only account less than 0.1 percent of Covid deaths in the U.S. since the pandemic first began.

Not all experts are convinced that children require the COVID-19 vaccine, since deaths are rare, they are less likely to have a symptomatic case and they may even be less likely to spread the virus

Pfizer has also attempted to get its Covid vaccine approved for children in the six months to six year old age group, but has run into issues as the small dosage had minimal effectiveness is older aged children

A study from the University of Utah last year found that 50 percent of pediatric Covid cases are asymptomatic. The study was performed before the more-mild Omicron variant emerged, meaning the risk for children to even feel symptoms is likely lower now.

Children may also be less likely to spread the virus when infected, with a German study finding that they release as little as only 25 percent of virus particles as adults do.

Data revealed by New York state officials at the end of last month also found that the shot was only 12 percent effective at preventing Covid infection for children aged five to 11.

Florida Surgeon General Joseph Lapado even issued guidance earlier this month recommending 'healthy' children aged 17 of younger not to get the shot.

There is also the concern of myocarditis which, while limited, has been higher for younger Moderna recipients than those of every other vaccine.

Last year, European countries like Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark and France all either restricted or stopped the use of the Moderna shot in people 30 and younger out of fear of recipients developing rare heart inflammation.

Officials in those nations instead recommended younger people to receive the Pfizer vaccine.

Pfizer has run into some issues in getting its vaccine out to the youngest age groups too, though.

The company had to shift its Covid vaccine regimen for the youngest children up to three doses from two, as the smaller, three microgram doses, were almost entirely ineffective in children three and four years old.

2022-03-16 01:15:11+00:00,78,"A former World Health Organisation scientist says the new BA.2 Omicron subvariant sweeping the world is one of the most infectious diseases the Earth has seen - and almost everyone will be exposed to the virus.

While the now-dominant strain is not as deadly as previous ones, including Delta, it is up to six times more transmissible than the original strain of Covid-19, Professor Adrian Esterman told Daily Mail Australia.

Predictions of a big surge in cases became a reality in New South Wales on Wednesday with 30,402 positive tests returned in the previous 24 hours, almost triple the number reported on Tuesday.

The BA.2 variant is also up to 30 per cent more infectious than the initial BA.1 version of Omicron which forced the reinstitution of lockdowns at Christmas.

'We think [the first] Omicron is very similar to Delta and that BA.2 is then another 25-30 per cent more contagious,' James Wood, a public health mathematician at the University of NSW told Daily Mail Australia.

The higher risk of contagiousness comes from the variant's superior ability to 'evade' immunity - meaning even triple-vaccinated people are susceptible to catching the new strain.

A former World Health Organisation scientist says the new BA.2 Omicron subvariant that is sweeping the world is equal to one of the most infectious diseases on Earth and that young people are playing Russian roulette by thinking they are ok to catch it (pictured, Revellers dancing at Universal Nightclub in Sydney)

Professor Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistican, said it was very likely all Australians would be at risk of catching BA.2 this year - especially since the end of restrictions such as social distancing and indoor mask mandates

While BA.2 is not as deadly as previous ones, including Delta, and not comparable to measles for severity, it is up to six times as infectious as the original strain of Covid-19

Can you catch the new Covid-19 variant if you are vaccinated? The BA.2 version of Omicron has an ability to 'evade' immunity, which includes vaccination. While vaccination provides a high level of protection from severe disease, it is less effective against preventing someone from catching Omicron at all. That even applies to boosters. Generally vaccines were more effective at preventing symptomatic infection from Delta than Omicron. For example, someone who had two shots in 2021 and a booster at the start of January would now have a 50 per cent chance of catching BA.2 if exposed. Advertisement

Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician, said it was very likely all Australians would be at risk of catching BA.2 this year - especially given the return of people to schools, offices and public transport.

'(At the moment) you are much more likely to get it; we're already seeing that with the case numbers going up,' he said.

Overall, case numbers Australia-wide are trending upwards.

NSW cases surged from 10,689 on Tuesday to 30,402 on Wednesday, though NSW Health attributed some of that increase to an additional 10,000 rapid tests in the system on Monday.

Of the 30,402 positive results, 22,748 were rapid antigen tests (RATs) and 7,654 were PCR lab tests.

But it is almost impossible to get an accurate picture of BA.2's spread because so many rapid tests are believed to be unreported.

The only objective, verifiable figures are the numbers of people in hospital with Covid.

On Tuesday, that figure was 1,801 Australia-wide; a total that has been relatively steady throughout March.

On January 25, there were 5,390.

While not everyone exposed to a virus is infected by it, BA.2's high 'basic reproduction number' or 'R0' of 12 - compared to 2.5 for the original Wuhan virus - could mean almost all Australians will come into contact with it in 2022.

The R0 is the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case; an R0 of 12 means up to 12 people could be infected by each case.

'Everyone's been exposed to Covid-19, full-stop, and unless you're very careful you will be exposed again this year,' Professor Esterman said.

'With face mask mandates being dropped, social distancing being removed, the chances are even higher.

'Those things are put in place to dampen down transmissibility, that's the whole point. When you remove them it's just increasing transmission.

'If you remove all of those protections, then your transmissibility almost gets back to the basic reduction number because we have very little immunity.'

While Omicron is generally less severe than the Delta strain, it is serious enough for some people that Professor Esterman likened wanting to catch Covid to gambling with your health.

'If you say ""I don't mind getting infected"" it's a bit like Russian roulette because you do have that chance of getting seriously ill or having long-term health problems.'

Mr Esterman, who is 73, admitted his own son argues 'it's no worse than the flu'.

'To a certain extent, he's right: the death rates not worse than seasonal flu,' he said.

One tragic case of a healthy young person dying from Covid was double-vaccinated power lifter James Kondilios, 23, who died at Sydney's St Vincent's hospital in January despite having no underlying health conditions

Professor Esterman believes a fourth jab should be introduced for vulnerable people in Australia

'The trouble is it causes more severe disease in vulnerable people than influenza, and it has the capacity to cause real damage to younger people too.

'There have been several cases of young, healthy and fit people dying from Covid. I cannot remember that ever happening with influenza.'

One was double-vaccinated power lifter James Kondilios, 23, who died with Covid at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital in January despite having no underlying health conditions.

Professor Esterman said while death rates have dropped to now be comparable to the flu, Covid is far more infectious and the spectrum of long-term health impacts is much wider.

'Covid-19 can attack every part of the body, from clotting to the heart and brain. There have even been cases of young children with multi-system inflammatory condition.'

Professor Esterman said it was 'very likely' people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome got it as an immune system response to a previous viral infection.

'These are the balance of risks individuals have to bear in mind.'

Professor Esterman also issued a warning that the pandemic is 'not over' and it's been 'sheer luck' that we are not in the middle of a wave that is both more infectious and deadlier

He pointed out that with six million reported deaths worldwide and 5,590 in Australia attributed to Covid-19, it was one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

Professor Esterman also issued a warning that the pandemic is 'not over' and it's been 'sheer luck' that we are not in the middle of a wave that is both more infectious and deadlier.

'It is true that pandemics become less infectious over time, but that happens over 100 years, not one year,' he said.

He described it as 'the toss of a coin' as to whether the next variant causes more severe illness.

'While it's true to say it's the beginning of the end, it's not the end yet,' he said.

Professor Esterman is an advocate of introducing a fourth dose for people at risk, who could include people with HIV/AIDs, kidney problems, diabetes, obesity and different cancers.

Despite warnings that even the triple vaccinated will be at greater risk of catching the new variant, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) is currently considering whether fourth doses should be rolled out and mandated, Health Minister Greg Hunt recently confirmed.",MailOnline,"['australia', 'esterman', 'wuhan', 'omicron', 'infectious', 'exposed', 'health', 'ba2', 'variant', 'covid', 'virus', 'delta', 'times', 'contagious', 'catching', 'risk', 'sweeping']",0
2022-03-15 16:43:07+00:00,8,"Pfizer has submitted data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin rolling out a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older.

The Washington Post reports that the company submitted data for the shot, which is a joint project with the German firm BioNTech, to regulators on Tuesday.

A fourth shot has been hinted at for months, and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla revealed during a television appearance last week that his company would soon submit its bid for a fourth shot.

While initial authorization would only apply to the elderly Americans, this would open the door to the fourth shot being made available to all U.S. adults at some point this year.

The Post also reports that authorization could come as early as Tuesday.

Pfizer has submitted an application to the FDA for a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older (file photo)

Vaccine uptake among Americans older than 65 has been really high, with nearly every elderly Americans having received at least one shot of the jab according to CDC data. Pictured: A man in New York City, New York, receives a shot of a COVID-19 vaccine

Currently, all Americans aged 12 or older are authorized for and recommended to receive a COVID-19 booster shot under FDA guidelines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends immunocompromised Americans receive a second booster, which would be a fourth dose for the vast majority of Americans who received one of the two-dose vaccine regimens, either the Pfizer or Moderna jabs.

Elderly Americans are also at significant risk from the virus, though, and being older than 65 is considered to be a risk factor by health officials.

The age cohort has also been eager to receive the shot, with the CDC reporting that almost every single American aged 65 or older has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.

'Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary, a fourth booster right now,' Bourla told CBS' Face the Nation over the weekend.

'The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths...it's not that good against infections but doesn't last very long.'

Pfizer reportedly included data from Israel as a part of its package sent to regulators Tuesday, as the Middle Eastern nation is one of few in the world which already allow for the oldest of residents to receive a second booster dose.

It is unlikely that the FDA will require an outside convening panel to discuss the matter, and the agency could even greenlight the additional shot as early as the same day data was submitted.

Health experts have warned that more Covid jabs will be on the way, and that they could remain a fixture in people's lives for years to come.

While the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna are not only safe, but also the most effective Covid shots on the market, they are not very durable.

Data from last year found that protection against infection for people who received the initial two-dose vaccine series waned after only five to six months.

It is believed that protection reestablished by the booster doses then wanes after three to four months, opening the need for a fourth.

Not all health officials agree that the strategy of repeated boosters being administered to control the virus is the correct way to handle the pandemic, though.

'With near- and medium-term supply of the available vaccines, the need for equity in access to vaccines across countries to achieve global public health goals, programmatic considerations including vaccine demand, and evolution of the virus, a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable,' a World Health Organization (WHO) work group said in January.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla (pictured) said over the weekend that it was absolutely necessary for Americans to receive a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose

The WHO, which has been critical of massive pharmaceutical companies like the New York City-based Pfizer during the rollout of the shots, wants the company to instead focus on developing more durable shots rather than repeatedly rolling out boosters for the foreseeable future.

While Israelis, and soon Americans and other people in the developed world, will have access to fourth doses, many people in the developing world - and especially in Africa - still have not received access to the initial vaccine regimen.

Alex Maitland, a senior advisor for Oxfam, a UK-based anti-poverty non-profit, described this as 'line skipping' during an interview with DailyMail.com earlier this month.

America and other rich countries are repeatedly purchasing Covid jabs and rolling them out to their populations.

Meanwhile, the virus will continue to spread abroad, causing more variants to form.

The developed countries can always just purchase more shots, though, limiting the effect the new strains will have on them while leaving the developing world behind.

There are not many incentives for Pfizer to back off of this strategy, though. The company projects $32 billion in revenue in vaccine sales alone this year, and the previously unheard of BioNTech has become one of the biggest firms in the German economy.

A fourth shot receiving approval this year, and being subsequently purchased by the U.S. government alongside others this year, will only lead to more revenue for the pharmaceutical giant.

Bourla has previously said on television that shots maty be needed for the next decade to continue to control the virus.

Many health experts predict that Covid will enter an endemic phase in the coming months, which will allow humans to live alongside the virus similar to how they live alongside the flu.

Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said earlier this month that she believes the virus will be seasonal, like the flu, with cases emerging during the fall and winter months every year.

Like the flu, an endemic Covid likely also means a yearly Covid jab will be required, with a new variant likely forming and taking over every year.

Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna - which is Pfizer's biggest competitor in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine shots - said earlier this year that a fourth shot will soon be needed as well, though he predicted it would come around the fall season.

Moderna is also working on a combined flu and Covid shot that people could receive in only one jab.",MailOnline,"['dose', 'receive', 'fourth', 'submits', 'vaccine', 'shots', 'shot', 'covid', 'virus', 'covid19', 'americans', 'older', 'pfizer', 'bid', 'fda']",0

'I've had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise,' the former president tweeted in describing his symptoms.

'Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It's a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven't already, even as cases go down,' Obama tweeted.

He did not mention whether either of his daughters Malia, 23, and Sasha, 20 were tested for the virus, but both are currently in college and likely away at school.

The diagnosis comes at a time when case rates and deaths in the U.S. are on the decline following the winter Omicron surge. It also comes as COVID restrictions are relaxing in the U.S.

Former President Barack Obama announced Sunday that he tested positive for COVID-19. Pictured: Obama speaks during a memorial service for the late Senator Harry Reid at The Smith Center for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 8, 2022

He posted on Twitter Sunday afternoon describing his symptoms as mild, and added that his wife Michelle Obama tested negative

There were still 38,482 new COVID-19 cases reported on Friday, according to the most recently available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Obama has been vaccinated for the last year.

He announced on Twitter in March 2021: 'Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it's the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again.'

'So I hope you'll get the vaccine as soon as it's available to you. It could save your life,' he added.

The announcement came at a time when many impatient Americans were anxious to get the vaccine after it rolled out, but also when the Biden administration was struggling to get vaccine-hesitant Americans to get the jab.

Obama's tweet featured a video showing him and wife Michelle receiving the vaccine along with former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and their wives, former first ladies Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush, respectively.

Infections massively spiked over the winter with the emergence of the highly-contagious Omicron variant, but case-rates are back down and have led to relaxed restrictions similar to those over the summer

In the video, which was developed by Ad Council and the COVID Collaborative and released on Wednesday, the former presidents urged Americans to receive their coronavirus vaccines to protect themselves against COVID-19 and hopefully put a stop to the ongoing pandemic.

'This vaccine means hope. It will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease,' Barack Obama said in the one-minute ad.

'We've lost enough people, and we've suffered enough damage,' Bill Clinton said.

Obama has faced criticism for his elitist lifestyle during COVID, including balking CDC guidelines in August of last year and hosting a large, glamorous and maskless 60th birthday bash at his home on Martha's Vineyard at a time when cases in Massachusetts were on the rise.

Massachusetts officials urged at the time that vaccinated residents and visitors put back on their face coverings in indoor public spaces amid a surge in new Covid cases after the mask guidelines were dropped earlier in the summer.

Guests at the event flew in from around the world to attend Obama's birthday weekend.

Well-wishes from lawmakers, global leaders and celebrities began pouring in within hours of the popular Democrat's announcement.

Among the most unexpected was GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wished Obama a 'speedy recovery' but then used her message to advocate against vaccine mandates.

'Wishing you a speedy recovery! After 2 yrs of Covid, the death rate is 1.2% & we know who is at higher risk of hospitalization or death. Thankfully 78,364,915 Americans have survived Covid. Vaccines should be a choice not a mandate, and natural immunity should be recognized,' Greene wrote on Twitter.

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on the other hand, praised Obama for using himself as an example to advocate for getting the jab.

Thousands of college students and party-goers have descended on Florida this week to celebrate what's expected to be the largest Spring Break ever, now free of COVID-19 restrictions.

While 2020 saw a dismal 1,500 people a day flying to Florida and 2021 saw a crowd of about 65,000 Spring Breakers, the Tampa Bay Times estimated that 570,000 students will be on holiday in the Sunshine State to party on the beaches this year.

The majority of Spring Breakers are estimated to come out this weekend, with Friday seeing sunny weather and temperatures in the low 80s. Saturday is expected to bring showers in the afternoon before fair weather returns on Sunday and Monday.

The most hectic period of Spring Break, which is expected to last until March 20, comes as six college students, five of whom are West Point cadets, overdosed on fentanyl-laced cocaine on Thursday.

Miami beaches were absolutely packed on Friday as throngs of students soaked up the sun and kicked off the weekend.

This year, Fort Lauderdale officials are readying themselves by enforcing safety measures into place before the expected arrival of Spring Breakers from all across the country, starting this weekend.

Police and fire rescue officials in Fort Lauderdale, often dubbed as 'Spring Break Central,' told reporters at a news conference on Friday that they expect to reach unprecedented levels since the coronavirus pandemic.

'We absolutely expect at least double if not triple what we saw last year as far as attendance,' Fort Lauderdale Police Maj. Bill Schultz told NBC Miami.

Schultz added that the city is already welcoming a good amount of 'early birds' and that it is ready to anticipate the arrival of many more partygoers over the next few weeks, starting with this upcoming weekend's surge.

AAA Tampa spokesman Mark Jenkins said that while AAA does not track Spring Break travel, the organization has seen an surge in travel for the event.

'People are feeling more confident about taking a trip and that's really what we're seeing on bookings,' Jenkins told ABC Tampa.

'AAA travel bookings right now are much stronger than they were this time last year so we're expecting a very strong Spring Break season,' Jenkins explained.

The upgraded security around tourist areas was key in the quick response after six students overdosed on cocaine laced with fentanyl on Thursday night, including five West Point cadets.

Two of the cadets had not ingested the drugs but were overcome by the effects of fentanyl when they attempted to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on their sickened friends, Orlando Sun-Sentinel first reported on Friday.

DailyMail.com reached to the U.S. Army Academy at West Point and was told by a representative that the college was 'aware' of the incident in Florida involving its students.

'The U.S. Military Academy is aware of the situation involving West Point cadets, which occurred Thursday night in Wilton Manors, FL,' a West Point spokesperson said in an email. 'The incident is currently under investigation and no other details are available at this time.'

News helicopter video shows paramedics converging on the front yard of a short-term vacation rental home on NW 29th Court in Wilton Manors, where multiple people were found in cardiac arrest at 5 p.m. Thursday.

Footage from the scene shows first responders administering first aid and placing several individuals onto stretchers.

Fort Lauderdale Fire Department Battalion Chief Steve Gollan told Local10 that two of the people who overdosed were sickened because they tried to perform CPR on the initial four overdose victims. He said the opioid-overdose-reversing drug naloxone, which is sold under the brand name Narcan, was administered to revive the victims.

Four of the patients were taken to Broward Health Medical Center, and the remaining two were transported to Holy Cross Hospital.

By Friday, one of the patients had been released from the hospital, two remained in critical condition after being intubated, and three were in stable condition.

A suspect believed to be connected to the incident was arrested in Florida, police confirmed to WSVN Friday night. It is also unclear if the suspect was staying at the rental property with the Spring Breakers.

Officials say four college students staying at a vacation rental home in Wilton Manors ingested the drug and went into cardiac arrest, and their two friends fell ill after coming into contact with the fentanyl by performing CPR on the patients

2022-03-08 02:00:05+00:00,19,"Covid can may be able to infect and damage a person's penis and testicles, a new study finds.

Researchers from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago, Illinois, found in a study of monkeys that the virus could infect the cells of male genitalia, and cause long-term harm.

Researchers found that COVID-19 infecting a person's penis, testicle and prostate cells can cause a variety of health issues

Previous research has found that male survivors of the virus sometimes suffer erectile dysfunction and other genital tract issues, though it is often believed to be a result of inflammation as an immune response to the virus.

These researchers now believe that it is the virus itself, not the immune system, causing genital issues for infected males, changing the calculous for how this type of condition would be treated.

Researchers, who posted their findings last week in bioRxiv pending peer review before journal publication, performed research on three male rhesus macaques, a breed of monkey often used for such studies because they have many genetic similarities with humans.

Each of the monkeys had body scans performed on them after they were infected with the virus in an effort to detect where traces of the virus were visible.

Dr Thomas Hope, lead researcher and a biology professor at Northwestern, told the New York Times that 'the signal in the penis was off the radar.'

Researchers found spread of the virus in the penis of all three animals. One of the animals had infection in its testicles as well.

The findings indicate that the virus managed to infect and spread within the monkey's penis, likely causing the animals genital tract issues, like erectile dysfunction.

The study was performed on male rhesus macaques (pictured), a type of monkey that has many genetic similarities to humans

Researchers believe this type of spread can cause major damage to the region of the body in both animals and humans.

Virus spread in the penis can cause erectile dysfunction and peyronie's disease, a condition where a person feels intense pain when they get an erection.

Covid spread in the prostate can lead to decreased semen quality and even put a person at a higher risk of developing prostate cancer.

In the testicles, the virus can decreases the count and quality of sperm and reduce testosterones levels.

An infected male may also feel inflammation or pain in their testicles.

Previous research has found a link between COVID-19 infection and the development of erectile dysfunction.

A study published last year by the University of Florida found that men who had recovered from the virus are three times more likely to develop the condition than those that had not.

Men with pre-existing risk factors like obesity, or a heart or respiratory condition showed an even higher rate of erectile dysfunction.

May have attributed this to inflammation as an immune response to the virus, which is the cause of many 'long Covid' symptoms - often placed under the umbrella of MIS-C.

In this case, though, the virus itself is binding itself to the body and causing long-term harm to those that it infects.

'The receptor that the coronavirus binds to is abundant on the penis and testes,' Dr Joseph Katz, a dentistry professor at the University of Florida that led last year's study, said.

'The virus can bind to those areas. And research has shown that COVID can reduce the amount of testosterone produced. The loss of testosterone has been shown to put someone at risk of having a more severe outcome from COVID-19.'",MailOnline,"['cells', 'animals', 'erectile', 'testicle', 'infect', 'study', 'male', 'spread', 'condition', 'potentially', 'cause', 'virus', 'penis', 'covid19', 'dysfunction', 'research']",0

The world reached a grim milestone on Monday morning, with the six millionth death caused by COVID-19 being recorded only days before the two year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the virus a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

America has suffered more deaths than anywhere else in the world, with 958,621 on the ledger according to data from Johns Hopkins University as of 9 a.m. Monday morning. Daily deaths are falling, though, and even as case figures hit record highs during this winter's Omicron surge, the number of Americans succumbing to the virus never reached the same heights.

The nation is recording 1,469 Covid deaths every day, a 16 percent drop over the past week. Cases have dropped sharply as well, down 30 percent over the past week to 47,376 per day - with the daily average dropping below 50,000 for the first time since July over the weekend.

While America has likely done well in recording Covid deaths over the past two years, with excess death figures nearly matching virus deaths, in many developing nations the number of people who have died from the virus has likely been undercounted. This means that the real global Covid death figure could be much higher than the reported six million.

California and Texas - the two most populous states in America - have recorded the most deaths, with just over 86,000 each according to official figures.

After adjusting for population figures, Mississippi has recorded the most deaths, with 408 per every 100,000 residents of the Magnolia state dying from the virus in the past two years.

It also has one of the nation's worst vaccination rates with only 51 percent of residents having received a full vaccine sequence.

For comparison, the two states with the lowest death rates are Hawaii (95 deaths per 100,000 residents) and Vermont (97). The former has had some of the strictest pandemic measures over the past two years, and its nature as an island state has given officials great control over who gets into the state.

Vermont has one of the highest vaccination rates in America with 80 percent of residents having received the jabs.

The U.S, just like much of the rest of the world, is starting to look beyond the pandemic as well. Covid-related masking, vaccine and social distancing mandates are starting to become a thing of the past in much of the country.

Even cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco that have had some of the strictest mandates budged in recent weeks.

Federal officials are starting to relax pandemic related orders as well, as the White House and other agencies lay out plans to move past the pandemic this year.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its metrics for determining Covid mask guidance two weeks ago, bringing the share of Americans under an indoor mask recommendation down from 95 percent to 30 percent - before dropping it once again to ten percent last week.

New figures now value hospitalizations strongly, as the CDC has accepted that infections are likely inevitable, even among the vaccinated. As long as case numbers are not translating into increased strain on the health care system, officials do not worry as much anymore.

The U.S. is currently averaging 39,000 people hospitalized with Covid every day, a 43 percent drop over the past two weeks. This figure is not quite reliable, though, as it included all people hospitalized while infected, even if they are being treated for another condition.

At his State of the Union address last week, President Joe Biden announced new plans for the U.S. to move forward and control the pandemic without the need for lockdowns or other potentially-destructive mandates.

Biden announced that the country had increased its purchase order of Pfizer's Paxlovid from 10 million to 20 million courses.

The drug, which received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration late last year, has been deemed as the most effective treatment post-infection but the company has reportedly had issues with production.

With production issues somewhat quelled, and the U.S. soon to have more access to the drug, Biden announced a 'Test to Treat' program.

Under the new system, any Americans can receive a Covid test at a pharmacy, and if they test positive they will be offered courses of Paxlovid for free.

Only pharmacy clinics will be allowed to distribute the drug, though, as the White House clarified Wednesday afternoon that a prescription would still be required. Pharmacists are not authorized to prescribe the drug.

The White House also announced that it would create a 'one stop' website where Americans could find information about the pandemic, along with putting more resources into the vaccine rollout, and increasing the nation's Covid test manufacturing capacity.

Plans going forward also include ramping up domestic production of tests, antivirals and masks, expanding access to public health resources and information and helping Americans manage 'long Covid' symptoms.

2022-03-07 18:12:34+00:00,27,"Covid can may be able to infect and damage a person's penis and testicles, a new study finds.

Researchers from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago, Illinois, found in a study of monkeys that the virus could infect the cells of male genitalia, and cause long-term harm.

Researchers found that COVID-19 infecting a person's penis, testicle and prostate cells can cause a variety of health issues

Previous research has found that male survivors of the virus sometimes suffer erectile dysfunction and other genital tract issues, though it is often believed to be a result of inflammation as an immune response to the virus.

These researchers now believe that it is the virus itself, not the immune system, causing genital issues for infected males, changing the calculous for how this type of condition would be treated.

Researchers, who posted their findings last week in bioRxiv pending peer review before journal publication, performed research on three male rhesus macaques, a breed of monkey often used for such studies because they have many genetic similarities with humans.

Each of the monkeys had body scans performed on them after they were infected with the virus in an effort to detect where traces of the virus were visible.

Dr Thomas Hope, lead researcher and a biology professor at Northwestern, told the New York Times that 'the signal in the penis was off the radar.'

Researchers found spread of the virus in the penis of all three animals. One of the animals had infection in its testicles as well.

The findings indicate that the virus managed to infect and spread within the monkey's penis, likely causing the animals genital tract issues, like erectile dysfunction.

The study was performed on male rhesus macaques (pictured), a type of monkey that has many genetic similarities to humans

Researchers believe this type of spread can cause major damage to the region of the body in both animals and humans.

Virus spread in the penis can cause erectile dysfunction and peyronie's disease, a condition where a person feels intense pain when they get an erection.

Covid spread in the prostate can lead to decreased semen quality and even put a person at a higher risk of developing prostate cancer.

In the testicles, the virus can decreases the count and quality of sperm and reduce testosterones levels.

An infected male may also feel inflammation or pain in their testicles.

Previous research has found a link between COVID-19 infection and the development of erectile dysfunction.

A study published last year by the University of Florida found that men who had recovered from the virus are three times more likely to develop the condition than those that had not.

Men with pre-existing risk factors like obesity, or a heart or respiratory condition showed an even higher rate of erectile dysfunction.

May have attributed this to inflammation as an immune response to the virus, which is the cause of many 'long Covid' symptoms - often placed under the umbrella of MIS-C.

In this case, though, the virus itself is binding itself to the body and causing long-term harm to those that it infects.

'The receptor that the coronavirus binds to is abundant on the penis and testes,' Dr Joseph Katz, a dentistry professor at the University of Florida that led last year's study, said.

'The virus can bind to those areas. And research has shown that COVID can reduce the amount of testosterone produced. The loss of testosterone has been shown to put someone at risk of having a more severe outcome from COVID-19.'",MailOnline,"['cells', 'animals', 'erectile', 'testicle', 'infect', 'study', 'male', 'spread', 'condition', 'potentially', 'cause', 'virus', 'penis', 'covid19', 'dysfunction', 'research']",0

2022-03-01 06:00:06+00:00,16,"Moderna is facing allegations of hijacking technology from two smaller biotech firms to produce its COVID-19 vaccine.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company is facing a lawsuit from Arbutus Biopharma and Genevant Sciences, both based in Vancouver, Canada, over allegations that is used lipid nanoparticle technology that infringed on the Canadian companies' patents.

Moderna's shot is the second most commonly used in the U.S., and has been a financial success for the previously low-profile biotech brand.

Earlier this month, CEO Stephane Bancel told investors that the company expects to rake in $19 billion in revenue in 2022 off of vaccine sales alone.

This is the second lawsuit Moderna is facing over its vaccine, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) also suing to have three of its scientists named as co-inventors of the vaccine after contributing to its creation.

Moderna is being sued by Arbutus Biopharma and Genevant Sciences, both from Vancouver, Canada, over allegations the company infringed on patents when making its COVID-19 vaccine (file photo)

The two companies allege that nanoparticle technology used by the Moderna vaccine belongs to them, and that the company knowingly used it without even requesting a licensing agreement (file photo)

'We seek fair compensation for Moderna’s use of our patented technology that was developed with great effort and at great expense, without which Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine would not have been successful,' William Collier, CEO of Arbutus, said in a statement.

Arbutus and Genevant have patented a 'breakthrough' lipid nanoparticle that gives the vaccine a protective coating it needs to function.

Messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines work by providing a person's body with an instruction kit to make an artificial spike protein. The immune system then activates to destroy that protein, and in the process builds Covid antibodies.

Without the nanoparticle, the companies filing suit allege, the vaccine would not have been discovered so quickly.

'It is well established in the scientific literature that the most significant technological hurdle to developing and deploying medicines using mRNA is engineering a safe and effective way to deliver the mRNA to human cells,' an Arbutus statement explains.

'Scientists at Arbutus and Genevant have spent years developing and refining lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technology, which has been licensed for various applications to many different third parties... with this technology, the RNA can travel through the human body to a target cell and through the target cell’s membrane before releasing the RNA.

'Without this crucial delivery technology, the RNA would quickly degrade in the body and be ineffective.'

In a complaint, Arbutus writes that Moderna knew that it was breaking the patent when it used the nanoparticle without licensing it.

They allege that 'attempted to invalidate several of the patents before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and when those efforts largely failed, Moderna simply used the patented technology without paying for it.'

Moderna made around $12 billion in profit in 2021, largely fueled by a successful rollout of Covid vaccines, and booster shots later in the year.

The company's shot has been administered 208 million times to fully vaccinate 75 million Americans and boost 40 million others.

It has more vaccine products on the way that should boost revenue figures this year - and in future years - as well.

Keeping the virus under control will likely require regular, potentially annual booster shots, similar to a yearly flu shot many Americans already receive.

Bancel said on an earnings calls earlier this month that he believes the next available Covid shot could become available during the fall, but said the U.S. government has not yet ordered a purchase of more jabs.

Moderna is also currently in Phase 2 of trials for its Omicron-tailored Covid jab. It is reportedly aiming to have the shot available to Americans late next month.

The company is also under fire from the federal government at the moment as it battles a lawsuit from the NIH.

The NIH claims that the creation of the vaccine was a collaborative project between the agency and Moderna, while Moderna declined to include three NIH scientists on its patent application for the mRNA sequence that forms the basis of the vaccine.

If the NIH were to win, the agency would be able to collect royalties on vaccine sales, and even license it to smaller, less developed, nations that have had trouble purchasing the vaccine from companies like Moderna.

This would hurt Moderna's market share - now competing with generics rather than just Pfizer and a few others in the international vaccine rollout - while also being a boon to much of the developed world.",MailOnline,"['moderna', 'nanoparticle', 'arbutus', 'mrna', 'accused', 'vaccine', 'used', 'hijacking', 'shot', 'technology', 'covid19', 'company', 'nih']",0

2022-02-25 05:46:02+00:00,10,"John Mayer announced on Thursday that he has tested positive for COVID-19, leading to the postponement of four shows.

The singer, 44, who battled the virus earlier this year, took to Instagram to announce the unfortunate news.

'Whelp. More members of the band tested positive for Covid today, and I was one of them,' he said. 'This means we have to reschedule the next four shows, which we've already rescheduled and posted above.'

The latest: John Mayer, 44, announced on Thursday that he has tested positive for COVID-19, leading to the postponement of four shows. He was snapped earlier this week playing at Madison Square Garden in NYC

The Waiting on the World to Change singer told fans impacted by the cancellations he was 'so sorry to make you change your plans.

'This is a bummer for everyone in the band and crew, to say nothing of the question hanging over everyone’s head - mine included - as to how I tested positive on PCR twice in two months,' Mayer said, adding that his first case 'was extremely mild, but this one’s got the better of me.'

The Daughters artist finished off his post in saying, 'We’ll give you everything we’ve got at these upcoming shows, just as soon as we rest up and regroup. With love and appreciation… me.'

Mayer adjusted the format of a show earlier this week at Madison Square Garden in New York City after drummer Steve Ferrone and background singer Carlos Ricketts tested positive for COVID-19, People reported. The guitarist took on an acoustic set and was joined by Questlove later in the concert.

Mayer on Wednesday played in Washington D.C. at the Capital One Arena with a sore throat, as he had a cup of tea by his side as he played an acoustic set, the outlet reported.

He told concertgoers: 'After the last two years, I am not canceling a show. We do not cancel shows here. I mean, if it's that thing and you've got it - well, I understand. Anything other than that ... if it's just me and I gotta bang on a guitar with my right hand and my left hand's in a sling and I tell you stories, I will not cancel a show.'

The musical artist said on Instagram Tuesday that the concert 'was another exercise in spirit and love' amid difficult circumstances.

'Big thanks to our old friend #JJJohnson for sitting in on drums to keep some the set feeling loud and proud,' he said. 'Thanks all for rolling with the punches. I’m more sure than ever that I have the greatest fans around.'

Mayer previously tested positive for COVID-19 in early January, as he had to bow out of a show at the Playing in the Sand festival in Mexico.

Mayer's Sob Rock tour is expected to return with a March 11 concert at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

Postponements of the next four shows include the February 25 concert in Pittsburgh being rescheduled to May 5; the March 1 concert in Belmont Park, New York being rescheduled to May 7; and the March 4 show to take place in Boston was rescheduled to a pair of shows on May 9 and 10.",MailOnline,"['second', 'singer', 'tests', 'postpones', 'john', 'tested', 'change', 'mayer', 'concert', 'positive', 'covid19', 'earlier', 'shows', 'rescheduled', 'told']",0
2022-02-25 04:00:09+00:00,21,"Canadian health officials have given approval to a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine, the first of its type.

Covifenz, developed as a joint-venture between Canada's Medicago and the UK's GlaxoSmithKline, uses plant material to mimic the virus's spike protein once injected into a person's body.

The shot received approval from Canadian regulators for use in residents aged 18 to 64 on Thursday.

It showed 71 percent effectiveness at preventing infection from Covid before Omicron, though trials were conducted before the rise of the variant late last year, meaning there is still no data for how effective the jab is against the dominant strain.

How much of a roll this shot will play in the country's vaccine rollout going forward in unknown, as Canada already has readily available access to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, among others.

Canada's Medicago has received approval for its plant-based COVID-19 vaccine, Covifenz, in its home nation. It if the first plant-based vaccine to receive authorization to fight Covid anywhere in the world (file photo)

The vaccine works by using plant particles to mimic the virus's spike protein, similar to how the mRNA vaccine uses its technology (file photo)

'The approval of our COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone for Canada in the fight against the pandemic' Takashi Nagao, president of Medicago, said in a statement.

The vaccine is a two-dose jab that is 'refrigerator stable', meaning it does not requires the hyper-cold storage that the Moderna and Pfizer shots do for transport.

Phase 3 trials for the shot included 24,000 adults in six countries. Not enough data for the over 65 age group was gathered for regulators to make a decision.

The jab works by using plant-based particles that can create a faux-spike protein the the body.

When the immune system ejects this protein, it will then create antibodies to fight the virus. This is also how the mRNA vaccines work.

National health officials are touting the vaccine as a way back into the biotechnology sphere for Canada, a nation they say has fallen behind.

'As one of our government's top priorities has been to reverse the 40-year decline faced by Canada's biomanufacturing sector, we are pleased to see Medicago's vaccine approval,' Francois-Philippe Champagne, a Canadian parliament member, said in a statement.

'It is a great milestone for Canada's biotechnology sector and for homegrown innovation.'

There are still questions to answer for the jab going forward, though, especially because other countries will not be as eager to grant approval to the shot out of a sense of national pride.

The vaccine is effective against the Delta variant and other previous strains of Covid, but many of those have all but vanished in recent months.

Omicron is the most infectious version of Covid yet, and combined with its even more infectious BA.2 lineage, other strains of the virus have been pushed into obscurity.

It is the most mutated strain yet as well, and it has so many changes from other versions of Covid that it can evade protection provided by the Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and other vaccines made for older virus strains.

While booster shots have proved to be effective at shoring up protection for the other shots, Covifenz does not yet have an approved booster.

The shot will have some competition as well. Novavax's protein shot, which could be the most effective and durable yet, has begun its global rollout and will likely be available in America soon as well.

Glaxo also has a protein based vaccine, a joint venture with French pharma giant Sanofi, seeking authorization from U.S. officials.

Both of the shots have demonstrated effectiveness against Omicron in lab trials, and protein based shots can also be stored at fridge temperatures, removing a potential advantage the Canadian shot may have.

Canada also already has five other approved vaccines, and has purchase contracts in place with Pfizer and Moderna to buy Covid vaccines and booster shots from the companies at least through next year.",MailOnline,"['approval', 'officials', 'based', 'vaccines', 'moderna', 'jab', 'health', 'plant', 'protein', 'vaccine', 'shots', 'shot', 'covid', 'covid19', 'plantbased', 'greenlight', 'canadian']",0
2022-02-18 20:03:04+00:00,10,"A seven-year-old girl from Knoxville, Tennessee, has died three days after contracting COVID-19, after the virus triggered a rare autoimmune disorder that caused her heart and brain to swell.

Jennifer and Adam Graviss said their daughter Adalyn came down with a fever on February 4, and an at-home COVID test came back positive.

But they told Good Morning America that she appeared to feel fine over the next day and a half, and even went outside to play on February 5.

However, that night she suddenly became 'lethargic' and struggled to walk and speak, so they rushed her to the hospital - where doctors discovered swelling in her brain and heart.

On February 7, less than 72 hours after her positive test, Adalyn - who had recently been so excited to become a big sister - passed away.

'It was just so fast. Hours before going to the hospital, she was running in the front yard,' said her dad, Adam.

Jennifer and Adam Graviss said their daughter Adalyn came down with a fever on February 4, and an at-home COVID test came back positive

But she appeared to feel fine over the next day and a half, and even went outside to play on February 5

Adalyn was taken to Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt in Nashville and put on an ECMO machine, which helps add oxygen to the blood when the lungs aren't working.

Doctors performed an MRI and discovered 'little clots' and 'swelling in her brain,' which they believed were caused by a very rare autoimmune disease that trigged a 'severe neurological response' to COVID, Jennifer explained on Facebook.

'They are starting her on IVIG, steroids, blood thinners, and possibly plasmphoresis. This is going to be a long haul,' her mom wrote.

'She needs a miracle. We need our girl to wake up! We need our God to heal our sweet baby so she can come home.'

According to GMA, the little girl was diagnosed with myocarditis, a swelling of the heart. She was also diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an immune system disorder that is triggered by viral infections and causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

NBC reported last year that there have been dozens of case reports since the pandemic started linking COVID-19 as the trigger for ADEM.

At first she started to improve, but then, things 'took a turn for the worst,' her dad said, and she tragically passed away on February 7, less than three days since she tested positive for COVID.

Jennifer and Adam said that Adalyn had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, since she only recently became eligible and they were still considering it.

But her parents insisted that they were all 'very cautious,' especially since Jennifer had just given birth to their second daughter, Ella, on January 28.

'If a kid was coughing she would ask to be moved because she didn't want baby Ella to get it,' she said.

Jennifer said that Adalyn had been so excited to become a big sister, and that she would wake up early before school every morning so that she had extra time with the newborn.

She said: 'She waited for years to be a big sister. Every night she would pray for God to give her a baby to be a big sister, and that's what we're so thankful for, that she was able to experience that for five days.

'She would just sing to her and she would sit there and tell her stories like, ""I'm going to be your best friend. Sissy's going to show you so much, how to dance and how to play basketball and as soon as you're big enough, we're going to church."" She just wanted to be with the baby all the time.'

Adam added: 'Ella's going to have the coolest guardian angel looking over her, protecting her.'

Jennifer said Adalyn, who loved playing basketball, dancing, and going to church, had the 'biggest heart.'

'She loved her friends. She hugged teachers that weren't even her teacher every morning,' she recalled.

'She would stop by the [school] office and give an update every day about baby Ella.

According to her mom, Adalyn's most special relationship was with her dad. 'They were best buds,' she gushed

'She was just really fun, and we just took her everywhere. That's what makes it so hard. She was our best friend,' her dad added

'We did everything with her, everything she wanted to do, from going to Disney World to playing basketball in the driveway in the dark to playing UNOs tournaments every night. She was just a happy girl.'

But according to her mom, Adalyn's most special relationship was with her dad.

2022-02-11 19:07:40+00:00,10,"The application for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be used in children aged six months to four years old has been delayed, the Food and Drug Administration announced Friday.

The company submitted the emergency use authorization application on February 1. It included data from the first two doses of the three-dose vaccine set to be used in younger children. A FDA advisory committee panel meeting to discuss the merits of the approval was scheduled for February 15

Data for a third shot was supposed to come in later, and the New York City based company planned to apply for authorization for the third shot at another time.

The FDA said Friday it was notified by Pfizer that the company had new data regarding the shot that was worthy of being included in the decision making process.

As a result, the February 15 meeting has been pushed back to an unknown date.

Despite the push from regulators to expand eligibility for the shots to include young children, the controversial move would make the U.S. the only nation to jab children under one years old for Covid.

Pfizer has delayed its application for its COVID-19 vaccine to be used in children aged six months to 5 years old (file photo)

'The [FDA] has been notified by Pfizer that new data have recently emerged regarding its emergency use authorization request for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in children 6 months through 4 years of age,' a statement from the agency said.

'Based on the agency’s preliminary assessment, and to allow more time to evaluate additional data, we believe additional information regarding the ongoing evaluation of a third dose should be considered as part of our decision-making for potential authorization.'

A new time for the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting has not yet been scheduled.

Unlike the two-dose shot used for people aged five and older, Pfizer's shot for children aged six months to five years old is three shots.

The jab is significantly smaller as well, only three micrograms, compared to a ten microgram shot for children five to 12 and a 30 microgram shot for people 12 and up.

Pfizer initially only planned to have the two smaller doses for young children, though plans had to be changed in December after children aged three and four showed little antibody response to the first two, smaller, shots.

The FDA reportedly asked Pfizer to submit its application at the start of the month, citing a rise in pediatric Covid cases during the Omicron surge.

Trials for the third shot were not yet completed yet, though, so the first application only included the first two jabs - with a third to come later.

'Given the recent omicron surge and the notable increase in hospitalizations in the youngest children to their highest levels during the pandemic so far, we felt it was our responsibility as a public health agency to act with urgency and consider all available options, including requesting that the company provide us with initial data on two doses from its ongoing study,' the agency wrote in a statement.

'The goal was to understand if two doses would provide sufficient protection to move forward with authorizing the use of the vaccine in this age group.'

Not all experts agree the shot is necessary, though.

Dr Cody Meissner, the chief of pediatrics at Tufts Children's Hospital in Boston and a member of the VRBPAC, doubted whether the vaccine is needed for group which already suffers such low risk of hospitalization or death from Covid.

'I think we're rethinking the way we looked at this question, because even though people are appropriately vaccinated they are still able to become infected and transmit the virus to susceptible people around them,' Meissner told DailyMail.com on February 1.

'So this is a little bit different than many other infectious diseases such as measles, or mumps, or rubella. If you're protected from infection with the vaccine, then you're not going to transmit it to other people.'

'But that's not the same setting with [this virus].'

He noted that deaths among young children from Covid have remained very low. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, young children make up less than 0.1 percent of Covid deaths in America.

A study from last year performed by researchers at the University of Utah found that 50 percent of youth Covid cases are asymptomatic - and that was before the more mild Omicron variant emerged.

The move would make the U.S. the country with the youngest minimum vaccination age.

Only two other nations, Venezuela and Cuba, jab children as young as two, and four others - Bahrain, China, Chile and the United Arab Emirates - jab kids as young as three.

None of the countries use the Pfizer vaccine on children, with all opting for either China's Sinopharm shot or the Cuban Soberena vaccine.

Meissner says he would agree with use of the vaccines in younger children if it was done the way that countries like the UK and Sweden approved the shots for the five to 11 age group.

In those countries, an average, healthy, child is not eligible for the shot. If they have a condition that puts them at serious risk from the virus, though, then they are allowed to get it as an extra level of protection.

Outside of children with serious comorbidities, he does not think there is a basis to approve the jab in the younger age group, and he especially fears green-lighting the shot will open the door for preschools and other facilities to institute vaccine mandates for young kids.

'If people are really going to follow the facts, and follow the science, which everybody claims they're doing ... they come to the opposite conclusion,' he said.

'The burden of disease in children under five years of age is so low.'

Meissner said that, more than anything, he does not want their to be any 'surprises' in how the shot can effect children - similar to how officials were blindsided by the discovery that the J&J vaccine causes blood clots in some young women.

Myocarditis, heart inflammation, has been a concern for younger, male, recipients of these mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's and Moderna's as well.

'We don't have any experience with these [mRNA] vaccines in young children ... I'm very hopeful that they will turn out to be equally safe and equally effective [as they were for adults], but we don't know that,' he said.",MailOnline,"['young', 'data', 'age', 'aged', 'application', 'old', 'younger', 'vaccine', 'shot', 'months', 'delays', 'covid19', 'pfizer', 'jab', 'fda', 'children']",0

The Spanish royal household said King Felipe's 'overall health' was fine and he will remain in isolation for seven days, following national health protocols.

The royal house confirmed on Wednesday that Queen Letizia has not shown any symptoms of the virus.

With 90 per cent of its population over age 12 years old having received at least two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, Spain is starting to roll back health restrictions as the latest surge driven by the omicron variant ebbs.

The new Proton Therapy Centre is equipped with cutting-edge technology and will research improvement in cancer treatment results and the quality of life of patients, through its projects.

2022-02-10 07:20:05+00:00,30,"Scientists have found traces of coronavirus that could bolster the theory that the pandemic began with a leak from a laboratory.

The discovery, from analysis of soil samples, suggests coronavirus may not have jumped from wildlife into humans naturally.

More evidence is needed, however, particularly relating to exactly when the virus entered the samples.

Scientists have found traces of coronavirus that could bolster the theory that the pandemic began with a leak from a laboratory (file photo used)

Scientists in Hungary found traces of a unique variant of coronavirus while examining DNA from soil from Antarctica that had been sent to the firm Sangon Biotech in Shanghai.

The researchers also found genetic material from Chinese hamsters and green monkeys, which may suggest the virus was being examined in a lab, using either the animals themselves or their cells.

Some of those who support the lab leak theory suggest Chinese scientists engineered the virus in a lab to make it more dangerous as part of an experiment, before the virus escaped.

Viscount Ridley, author of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19, suggested the latest evidence may support the lab leak theory due to the presence of 'three key [Covid] mutations' that are characteristic of the earliest sequences of the virus.

The discovery, from analysis of soil samples, suggests coronavirus may not have jumped from wildlife into humans naturally (file photo used)

However, the findings must be interpreted with caution, as the soil DNA may have been contaminated with the virus by the first Covid patients, who were reported by China in December 2019.

The soil samples were sent in the same month to Sangon Biotech but it is not clear when they were analysed.

The findings, from Eotvos Lorand University and the University of Veterinary Medicine, both in Budapest, have been published online but not yet formally reviewed by other scientists.

Professor Jesse Bloom, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle in the US, re-ran the data from Hungary to confirm that the Antarctic samples did contain the virus.

2022-02-07 07:00:06+00:00,3,"New York - which was once the epicenter of the Omicron surge - recorded its lowest positivity rate since the COVID variant was first detected in December as hospitalizations continue to fall.

On Sunday, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state's positivity rate is just 3.52 percent, and new cases are down 75 percent compared to two weeks ago - with just 5,680 new positive COVID cases reported the day before.

The number of patients admitted to one of New York's many hospitals has also plummeted, with 558 new patients admitted on Saturday and just 68 new deaths.

'I’m so proud of the work New Yorkers have put in to fight this winter surge,' Hochul said in a statement Sunday. 'The trends continue to be promising, but it is important we continue to be vigilant so we can keep positivity rates low.'

As of Saturday, 80.4 percent of New York residents have had at least one vaccine, and 72.2 percent are fully vaccinated.

But many New Yorkers have grown weary with pandemic-related restrictions, with a new study showing that fewer Big Apple residents report wearing masks at all times - even as New York City remains the epicenter of the state's COVID pandemic.

The city recorded 2,174 of the 5,680 new cases on Saturday, according to New York State health data, or about 38 percent.

New York on Sunday recorded its lowest positivity rate since the Omicron surge first began at the end of December - at just 3.52 percent, with 5,680 new positive COVID cases reported

New York City officials are now beginning to prepare for another possible COVID surge or pandemic with a COVID Recovery Task Force.

On Sunday, Huge Ma, who became known as 'Vax Daddy' for creating a website that helped New Yorkers find vaccination appointments, and Dr. Jay Varma, who served as a senior adviser to former Mayor Bill de Blasio announced they were joining the task force, set up by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine.

'We need to prepare and assume that the virus will continue to potentially throw curveballs at us,' Varma told the New York Daily News. 'Or if it isn't this virus, there may be another one in the future.'

'Whatever investments we make in preparedness will yield dividends in the future,' he said, adding: 'We should be thinking about what the measures might be. Those could be anywhere from technical guidance about how to improve ventilation in indoor facilities or ... debating what the value is of certain regulations.

'We want to start thinking about how the systems can be ready, so we can just flip the switch when we're in the midst of a future wave of COVID or another pandemic.'

Meanwhile, fewer New York City residents report wearing masks this year than last year, according to a new survey of 2,500 respondents from the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health.

It found that in January 2021, 80 percent of respondents reported that they always wore a mask in public, but in the most recent survey, conducted from January 28 to January 30 by Consensus Strategies, only 72 percent said the same.

More than half of Big Apple residents have applied for the federal government's at-home testing kits after weeks of long lines outside of testing centers. A man is seen here getting tested ahead of the holiday season on December 19

At the same time, the poll found that more than half of Big Apple residents have already applied for the federal government's at-home testing kits.

About 30 percent of those who said they applied for the set of four at-home testing kits the Biden administration announced last month it would deliver to every household said they wanted to use it in case they start developing COVID symptoms, and 25 percent said they wanted to have the tests available in case they need it.

Another 18 percent of respondents said they wanted to self-test before they get together with friends and family after the city saw long lines outside of COVID testing centers for weeks amid the omicron surge and holiday season.

Of those who ordered the test, the poll found, two-thirds had received a COVID vaccine booster and only about one-third of unvaccinated respondents said they ordered the at-home tests.

'This is an indication of the vigilance of vaccinated individuals in containing the spread,' Dr. Ayman El-Mohandes, dean of CUNY Graduate School of Public Health told the New York Post, adding that it is 'disappointing' that so many unvaccinated people had not applied for the free tests.

'It's a shame that so many among us who are not vaccinated would be resistant to getting the COVID test,' he said. 'They should be more willing to get tested to contain the virus, not less.'

Still, COVID seems to be waning nationwide - even as deaths throughout the country increase.

On Sunday, federal officials reported that the average daily confirmed COVID cases is half of what was reported less than two weeks ago and down from the peak of nearly 806,000 infections a day on January 15.

But at the same time, the US reported 902,266 coronavirus deaths, an increase of 875, and a seven-day average of 2,455, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins.

The US tally marks an increase of more than 100,000 fatalities nationwide since Dec. 12, coinciding with a surge of infections and hospitalizations driven by the Omicron variant.

Analysts with Reuters allege the US death tally is the highest number of COVID fatalities reported by any nation, followed by Russia, Brazil and India with more than 1.8 million deaths combined. In terms of coronavirus fatalities per capita, the United States ranks 20th, well below the top two - Peru and Russia.

Now, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will no longer requiring hospital systems to report daily COVID-19 deaths to the federal government.

The policy change, which was announced in January, went into effect last Wednesday, just days ahead of the US death toll surpassing 900,000.

Some health officials are calling the move 'incomprehensible,' alleging the hospital data has, over the last two years, 'changed the response to the pandemic for the better'.

'The hospitals have been doing this for going on two years,' a federal health official told WSWS, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

'It is the only consistent, reliable and actionable dataset at the federal level. Ninety-nine percent of hospitals report one hundred percent of the data every day.'

Although hospitals will no longer need to report the previous day's COVID-19 deaths to the federal government each day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will continue to collect and report COVID data from official death certificates.

The CDC also notes the death data reported by hospitals to the HHS 'is not a CDC-owned data source and does not impact our reporting'.

The organization instead compiles its numbers from death certificate reports sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), with officials reiterating 'there have been no changes to CDC data sources.'",MailOnline,"['35', 'rate', 'data', 'report', 'omicron', 'positivity', 'deaths', 'health', 'surge', 'york', 'records', 'start', 'covid', 'city', 'federal', 'lowest', 'reported']",0

2022-01-31 22:50:04+00:00,4,"Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine has received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults in the U.S., the company announced Monday.

Spikevax, as it has been named, is the second Covid vaccine to receive full approval from the FDA, joining Pfizer's Comirnaty. It was previously used on an emergency use authorization basis.

Full approval means the shot will still be available for use once the Covid-related state of emergency ends - which could be sometime this year. It also means the shot is being given an official stamp of approval from regulators that it is safe and effective over a long period of time.

The shot is among the most effective in the world against the virus and is the second most commonly used shot in the U.S.

It has been used to fully vaccinate 204 million Americans, and has been used as a booster shot 38.4 million times.

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has received full approval for use in adults from the FDA. It is the second vaccine to receive approval in the U.S., joining the Pfizer show (file photo)

'Our COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to hundreds of millions of people around the world, protecting people from COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death,' Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.

'The full licensure of Spikevax in the U.S. now joins that in Canada, Japan, the European Union, the UK, Israel, and other countries, where the adolescent indication is also approved.'

The FDA decision was based on a Phase 3 study using data from real world recipients of the vaccine while it was in its emergency use phase.

Only the first two shots of Moderna's vaccine have received approval, and the booster shot remains available of the emergency use basis only.

The company also plans to release an Omicron-specific shot in the near future that will become available under emergency use authorization as well.

'The FDA's approval of (the vaccine) is a significant step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the second vaccine approved to prevent COVID-19,' FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement.

The initial regimen received its first authorization in December 2020, shortly after Pfizer's shot did.

The one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine still has not received FDA approval, and has been phased out by some vaccine providers due to its lower efficacy and durability compared to its peers.

Approval for the Moderna shot comes as Covid cases are starting to fall nationwide, with some already looking forward to life post-pandemic.

The U.S. has recorded a 28 percent drop in daily cases over the past seven days, with states along the east coast that were hard struck by Omicron now recording sharp case declines.

This signals that the pandemic may end, and with it, pandemic related emergency declarations as well.

Because the Moderna vaccine was previously only approved on the basis of the pandemic-related emergency, it would become unavailable should the pandemic end.

With this new approval, though, it is now permanently approved for use across the United States.

'Safe and effective vaccines are our best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic, including currently circulating variants,' Dr Peter Marks, one of the FDA's top vaccine regulators, said.

Chad Carswell, 38, strongly believes that getting the vaccine should be a choice and doesn't think it's very effective in preventing infection.

'I've had COVD twice so I've developed natural antibodies,' the Air Force veteran told DailyMail.com on Sunday when asked about his reasons for refusing the shot.

'A lot of scientists say I'm more safe from my natural antibodies. It's more to do with the fact that they're trying to force you to do something,' he said.

Carswell has had six heart attacks and is a double amputee. His kidney is operating at four percent capacity and he undergoes dialysis - a process that removes toxins from the blood, typically removed by healthy kidneys - three times a week.

About 100 people have offered to donate a kidney to him, he said, but he can't get a transplant at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem, which requires transplant candidates to be vaccinated because they are at high risk for severe illness.

'Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist's policy follows the current standard of care in the United States, which is to vaccinate all patients on waiting lists or being evaluated for transplant,' the hospital said in a statement.

Carswell's case echoes the travails faced by a gravely ill 31-year-old father-of-two in Massachusetts who was taken off the donor list for a heart transplant by a Boston hospital because he 'does not believe' in the COVID vaccine.

Carswell is on disability and dabbles in real estate and in buying and selling cars. He is a former member of the Air Force and was a general manager at a car dealership before his kidney failure got worse.

Asked about his health, Carswell told DailyMail.com: 'I'm still here so that's really all that matters.'

He said he undergoes dialysis Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

'Those days are pretty tough,' he said. 'It's getting harder. Those days are getting longer. I get it first thing in the morning. I used to come home and take a rest and have time in the afternoon to function and do stuff, and now those days are pretty much washed.'

Carswell appears to have had COVID in September.

'As soon as they did an X-ray of my chest he came in and told me it’s in bad shape that he’s really worried about me,' he said in a Facebook post from a hospital bed.

In November, he posted a photo of three tubes of the veterinary formulation of Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug used in humans and animals in different doses.

He insisted he's not changing his mind about the COVID-19 vaccine anytime soon.

The US Centers for Disease Control maintains that all three vaccines approved in the US are safe and effective and that everyone aged 5 and up should get one 'as soon as possible.'

'A lot of people think I'm anti-vax. I'm not anti-vax. I'm I-don't-care-vax,' Carswell told DailyMail.com. 'If you choose to get it, by all means, get it. If you choose to not get it, by all means, don't get it.'

Carswell said friends and local businesses raised money to fund his much-needed transplant, and that more than 100 people offered to donate one of their kidneys, according to WSCO.

Doctors and nurses at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist have urged him to get the vaccine so he can get the surgery.

'That's when I politely told him there’s nothing to talk about,' Carswell said. 'It wasn't up for debate, I wasn't getting it. And he told me, ""You know you'll die if you don't get it,"" and I told him I'm willing to die,' he told WSCO.

He added: 'I was born free. I will die free. I'm not changing my mind.'

Carswell told DailyMail.com that Dr. Bob Stratta, who oversees the transplant team at Atrium Health, actually agreed with his reasons for not getting the vaccine.

'He called me and said that I was a very intelligent man and that the reasonings that I had for not agreeing with everything, he agreed with 100 percent, and that if it were up to him, he would allow me to get it,' he said.

Dr. Stratta did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com.

COVID-19, powered by the Omicron variant, is driving the daily American death toll higher than during last autumn's Delta wave, with deaths likely to keep rising for days or even weeks.

In total there are 74,086,874 cases in the US as of Friday and 882,970 deaths.

The seven-day rolling average for daily new COVID-19 deaths in the US has been climbing since mid-November, reaching 2,390 on Friday and surpassing a September peak of 2,100 when Delta was the dominant variant.

Now Omicron is estimated to account for nearly all the virus circulating in the nation.

And even though it causes less severe disease for most people, the fact that it is more transmissible means more people are falling ill and dying.

US COVID deaths and infections are still up due to the more contagious Omicron variant

Carswell says he's looking into other hospitals for his transplant, but new rules requiring transplant candidates to get jabbed are popping up everywhere.

'I've been told there’s one in Texas and one in Florida, and then I got told that one in Florida changed their policy last week,' he told DailyMail.com.

'I've been told multiple times there was one in Texas that doesn't and then I got told there was one in Nebraska that doesn't.'

Carswell says his mom, dad, brother and close friends support his decision to remain unvaccinated.

He says his religion keeps him motivated to stand his ground.

Last week, DJ Ferguson, who has a hereditary heart condition that causes his lungs and heart to fill with blood and fluid, was denied the life-saving heart transplant by Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.

DJ Ferguson, 31 (pictured) has a hereditary heart condition that causes his lungs and heart to fill with blood and fluid without intervention from intravenous medication. He has been denied a life-saving heart transplant because he refuses to get vaccinated against COVID-19

Ferguson's family is considering moving him to another hospital, but he may not be able to be moved in his condition

The hospital said it removed Ferguson from the donor list because all transplant recipients need to get the vaccine in order to 'create both the best chance for successful operation and also the patient’s survival after transplantation.'

However, Ferguson's father, David, said getting vaccinated is 'kind of against his basic principles' and that his son 'doesn't believe in it.'

'I think my boy is fighting pretty damn courageously and he has integrity and principles he really believes in and that makes me respect him all the more... It’s his body. It’s his choice.'

The hospital, which has a list of protocols for transplant candidates that includes a ban on lifestyle choices like smoking and alcohol, said requiring the COVID vaccine is common at many medical center's throughout the country.

The mortality rate for transplant recipients who fall ill with COVID is more than 20 percent, according to UCHealth.

2022-01-31 16:25:32+00:00,9,"Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine has received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults in the U.S., the company announced Monday.

Spikevax, as it has been named, is the second Covid vaccine to receive full approval from the FDA, joining Pfizer's Comirnaty. It was previously used on an emergency use authorization basis.

Full approval means the shot will still be available for use once the Covid-related state of emergency ends - which could be sometime this year. It also means the shot is being given an official stamp of approval from regulators that it is safe and effective over a long period of time.

The shot is among the most effective in the world against the virus and is the second most commonly used shot in the U.S.

It has been used to fully vaccinate 204 million Americans, and has been used as a booster shot 38.4 million times.

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has received full approval for use in adults from the FDA. It is the second vaccine to receive approval in the U.S., joining the Pfizer show (file photo)

'Our COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to hundreds of millions of people around the world, protecting people from COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death,' Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.

'The full licensure of Spikevax in the U.S. now joins that in Canada, Japan, the European Union, the UK, Israel, and other countries, where the adolescent indication is also approved.'

The FDA decision was based on a Phase 3 study using data from real world recipients of the vaccine while it was in its emergency use phase.

Only the first two shots of Moderna's vaccine have received approval, and the booster shot remains available of the emergency use basis only.

The company also plans to release an Omicron-specific shot in the near future that will become available under emergency use authorization as well.

'The FDA's approval of (the vaccine) is a significant step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the second vaccine approved to prevent COVID-19,' FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement.

The initial regimen received its first authorization in December 2020, shortly after Pfizer's shot did.

The one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine still has not received FDA approval, and has been phased out by some vaccine providers due to its lower efficacy and durability compared to its peers.

Approval for the Moderna shot comes as Covid cases are starting to fall nationwide, with some already looking forward to life post-pandemic.

The U.S. has recorded a 28 percent drop in daily cases over the past seven days, with states along the east coast that were hard struck by Omicron now recording sharp case declines.

This signals that the pandemic may end, and with it, pandemic related emergency declarations as well.

Because the Moderna vaccine was previously only approved on the basis of the pandemic-related emergency, it would become unavailable should the pandemic end.

With this new approval, though, it is now permanently approved for use across the United States.

'Safe and effective vaccines are our best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic, including currently circulating variants,' Dr Peter Marks, one of the FDA's top vaccine regulators, said.

2022-01-29 12:16:02+00:00,3,"Republican Senator Mitt Romney has tested positive for COVID-19 and will isolate and work remotely, his office has confirmed, adding that the 74-year-old is not showing any symptoms.

Romney, who was governor of Massachusetts before running for president in 2012, unsuccessfully challenging Barack Obama, is currently a senator for Utah.

His wife Ann, 72, has tested negative, Romney's office said.

'Senator Romney tested positive today for COVID-19. He is currently asymptomatic and will be isolating and working remotely for the recommended period of time,' they said in a statement.

'Mrs. Romney has tested negative.

'Both Senator and Mrs. Romney have been fully vaccinated and boosted against the virus.'

Mitt Romney, pictured on December 8, has tested positive for COVID, his office said on Friday

Romney is pictured with his wife Ann, arriving for the funeral of Senator John McCain in September 2018. Romney challenged McCain for the 2008 Republican nomination in the presidential election

In May 2020, doctors directed both Romney and Mike Lee, his fellow Utah senator, to self-quarantine after being around Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tested positive for COVID-19.

Romney, who said he did not experience any symptoms, tested negative for the virus at that time.

Earlier this month, Romney criticized the Biden administration for not doing enough to supply sufficient COVID tests. He said that he himself was frequently tested, and thought everyone should have access to the tests.

'I think, unfortunately, the administration was wrong in not building testing capacity at a time when we all thought COVID was going away,' he said in a Senate hearing.

'I think a lot of individuals, myself included, get tested when there's no indication that I need to get tested, other than to just want to make sure I'm not sick.

'There's huge demand for tests which are in short supply, in part because of that.'

Romney's infection comes after that of Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, who on Monday tested positive multiple times.

On Tuesday night and on Wednesday night, she defied scientific recommendations to eat out at Manhattan restaurants, despite being infected.

She is unvaccinated.

The Omicron coronavirus variant is driving the daily American death toll higher than during last autumn's Delta wave, with deaths likely to keep rising for days or even weeks.

The seven-day rolling average for daily new COVID-19 deaths in the US has been climbing since mid-November, reaching 2,267 on Thursday and surpassing a September peak of 2,100 when Delta was the dominant variant.

Now Omicron is estimated to account for nearly all the virus circulating in the nation.

And even though it causes less severe disease for most people, the fact that it is more transmissible means more people are falling ill and dying.

'Omicron will push us over a million deaths,' said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine.

'That will cause a lot of soul searching. There will be a lot of discussion about what we could have done differently, how many of the deaths were preventable.'

Omicron symptoms are often milder, and some infected people show no symptoms, researchers agree.

But like the flu, it can be deadly, especially for people who are older, have other health problems or who are unvaccinated.

'Importantly, 'milder' does not mean 'mild',' said Dr Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during a White House briefing.

At one hospital in Kansas, 50 COVID-19 patients have died this month and more than 200 are being treated.

University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, posted a video from its morgue showing bagged bodies in a refrigeration unit and a worker marking one white body bag with the word 'COVID'.

'This is real,' said Ciara Wright, the hospital's decedent affairs coordinator.

'Our concerns are, 'Are the funeral homes going to come fast enough?' We do have access to a refrigerated truck. We don't want to use it if we don't have to.'

Dr Katie Dennis, a pathologist who does autopsies for the health system, said the morgue has been at or above capacity almost every day in January, 'which is definitely unusual'.

With more than 882,000 deaths, the United States has the largest COVID-19 toll of any nation.

During the coming week, almost every US state will see a faster increase in deaths, although deaths have peaked in a few states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Maryland, Alaska and Georgia, according to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.

New hospital admissions have started to fall for all age groups, according to CDC data, and a drop in deaths is expected to follow.

'In a pre-pandemic world, during some flu seasons, we see 10,000 or 15,000 deaths,' said Nicholas Reich, who aggregates coronavirus projections for the hub in collaboration with the CDC.

2022-01-28 08:26:19+00:00,16,"Kiwis have been so surprised about Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's new Covid-19 home isolation rules that some thought it was a bad joke.

Earlier this week, the New Zealand government issued instructions saying 'household close contacts' of a positive Covid case must isolate for up to 24 days - even if they do not have the virus.

This means that household contacts are required to isolate longer than the actual case themselves, which only has to isolate for 14 days.

'The isolation period for Covid-19 cases in the community is at least 14 days, including 72 hours symptom-free,' the instructions say.

'Your household members will need to remain in isolation for at least 10 days after you have been released as a case. This means they will need to be in isolation for longer than you.'

As news spread about the rule this week, many Kiwis were quick to speculate over whether it could be a mistake.

However, the government says that the confusing isolation rule was not a mistake, and that household close contacts are required to isolate for 24 days.

Jacinda Ardern has introduced a new Covid-19 home isolation rule so extreme that some people thought it was a bad joke

How employers and employees will manage the lengthened isolation period is already raising concerns.

'This government does not know what they're doing,' another wrote.

'Who has that much annual leave to take, because that's what we have to do at our job, use our annual leave,' said Haze.

Employment lawyer Barbara Buckett, of BuckettLaw, told RNZ it's unclear how people who can't work from home can stretch their existing leave balances over the 24 days.

'It really is a compulsory leave situation which may or may not comply with the sick leave requirements and certainly 24 days is going to exhaust most people's sick leave,' she said.

However, others suggested the rule change was a good idea.

Dave McGrath said: 'It's super simple, the family members might catch it from them for up to 10 days, and need 14 days from then. Some people just enjoy complaining.'

Epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker told the New Zealand Herald 24-day isolation periods are not new and based on health advice that have underpinned New Zealand's Covid response.

The changes are part of the first phase of NZ's new three phase plan to try and 'stamp out' Omicron before it spreads widely.

At stage two of the plan, positive cases need to self-isolate for 10 days and contacts for seven days as the focus shifts to slowing the spread.

2022-01-26 14:15:04+00:00,4,"Dr Gregory Poland (pictured), a top epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic, warned Covid could be with humans for so long that 'your great-great-great-grandchildren will still be getting immunized' against the virus

While many Americans are beginning to look towards a life after Covid, and some experts are making optimistic predictions about the future of the pandemic, the entire scientific community is not in agreement.

Dr Gregory Poland, epidemiologist for the Mayo Clinic and is editor-in-chief of the scientific journals 'Vaccine' and one of the nation's top experts on vaccination and immunology, said this week that the virus could be affecting humans for the next century.

In a conversation with MarketWatch on Tuesday he gave a grave prediction that counters what some worldwide global health experts are saying.

Due to the rapid transmission of the Omicron Covid variant combined with its more mild nature, experts are hopeful that it be the strain that transitions the virus from a pandemic to an endemic, meaning the pattern of the virus is stable and predictable. Poland does not share the same optimistic point of view.

'We are not yet at any stage where we could predict endemicity. We're not going to eradicate it,' Poland said.

He noted that the virus has shown the ability to infect animals, meaning it can potentially circulate indefinitely as it transmits across species and continues to mutate.

Poland believes the virus will circulate for so long that people will still be receiving Covid shots for generations down the line.

Transmission of COVID-19 has been so rampant among the vaccinated, unvaccinated and even among animals that Poland, and other experts, fear it will be impossible to control and circulate for dozens of years down the line. Pictured: A woman in Thornton, Colorado, receives a shot of a COVID-19 vaccine on March 6, 2021

'So let me make a prediction, which will be hard for any of you to hold me to because we will all be dead by then, but your great-great-great-grandchildren will still be getting immunized against coronavirus,'

'How can I even say such a thing? If you got your flu vaccine this fall you were immunized against a strain of influenza that showed up in 1918 and caused a pandemic.'

This is not the first grim prediction Poland has made, and he has been correct before.

Last month, he told DailyMail.com that he believed 32,000 people would die from Covid between early December to the end of the year.

'32,000 Americans who think they're going to be alive to celebrate Christmas and New Years are, no pun intended, dead wrong,' he said on December 9.

'Not one of them believes [they will die].'

During that period, 31,000 U.S. Covid deaths were recorded, nearly a spot on prediction, per Our World in Data.

Poland is not the only expert whose forecasts for the future of the pandemic are not as rosy as the forming consensus.

Dr Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert and director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease, warned last week that a new Covid strain could form that would dramatically alter the state of the pandemic - like the Omicron variant did after Delta.

'I would hope that [Covid becoming endemic is] the case. But that would only be the case if we don't get another variant that eludes the immune response of the prior variant,' Fauci said during a Davos Agenda virtual event.

Fauci has also made contrarian statements about the future of the pandemic that proved to be true in the past, predicting in August that a vaccine-resistant Covid strain was likely on the horizon due to the rampant spread of the virus among the unvaccinated.

A few months later, South African officials would discover the Omicron variant during the week of Thanksgiving.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, also warned this week that it would be dangerous to assume that Omicron is the 'endgame' Covid variant.

The Omicron variant caused Covid cases to explode across Europe, Africa and the U.S. after its discovery in late-November.

The mutant strain did not prove to be a long lived, one, as it has already largely receded in the UK and South Africa - the countries that were hit the hardest and fastest by the variant.

Even in the U.S., places like New York and New Jersey that were struck first by the variant are now recording sharp declines in cases.

The variant is also more mild than other forms of the virus, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealing data Tuesday showing that Covid cases peaked 400 percent higher during the Omicron wave than they did during the summer Delta surge - though deaths were actually down four percent.

Meat Loaf, whose real name was Michael Aday, shared his children with his first wife Leslie whom he was married to for about two decades until 2001.

Leslie had Pearl from a previous marriage but Meat Loaf adopted her. A few years later, he and Leslie conceived Amanda.

Pearl grew to become a singer herself and also married Scott Ian, who shot to fame as the rhythm guitarist for Anthrax.

Meanwhile Amanda became an actress, appearing on such programs as Carnivale, My Name Is Earl and Rizzoli & Isles.

The singer died after a struggle with COVID-19, with TMZ sources saying his condition rapidly deteriorated to critical after he became sick with the virus.

Meat Loaf railed against endless coronavirus restrictions and against vaccine mandates but it is unclear whether he himself was vaccinated.

Two weeks before his death Pearl wrote on Instagram that some of her 'friends and family' had contracted COVID-19.

After his death: Amanda wrote on Facebook that 'Pearl and I along with his closest friends were able to be with him holding his hands and showering him with love in his final hours'

She added: 'Thank their respect for science that they’re all vaxxed, otherwise they’d be way worse,' without mentioning her father specifically.

After his death Amanda wrote on Facebook: 'Although his passing was very sudden, my sister Pearl and I along with his closest friends were able to be with him holding his hands and showering him with love in his final hours.'

She continued: 'I will have much more to say in the the coming days as I process through my grief. For now I will just say that he was simply larger than life and I will miss him every day for the rest of mine.'

Michelle Stani, 37, of Bridgewater, passed away at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick on January 12 after suffering coronavirus complications linked to pneumonia. It's unclear if she was vaccinated.

The single mom had given birth to her fourth child, Jayden, at the hospital via cesarean section on December 24, but she was never able to hold her baby boy, her aunt Tina Stani told the New York Post.

'Her partner [Frank Allen] had taken a picture of the baby and showed it to her, but that’s all she got,' she said. 'It tore her up. She literally texted me that she was heartbroken, that she wished she could hold her baby. That’s all she wanted.'

Michelle Stani, 37, of Bridgewater, New Jersey died of COVID-19 complications on January 12, three weeks after she gave birth to her fourth child

The mother of four was unable to hold her newborn son, Jayden, before she died at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick

Michelle, whose funeral was held Wednesday in her hometown of Somerset, leaves behind four children: Samantha, 19, Noah, 4, Jordan, 11 months, and Jayden, 3 weeks.

Tina said she didn't know if her niece had been vaccinated against COVID-19.

'I don’t know, she was pregnant for almost two years,' she explained. 'I would love to say one way or the other, but I don’t know.'

Michelle's brother Jack Stani told NJ.com that he had initially assumed she was vaccinated but then wasn't sure after she got sick. He said their family won't talk about her vaccine status.

'I never knew my sister to be an anti-vaxxer,' he added. 'She never talked about it. We never talked about the vaccine. It was just something that never came up. It never dawned on me until she got really sick. Then I thought, ""Was she vaccinated?""'

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 41 percent of pregnant women are vaccinated, despite data that shows the shot can prevent severe disease during pregnancy.

Michelle worked as the director of a daycare center in central New Jersey. In September, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy mandated that childcare workers in the state had to be vaccinated by November 1 or face weekly testing.

She was struck down with COVID-19 in December and was hospitalized because she was having difficulties breathing.

'When she would try to sleep she would wake up having trouble breathing,' her brother Jack said. 'She got intubated pretty quick.'

He recalled how devastated she was that she was only able to see her immediate family through a glass barrier.

Michelle announced her fourth pregnancy on Facebook in October, saying she was having another boy

Michelle's partner Frank Allen shared that she gave birth to Jayden on Christmas Eve

Michelle was pregnant for almost two years, first with her daughter Jordan and then with her son Jayden

'She couldn’t see the baby. She was all alone,' he said. 'They only allowed my mother, my father, and Samantha to see her. And they were only able to see her through glass after she had been intubated.'

The family was asked to come into the hospital on January 10 to say their final goodbyes, according to Jack. Michelle was alone when she died two days later.

'She was the most genuine, authentic person I’ve ever met in my life,' he said of his sister. 'She never held back what she thought about anybody. She didn’t care who you were. She let you know exactly how she felt about you.'

Michelle got her master’s degree in education from Rutgers University last fall while pregnant with her daughter Jordan and working full-time.

'She wanted to own her own daycare, that was the end goal for her,' Jack said. 'She was active, she was independent and she wanted to do it all on her own. I don’t know how the hell she did it.'

Michelle was 17 when she welcomed her first child, Samantha. For years, it was just the two of them, but then she met her partner Frank and had three more children.

Samantha, who spoke at her mother's funeral, posted a heart-wrenching tribute on Facebook last week.

'My angel. My rock, my soulmate. I am eternally grateful for the life you gave me, the time I shared with you, for the mother that you were to me. No one will ever understand our bond and connection,' she wrote.

'I need to see you again and I know one day I will and I promise I will give you the longest hug ever. You have impacted so many people, you are an inspiration. Noah, Jordan, Jayden, and I will always live through you and make you proud. I will cherish our amazing memories forever and I will continue to miss you every single day,' she continued.

'I keep thinking this is a dream I never thought I would lose you. My heart is so broken and life will never be the same without you but I will always carry you in my heart. I learned so much from you and I am so proud of all your accomplishments. There is truly no one like you, you are the best. I love you so much my mommy please watch over me.'

Michelle is survived by her parents John and Susan Stani, her partner Frank, her brothers Sean and Jack, and her four children, according to her obituary

Michelle is survived by her parents John and Susan Stani, her partner Frank, her brothers Sean and Jack, and her four children, according to her obituary.

She was described as being a music lover and a Dave Matthews Band fan who 'attended many of their concerts throughout her life.'

'She was a fun person, who loved to dance and if you brought her any place with music, she would be on the dance floor the whole evening getting others to join in,' the obituary said.

A GoFundMe account started by Michelle's family has raised more than $38,000 to cover the cost of childcare and education for her four kids.

2022-01-20 19:40:07+00:00,1,"Republican Rep. Thomas Massie revealed Thursday that he's tested positive again for COVID-19.

'I will not be voting, meeting in person, or making public appearances until next week. I am not vaccinated or boosted,' the 51-year-old congressman disclosed. 'If trolls or media have other questions about my health status, the answer is most likely, ""NUNYA.""'

Massie originally contracted COVID-19 early in the pandemic and received a positive test for antibodies in July 2020.

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie revealed Thursday that he's tested positive again for COVID-19

Massie said he suspected he had mild symptoms because he tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in 2020, meaning he had a previous infection. He also suggested he might have caught the Omicron variant

Massie, who's been against vaccine mandates, also disclosed that he remains unvaccinated

The Kentucky Republican also said the only medication he's taken is a generic form of Claritin, which treats allergy symptoms

'I can't guarantee, but I suspect my symptoms have been very mild due to prior infection 2 years ago,' he tweeted Thursday. 'Also, perhaps this was omicron?'

Massie said the only medication he's taken is a generic form a Claritin, an allergy drug.

'Seek doctors advice if you find yourself sick, because every case is unique and some cases are very serious,' he advised.

A wave of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have tested positive for the virus since Omicron surged in Washington, D.C.

Since the beginning of the year, 24 House members including Massie have tested positive for the virus, along with two senators, according to a tracker created by PBS Newshour's Lisa Dejardins.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, also announced Thursday he tested positive.

Two other Republicans who tested positive for in January, Reps. Nancy Mace and Ashley Hinson, had also previously had COVID.

Massie has been an outspoken critic against vaccine mandates.

In August, he faced blowback after posting and deleting a tweet that compared vaccine mandates to the holocaust.

More recently, Massie went after Washington, D.C.'s decision to require patrons to be vaccinated if they want to dine indoors.

Massie has been an outspoken critic of vaccine mandates and tore into one Washington, D.C. imposed over the weekend on diners

'The DC vaccine mandate kicks in this weekend. My office will not comply. We will not show papers,' Massie tweeted last Thursday. 'We will not order takeout from restaurants that require papers for dine in. We will get our food from Virginia or we will bring it to work.'

'Shame has befallen our nation's capital,' Massie added.

D.C.'s Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton replied saying that she would provide sandwiches to members of Massie's staff who are vaccinated and boosted but are 'afraid they'll get fired if they order in.'

'If that description fits you and you're hungry, DM me and my staff will be in touch,' Norton wrote. 'DC has your back.'

Massie replied that his office appreciated her offer.

'Just please promise you won’t drive to get the sandwiches,' he said.

He then shared a 2015 viral video of the congresswoman trying to park in a diagonal space, hitting vehicles next to her several times, before giving up.

'Would you like a sandwich too, @RepThomasMassie,' Norton wrote in response. 'You'll feel better after you eat. There's even a word for feeling grumpy when you're hungry: Hangry. There, there.

2022-01-20 01:30:13+00:00,2,"Novak Djokovic's hesitancy to get vaccinated is well known - but it can also now be revealed the tennis superstar reportedly purchased a majority stake in a Danish biotech company looking to develop a treatment against Covid-19 in June last year.

International news organisation Reuters reports the world number one holds an 80 per cent stake in QuantBioRes, who are currently developing a peptide which prevents the virus from infecting human cells.

Djokovic, 34, is said to own 40.8 per cent of the company - while his wife Jelena owns 39.2 per cent.

Serbian star Djokovic's refusal to get jabbed saw him deported from Australia on Sunday - a day out from play at Melbourne Park commencing - after the Federal Court upheld Immigration Minister Alex Hawke's decision to cancel his visa.

The minister argued Djokovic risked 'inciting anti-vaccination sentiment' if he competed in the Australian Open.

Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka (pictured) would like to see a 'no jab, no play' policy enforced on the professional circuit

Spanish star Rafael Nadal backed Azarenka's claims, declaring he will always support safer health measures

Djokovic originally flew into Australia on January 5, armed with a medical exemption to play in Melbourne - but it was rejected by border force officials at the airport and later the Immigration Minister.

It comes as two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka said she would like to see a 'no jab, no play' policy enforced on the professional circuit.

Speaking on Wednesday following her emphatic win over Switzerland's Jil Teichmann, the former world No. 1 backed talk of a vaccine mandate.

'I believe in science. I believe in getting vaccinated. That is what I did for myself. I don't want to push my beliefs onto everybody else however, we are playing a global sport that are travelling around the world,' Azarenka said.

'As an entity, as an association of WTA, that is travelling globally, we still have to respect countries, different countries, different mandates, different legalities of the country.

'I won't necessarily say that getting vaccinated, then nobody will be sick, but I think it is a step to hopefully battle against this coronavirus, hopefully bring it down globally.'

Azarenka went onto state the Djokovic situation in recent weeks in Australia has been a 'circus' and further proof visa rules should be changed.

Spanish star and men's tournament favourite Rafael Nadal backed Azarenka's comments.

'If everybody's vaccinated, we are allowed to improve our life on the tour, and most important our life outside of the tour,' the 20-time Grand Slam winner said.

Of course, I will be always supporting the safer health measures that helps to save lives in this world more than any other thing.'

2022-01-18 12:00:11+00:00,8,"One of the four inmates named in the suit, Edrick Floreal-Wooten, said he felt violated

Four inmates at an Arkansas jail are suing the facility and its doctor after they were allegedly tricked into taking ivermectin to treat COVID-19 - despite the CDC warnings that the drug does not prevent or treat the virus, and can have serious side effects.

The inmates at Washington County Jail were told the pills they were taking were just vitamins, antibiotics or steroids, according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas in federal court Thursday on behalf of the detainees.

'The truth, however, was that without knowing and voluntary consent, Plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all agree is not an effective treatment against COVID-19,' the lawsuit continued.

The suit states that inmates were given the drug as early as in November 2020 and in very high doses.

One of the four inmates named in the suit, Edrick Floreal-Wooten, said he felt violated.

'It was not consensual,' he told CBS News in a prison interview. 'They used us as an experiment — like we're livestock,' he said. 'Just because we wear stripes and we make a few mistakes in life, doesn't make us less of a human. We got families, we got loved ones out there that love us.'

Floreal-Wooten, along with Jeremiah Little, Julio Gonzales, and Dayman Blackburn are now suing to demand they receive a medical evaluation by an independent provider and be 'awarded their costs, fees, and any other appropriate relief to which they are entitled.'

The suit names the jail, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder and Dr Robert Karas as defendants.

The state Medical Board has been investigating complaints against Karas over the jail's use of ivermectin, and is expected to discuss the investigation at its February meeting.

Robert Karas, the facility's doctor, is also being sued by the ACLU on behalf of the patients

According to the lawsuit, the four inmates tested positive for COVID and were quarantined in August 2021 before being given the drug

Four inmates at Washington County Jail are suing the facility and its doctor after they were reportedly tricked into taking ivermectin to treat COVID-19

'No one - including incarcerated individuals - should be deceived and subject to medical experimentation. Sheriff Helder has a responsibility to provide food, shelter, and safe, appropriate care to incarcerated individuals,' said Gary Sullivan, legal director of the ACLU of Arkansas.

The situation is reminiscent of the infamous Tuskegee Study, in which almost 400 unsuspecting poor black men were withheld treatment for syphilis for more than 40 years so doctors could track the ravages of the illness on their bodies - despite Penicillin being discovered as an effective cure for the disease in the meantime.

According to the lawsuit, Floreal-Wooten, Little, Gonzales, and Blackburn tested positive for COVID and were quarantined in August 2021.

The complaint then claims that the individuals were given a cocktail of drugs, including two to ten ivermectin pills a day.

'They said they were vitamins, steroids and antibiotics,' Floreal-Wootenold, one of the inmates in the lawsuit, told CBS News in September.

'We were running fevers, throwing up, diarrhea...and so we figured that they were here to help us...We never knew that they were running experiments on us, giving us ivermectin. We never knew that.'

The lawsuit states that Floreal-Wootenold received 3.4 times the approved dosage for ivermectin - he was reportedly given 48 mg over a period of four days, while the maximum dosage over that period according to his height and weight is 14 mg.

'High doses' is no hyperbole,' the lawsuit read.

Other inmates received even higher doses, according to the complaint. Blackburn was reportedly given 6.3 times the approved dosage.

Karas seemed to stand his ground on Facebook on Saturday, arguing that the drug was to credit for the low number of deaths at Washington County Jail

High doses of the drug, the CDC states, can cause hallucinations, seizures, coma and death. Floreal-Wootenold, who remains incarcerated at the facility, told CBS hat he feels he can't trust the medical staff at the jail anymore.

The FDA has only approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms, head lice, river blindness and rosacea. According to the agency, minor side effects for the drug include skin rash, nausea and vomiting.

'...Without knowing and voluntary consent, plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all agree is not an effective treatment against COVID-19, and that if given in large doses is dangerous for humans,' the lawsuit said.

Karas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the sheriff's office declined to comment.

Karas has previously said no inmates were forced to take the drug.

The lawsuit states that some incarcerated individuals were given Ivermectin as early as November 2020 and only became aware of the treatment in July 2021.

In a September letter sent by his attorney, Karas told a Medical Board investigator that 254 inmates at the jail had been treated with ivermectin.

In the letter, Karas said the information given to inmates about ivermectin depended on who was administering it and that paramedics had not been given 'required counseling details' to discuss with inmates about the drug.

The inmates said they were never told ivermectin was among the medications they had been given to treat their COVID-19, and instead were told they were being given vitamins

Karas said the process had since been improved.

'Since the inception of the media coverage, we adopted a more robust informed consent form to assuage any concern that any detainees were being misled or coerced into taking the medications, even though they weren't,' the letter said.

The American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists last year called to an immediate end to prescribing and using the drug to treat the coronavirus.

Pharmacy prescriptions for ivermectin boomed last summer, and health officials in Arkansas and other states issued warnings after seeing a spike in poison control center calls about people taking the animal form of the drug to treat COVID-19.

The CDC also sent an alert to doctors about the drug.

Despite the warnings, the drug had been touted by Republican lawmakers in Arkansas and other states as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

Meanwhile, Karas seemed to stand his ground on Facebook on Saturday, arguing that the drug was to credit for the low number of deaths at Washington County Jail.

'Guess we made the news again this week,' she wrote. 'Still with the best record in the world at the jail with the same protocols. Inmates aren't dumb and I suspect in the future other inmates around the country will be suing their facilities requesting the same treatment we're using at WCDC - including the Ivermectin.'",MailOnline,"['medical', 'treat', 'ivermectin', 'given', 'lawsuit', 'sue', 'inmates', 'giving', 'prison', 'jail', 'drug', 'arkansas', 'treatment', 'covid19', 'staff', 'told']",0
2022-01-15 01:10:03+00:00,14,"Bayern Munich left back Alphonso Davies has been sidelined with signs of heart inflammation, known as myocarditis, after being infected with COVID-19.

As coach Julian Nagelsmann said Friday, the Canada international will be out of action for at least 'the coming weeks' after the inflammation was detected in a follow-up examination after his return to training this week. The coach described the inflammation as 'mild' and 'not so dramatic,' citing the results of an ultrasound examination.

'Despite that, it needs to heal and that will definitely take a certain amount of time,' Nagelsmann said.

Myocarditis is a mild, temporary condition in the vast majority of cases, according to experts.

Bayern Munich left back Alphonso Davies has been sidelined with signs of heart inflammation, known as myocarditis, after being infected with COVID-19

WHAT IS MYOCARDITIS? Myocarditis is an uncommon disorder. Most of the time, it is caused by an infection that reaches the heart Myocarditis is heart inflammation caused by a viral infection, such as COVID-19. In severe cases, the inflammation can weaken the heart, cause an abnormal heartbeat, or even lead to death. Symptoms typically include chest pain or shortness of breath. Patients can treat the condition with medication aimed at regulating heartbeat and improving heart function. Some rare cases have required patients to have a device implanted in their heart to regulate heartbeat. Myocarditis is a mild, temporary condition in the vast majority of cases, experts say. Heart inflammation is uncommon in pro athletes who've had a mild COVID-19 infection and most don't need to be sidelined, according to a 2021 study conducted by major professional sports leagues. This illustration shows normal heart muscle compared to inflamed heart muscle due Advertisement

Bayern said last week that Davies had tested positive and he was back in training on Wednesday. Nagelsmann said Davies would now stop training until further notice to give his body time to recover.

That could keep Davies out of Canada's next three World Cup qualifying games in late January and early February, including a game against the United States on January 30. Canada leads qualifying in the CONCACAF region as it tries to reach its first World Cup since 1986.

Davies received his COVID-19 booster shot in December and feels fine, according to several reports.

Bayern leads the Bundesliga and plays Cologne on Saturday.

Heart inflammation is uncommon in pro athletes who've had mostly mild COVID-19 and most don't need to be sidelined, according to a 2021 study conducted by major professional sports leagues.

The results in March were not definitive, outside experts say, and more independent research is needed. But the study published in JAMA Cardiology is the largest to examine the potential problem. The coronavirus can cause inflammation in many organs, including the heart.

Canada's Alphonso Davies is considered among the world's best young defenders

The research involved professional athletes who play football, hockey, soccer, baseball and men's and women's basketball. All tested positive for COVID-19 before October and were given guideline-recommended heart tests, nearly 800 total.

None had severe COVID-19 and 40 percent had few or no symptoms - what might be expected from a group of healthy elite athletes with an average age of 25. Severe COVID-19 is more common in older people and those with chronic health conditions.

Almost 4 percent had abnormal results on heart tests done after they recovered but subsequent MRI exams found heart inflammation in less than 1 percent of the athletes. These five athletes all had COVID-19 symptoms. Whether their heart problems were caused by the virus is unknown although the researchers think that is likely.

They were sidelined for about three months and returned to play without any problems, said Dr. Mathew Martinez of Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. He's the study's lead author and team cardiologist for football's New York Jets.

Then-Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez (right) jokes with teammates on February 26 at the team's spring training facility in Florida after missing the 2020 season due to COVID-19

Some athletes have suffered considerably with coronavirus.

Buffalo Bills tight end Tommy Sweeney, Jaguars running back Ryquell Armstead, and Boston Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez missed all or some their 2020 seasons after contracting coronavirus.

Sweeney, who returned to action in 2021, suffered from an enlarged heart, according to the Bills, while Armstead was hospitalized twice as he battled complications from coronavirus.

Dr. Mathew Martinez of Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey is the study's lead author and team cardiologist for the Jets

Meanwhile, Orlando Magic center Mo Bamba missed several months of the 2020-21 season following his bout with COVID-19.

Two previous smaller studies in college athletes recovering from the virus suggested heart inflammation might be more common. The question is of key interest to athletes, who put extra stress on their hearts during play, and undetected heart inflammation has been linked with sudden death.

Whether mild COVID-19 can cause heart damage 'is the million-dollar question,' said Dr. Richard Kovacs, co-founder of the American College of Cardiology's Sports & Exercise Council. And whether severe COVID-19 symptoms increase the chances of having fleeting or long-lasting heart damage 'is part of the puzzle,' he said.

Kovacs said the study has several weaknesses. Testing was done at centers affiliated or selected by each team, and results were interpreted by team-affiliated cardiologists, increasing the chances of bias. More rigorous research would have had standardized testing done at a central location and more objective specialists interpret the results, he said.

The Jaguars' Ryquell Armstead was hospitalized twice while battling COVID-19 complications

Also, many of the athletes had no previous imaging exams to compare the results with, so there is no way to know for certain if abnormalities found during the study were related to the virus.

2022-01-13 07:30:02+00:00,2,"More active-duty law enforcement died from COVID-19 last year - for the second year in a row - than any other cause of death, with 2021 being the deadliest year in nearly a century.

There were 458 members of state, local, federal and tribal law enforcement who died in the line of duty in 2021 - a 55 percent spike compared to 295 deaths in 2020, according to a preliminary report by the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum (NLEOMF).

Of those 458, 301 lost their lives due to coronavirus, making it the leading cause of death last year, while at least 182 officers died of the virus in 2020 - an increase of 65 percent in one year.

'This year's statistics demonstrate that America's front-line law enforcement officers continue to battle the deadly effects of the COVID-19 pandemic nationwide,' the report reads.

'Preliminary data shows that some 301 officer fatalities have been identified as caused by COVID this year, and this number appears to increase almost daily.'

Meanwhile, firearms were the second-largest cause of death in 2021, with 61 officers killed by firearms, making for a 36 percent increase from 2020.

And 19 of those officers who died due to firearms-relate deaths were killed in 'ambush attacks,' which also saw a significant increase, according to the report.

Traffic-related deaths saw a massive spike last year as well, with 58 officers killed in 2021 from vehicle and motorcycle collisions, making for a 38 percent increase when compared to 2020.

Last year also proved to have the highest total number of active-duty officers who died since 1930.

The report included a map of the United States, showing the 32 states where officers lost their lives from coronavirus, with the highest concentration centered in California, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.

'It has been reported to NLEOMF that these officers have died due to direct exposure to the virus during the commission of their official duties,' the report says.

The organization noted that these figures are preliminary and a the death count is expected to rise even more before official numbers are released, as NLEOMF determines whether other officers who contracted the virus did so while on the job.

NLEOMF added that its COVID-19 Task Force is currently working on establishing if other officers who died from coronavirus did so after exposure while on-duty.

More active-duty law enforcement died from COVID in 2021 than any other cause of death

'Law enforcement officers nationwide continue to be exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the course of their daily assignments; therefore, the number of line-of-duty deaths is sadly ever-increasing,' the organization said.

Meanwhile, police departments and unions across the country, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Phoenix, have continued to protest vaccine mandates for public employees, with many threatening resignation.

Some officers have even gone so far as to file lawsuits against their respective cities or states.

In Georgia, where most departments do not mandate the force be vaccinated, a total of at least 33 members of law enforcement died from the virus as of November.

Some police departments in states without vaccine mandates, such as Florida and Tennessee, have attempted to recruit officers with the incentive of not needing COVID vaccinations to work.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced that the state would promise not to 'get between you and your doctor' while advertising recruitment for the state's Highway Patrol.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has looked into signing legislation that would offer a $500 signing bonus to any unvaccinated cops who are willing to relocate to the Sunshine State for work.

In November, the Daily Mail reported that 12 NYPD officers had relocated to Lakeland, Florida - where there is no vaccine mandate and where cops said they felt more appreciated, leaving behind New York City where a late October deadline for vaccine mandates forced those who missed it to be placed on unpaid leave.

The amount of the U.S. population vaccinated so far currently stands at 74.5 percent of the country, who have received at least one dose as of January.

2022-01-12 02:53:45+00:00,11,"Novak Djokovic has admitted attending an event with children while he was Covid positive, but said he didn't know he was infected until shortly afterwards as he addressed questions about his positive Covid test in mid-December.

His public statement comes amid claims in German media of possible inconsistencies in the tennis star's test results from Serbia which could create new visa problems for the world no. 1.

Djokovic has been the subject of intense scrutiny for presenting awards to children at a tennis event in the Serbian capital Belgrade on December 17 - a day after testing positive to the virus, and for making a false declaration before landing Australia.

In an Instagram post on Wednesday, the 34-year-old lashed out at 'misinformation' and claimed it wasn't until after the event that he learned he was Covid positive.

But the Serbian did own up to then conducting an in-person interview with French newspaper L'Équipe knowing he was positive, a mistake he put down to an 'error in judgement'.

He also admitted his agent made an administrative error and accidentally ticked an incorrect box about his travel history.

Now, Australia's immigration Minister Alex Hawke says he is considering cancelling the visa another time, as the fresh doubts emerged.

In an update to Australian media, Hawke's spokesman acknowledged receiving 'lengthy further submissions' from the player's lawyers.

'Naturally, this will affect the timeframe for a decision,' he said.

In his lengthy social media post, Djokovic wrote: 'I want to address the continuing misinformation about my activities and attendance at events in December in the lead-up to my positive Covid test result.

Djokovic said he attended a basketball game on December 14 and then found out multiple people at the event had tested positive to the virus.

'This is misinformation which needs to be corrected, particularly in the interest of alleviating broader concern in the community about my presence in Australia, and to address matters which are very hurtful and concerning to my family.'

Djokovic said he attended a basketball game on December 14 and then found out multiple people at the event had tested positive to the virus.

He said he took a rapid antigen test, which came back negative, and then an official PCR test the same day 'out of an abundance of caution'.

The Serbian claimed he only found out about his positive PCR result in the hours after the Belgrade tennis awards event.

'The next day, on 18 December I was at my tennis centre in Belgrade to fulfil a long-standing commitment for a L'Équipe interview and photoshoot,' he said.

'I cancelled all other events except for the L'Équipe interview.'

Djokovic admitted the decision to follow through with the interview was an 'error of judgement'.

DJOKOVIC COMES CLEAN ABOUT HIS COVID TESTS AND VISA DEBACLE I want to address the continuing misinformation about my activities and attendance at events in December in the lead-up to my positive Covid test result. This is misinformation which needs to be corrected, particularly in the interest of alleviating broader concern in the community about my presence in Australia, and to address matters which are very hurtful and concerning to my family. I want to emphasise that I have tried very hard to ensure the safety of everyone and my compliance with testing obligations. I attended a basketball game in Belgrade on 14 December after which it was reported that a number of people tested positive to Covid-19. Despite having no Covid symptoms, I took a rapid antigen test on 16 December which was negative, and out of an abundance of caution, also took an official and approved PCR test on that same day. The next day I attended a tennis event in Belgrade to present awards to children and took a rapid antigen test before going to the event, and it was negative. I was asymptomatic and felt good, and I had not received the notification of a positive PCR test until after that event. The next day, on 18 December I was at my tennis centre in Belgrade to fulfil a long-standing commitment for a L'Équipe interview and photoshoot. I cancelled all other events except for the L'Equipe interview. I felt obliged to go ahead and conduct the L'Équipe interview as I didn't want to let the journalist down, but did ensure I socially distanced and wore a mask except when my photograph was taken. Djokovic is pictured during a training session at Melbourne Park on Wednesday. When I went home after the interview to isolate for the required period, on reflection, this was an error of judgment and I accept that I should have rescheduled this commitment. On the issue of my travel declaration, this was submitted by my support team on my behalf - as I told immigration officials on my arrival - and my agent sincerely apologises for the administrative mistake in ticking the incorrect box about my previous travel before coming to Australia. This was a human error and certainly not deliberate. We are living in challenging times in a global pandemic and sometimes these mistakes can occur. Today, my team has provided additional information to the Australian government to clarify this matter. While I felt it was important to address and clarify misinformation I will not be making any further comment out of utmost respect for the Australian government and their authorities and the current process. It was always an honour and a privilege to play in the Australian Open. The Australian Open is much-loved by players, fans and the community, not just in Victoria and in Australia but around the globe, and I just want to have the opportunity to compete against the best players in the world and perform before one of the best crowds in the world.

In answer to the question: 'Have you travelled, or will you travel, in the 14 days prior to your flight to Australia?' whoever filled out Djokovic's travel declaration form selected 'no'. That means the 34-year-old tennis player would have needed to remain in the same country since December 21. But social media images appeared to show that he was in Belgrade, Serbia, on December 25 and then in Marbella, Spain, from December 31 until catching his flight to Australia, via Dubai, and landing in Melbourne on January 5

'I felt obliged to go ahead and conduct the L'Équipe interview as I didn't want to let the journalist down, but did ensure I socially distanced and wore a mask except when my photograph was taken,' he said.

'When I went home after the interview to isolate for the required period, on reflection, this was an error of judgment and I accept that I should have rescheduled this commitment.'

Djokovic also blamed an administrative error on his Australian travel declaration for misleading officials about his travel in the weeks before he arrived in Melbourne.

The tennis star flew to Spain and then onto Australia before being detained by border officials last Thursday, but checked 'no' to a travel declaration form question about travel in the 14 days before landing in Melbourne.

'This was submitted by my support team on my behalf - as I told immigration officials on my arrival,' he said.

'My agent sincerely apologises for the administrative mistake in ticking the incorrect box about my previous travel before coming to Australia.'

Djokovic said the mistake was a 'human error' and in a pandemic 'sometimes these mistakes can occur'.

'Today, my team has provided additional information to the Australian government to clarify this matter,' he said.

In the final page of his Instagram post, Djokovic said he would be making no further comment 'out of utmost respect for the Australian government'.

The unvaccinated star's account of how he found out he had the virus comes amid a bombshell German news report about the Serbian's test records.

Der Spiegel highlighted a series of possible inconsistences in official records about the Serbian world number one's PCR test results from last month.

Djokovic was told he could fly into Melbourne on the basis he tested positive to the virus in Serbia on December 16 and then negative six days later.

But Der Spiegel claims when its reporter entered the code for his December 16 test into the official Serbian health database at 1.19pm on Monday, the result came back negative.

An hour later at 2.33pm, the scan returned a positive result - in what could simply be a quirk of the system.

A negative result would have invalidated Djokovic's claim to enter Australia on a temporary working visa for the tournament.

His positive test result has also been called into question by a discrepancy in the identification numbers used for every test.

The German investigation found Djokovic's December 16 test result had the ID number 7371999, but his negative result on December 22 was 7320919 - 50,000 spaces lower.

Researchers claimed the mismatched identification numbers showed Djokovic may actually have tested negative on December 16 and then positive six days later.

Such a result would have also made the Serbian ineligible to enter Australia on the grounds he had recently contracted and recovered from the virus on December 22, as claimed on official documentation.

Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting Djokovic or his team were involved in any wrongdoing, simply that there are questions surrounding the administrative error.

The Serbian admitted he then conducted an in-person media interview with French newspaper L'Équipe knowing he was positive, a mistake he put down to an 'error in judgement'

It comes as Djokovic's entry into Australia as an unvaccinated player was questioned by World No. 38 Marton Fucsovics, who accused the Serbian of skirting the rules to play in the Grand Slam.

Fucsovics this week fired a shot at Djokovic over his decision not to get vaccinated, declaring the 34-year-old was 'finding a way around rules'.

'People's health is paramount, and there are rules that were outlined months ago, namely that everyone should vaccinate themselves - and Djokovic didn't,' Fucsovics said.

'From this point of view, I don’t think he would have the right to be here.'

British tennis legend Andy Murray on Tuesday said there are still 'a few questions to be answered' by Djokovic over his visa debacle.

'There are still a few questions that need to be answered around the isolation and stuff, which I'm sure we'll hear from him in the next few days, but I’m obviously here to try and play and win tournaments,' he said.

'He won in court, which is good. Looks like he’s going to be able to play and compete in the Australian Open, which we do want the best players there, but like I said, I think there is still a few questions to be answered.'

Djokovic's mother has also opened up about the Australian Open visa exemption debacle - and claimed he 'didn't know' he was infected with Covid-19 while pictured attending public events in Serbia last month.

Dijana Djokovic claims her son 'didn't know' he had Covid while attending events in the following days, despite court documents confirming the positive PCR test.

Photos show the tennis star hugging children at an event on December 17 before attending the Serbian National Postal Service launch of his own stamp.

'He didn't know, probably, he didn't know because when he realised he was positive then he go to isolation,' she told Sunrise on Wednesday from Belgrade.

'I really cannot say but it's maybe the best is to ask him.'

Ms Djokovic opened up on the heavy toll her son's visa saga has had on the rest of family back home, describing the last week as the 'most difficult time for us'.

'We never have, even in my worst dreams thought that something like this was going to happen,' she said.

'So honestly, for a few days, we weren't even sleeping so we are really tired and trying to do our best to spread the word about what is going on.'

Despite his successful court appeal to stay, Djokovic may still be booted from the country with Immigration Minister Alex Hawke yet to decide whether to use his personal powers to cancel his visa for a second time.

Australian Border Force has also launched a fresh investigation into whether the Djokovic lied on a travel declaration form before entering the country.

His mother is still 'very worried' he may still be deported by authorities ahead of next week's Australian Open as she issued an impassioned plea to let her son stay.

'I was reading in the newspapers there's still the possibility they may deport him so I'm very worried and I realise that this is not over yet and we are all praying that he will stay,' she said.

'I hope everyone is thinking the same.

'Don't throw him out, he is a tennis player, he is not politician, he is not a criminal, he is not a murderer, he's just a tennis player, the best in the world, just let him play and show what he knows.'

'He came to Australia to play and to win the Australian Open, this is his goal.'

Dijana Djokovic (pictured) opened up about her son's ongoing visa saga to Channel Seven's Sunrise on Wednesday morning

She doesn't think it's fair Mr Hawke may still deport Djokovic.

'The Honourable Judge Kelly made the decision he was free so I cannot understand why one man can make the other decision...... but I don't know your laws in your country so I really don't understand,' she added.

Ms Djokovic also defended her son's strong stance on vaccination and respects his decision to not get the jab.

'As mother I can't pressure him,' she said.

'I don't know what the problem is if he doesn't want to get vaccinated - that is his choice,' she said.

'Each person on this world has the opportunity to make this choice, this is like human rights.'

Ms Djokovic then slammed the rules banning players from taking part in the Australian Open unless they are fully vaccinated or have a medical exemption.

'I don't understand this law that only if you're vaccinated you can play,' she said.

Dijana Djokovic claims her son 'didn't know' he had Covid while attending events (pictured at the Serbian National Postal Service launch) in the following days of a positive PCR test on December 16

'It's not that I'm against vaccination, of course I'm not, but if you're vaccinated, it's not that you're protected from the coronavirus.

'Lot of people who have two or three vaccines get ill.

'Are they afraid he's going to cough on the court? It's silly.'

She added her son is as hungry as ever to win his tenth Australian Open title and become the first men's tennis player in history to win 21 grand slam titles.

'Now he has more strength and power to win this, because he wants to show everybody in the world why he is the best in the world,' Mrs Djokovic said.

2022-01-08 23:39:30+00:00,20,"Furniture giant Ikea has slashed sick pay entitlement for some unvaccinated staff forced to self-isolate after close contact with someone infected with Covid, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The move means unvaccinated workers, who are required by the Government to isolate for 10 days after close contact, could receive as little as £96.35 a week under Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) obligations, a legal minimum.

That compares with the average pay for Ikea shopfloor staff of £10.10 an hour outside London and £11.30 in the capital – the equivalent of £404 and £452 for an average working week.

Ikea slashed sick pay entitlement for some unvaccinated staff forced to self-isolate after Covid close contact

In an effort to tackle the impact of the ‘pingdemic’ hitting businesses, from last August people in England who were double jabbed were no longer legally required to self-isolate if they were identified as a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case – but unvaccinated workers contacted by NHS Test and Trace are required to isolate.

Ikea, which has 21 large stores and more than 10,000 staff in the UK, said ‘mitigating circumstances’ would be taken into consideration.

‘We appreciate that this is an emotive topic and all circumstances will be considered on a case by case basis, therefore anyone in doubt or concerned about their situation is encouraged to speak to their manager,’ said a spokeswoman.

Ikea later clarified that the policy only affects unvaccinated workers with ‘high levels of absence’.

The retailer is among a string of companies such as Santander and Asda which encouraged employees to receive a coronavirus jab, offering paid time off for vaccinations.

From tomorrow, staff at utilities firm Wessex Water who have not received at least one Covid vaccination or have no appointment to be vaccinated will only receive SSP if they are required to self-isolate as a close contact of a Covid case.

Average pay for Ikea shopfloor staff £404 for an average working week outside London and £452 for one in the capital

Absences had doubled in the past week, it said.

‘We need everyone to be available so we can continue to provide uninterrupted essential water and sewerage services.’

The legal position of employers treating vaccinated and unvaccinated staff differently is untested.

Richard Fox, of law firm Kingsley Napley, said: ‘With the Government telling everybody to get the vaccine and care workers forced to get it, it could be difficult for an employee to mount a claim.’",MailOnline,"['pay', 'slashes', 'forced', 'workers', 'sick', 'contact', 'required', 'close', 'week', 'covid', 'staff', 'selfisolate', 'unvaccinated', 'ikea']",0

'I wasn't particularly worried at the time. I was just too focused on being in isolation and getting better,' she added.

After seven days of illness Ms Barnett's breathing became increasingly laboured and she was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on August 12, 2021.

She added: 'I spoke to my mother who works at the hospital as a bank nurse. She knew that my breathing was very heavy and told me to go straight to hospital.

'My partner wheeled me into the hospital and I was taken straight into a room by resus. They did all my observations and stats and put me straight on oxygen.

'I then remember being taken to ward three where I spent the night. I had a funny turn there where I couldn't get up or walk. I was then admitted to ICU on Friday, August 13 - what a great day to be admitted.'

Ms Barnett said she was given 'every machine going' to try and improve her oxygen levels, but they didn't work. Eventually she turned a corner after a 12-day spell in intensive care and was put back on ward three

Soon after leaving hospital Ms Barnett noticed her hair was falling out. 'I had really long, thick hair. I didn't start losing it until I came out of hospital,' she said. 'It was hard at first but it got to the point where I woke up one morning and decide to shave it off. I took it in my stride really'

Ms Barnett was then put in an induced coma because doctors worried her high heart rate could result in cardiac arrest. She also battled Covid-induced pneumonia.

The cafe worker said the medication she was given when doctors tried to bring her round from her coma caused her to hallucinate.

'They tried getting me out of the coma after two or three days, but as I was so agitated they put me back under. I didn't know what was reality and what wasn't,' she said.

The Tonight Show host, 47, took to Instagram Monday to detail his health battle, along with a photo of himself seated in a testing room.

'Hey guys, on the first day of our holiday break I tested positive for Covid,' Fallon said. 'I was vaccinated and boostered which made me lucky enough to only have mild symptoms.

'Thank you to the doctors and nurses who work so hard around the clock to get everyone vaxxed. Thank you to NBC for taking the testing protocols so seriously and doing a great job.'

Quoting the late Gary Coleman from Diff'rent Strokes, Fallon concluded in saying, 'And also thanks for putting me in the “What ‘chu talkin’ about Willis?” isolation room when they told me the news.'

Fallon told a fan who asked about his health in the comment section that he has recovered and is slated to host the show this week. He wrote, 'The positive came back on 12/18. Back at work today and feeling 100%!'

Fallon last taped an episode of The Tonight Show on December 17, which featured guests including Anthony Anderson and Adam Devine, and Carly Pearce performing.

He also said he was 'back to 100%' in responding to Reese Witherspoon's message wishing him 'a speedy recovery.'

Fallon's case comes as a number of celebrities - such as Hugh Jackman, Whoopi Goldberg, LL Cool J and Debra Messing - have revealed they had tested positive for COVID-19 amid a spike in numbers from the omicron variant.

The omicron rates in New York City impacted NBC productions, as an outbreak among Saturday Night Live personnel led the show to tape its final episode of 2021 with no audience and a scaled down cast and crew.

The rising rates also impacted a number of Broadway productions - such as Hamilton, Ain’t Too Proud, Tina – The Tina Turner Musical and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - which were shuttered temporarily amid the outbreak.",MailOnline,"['tonight', 'tested', 'number', 'breakthrough', 'holiday', 'case', 'recovered', 'fallon', 'positive', 'work', 'covid19', 'host', 'jimmy', 'holidays', 'told']",0

'I'm so sorry to bring this news, but I'm also excited to celebrate where he is right now. My brother, Jay, went to be with Jesus just a couple hours ago,' the 45-year-old Christian crooner revealed on the band's Instagram account.

'You guys have seen him walk the uphill battle and you guys have helped carry him through so much. And man, I'm telling you, the Lord used him in such a mighty way out on the road for so many years.

2022-01-04 03:17:37+00:00,13,"More people in New York State are in hospital with COVID-19 than last winter's January surge, with over 9,500 now receiving medical treatment.

The latest numbers show more than 9,000 New Yorkers are currently in hospital with the coronavirus at level that surpass those of January 2021's peak.

Such is Omicron's infectiousness, the levels are also close to those that were seen during the early days of the pandemic in May 2020.

Currently, there are 9,563 people in hospital across the state which is 290 more than the previous highest peak, on January 18, 2021. On Monday, daily deaths hit 103 - the first time they've reached triple figures since vaccines became widely available last year.

The numbers are 199% higher than those of last month and five times higher since figures recorded in November.

More than 9.500 people are being treated for COVID in hospital. Hospitalizations started to rise even more steeply than cases with a rise of 130 percent between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve

There has been an an enormous surge in new cases in New York State, from less than 2,500 per day to nearly 50,000 per day on New Year's Eve

On Sunday, more than 4,500 people were hospitalized in the city, with 500 of them in intensive care units.

The number of daily new cases fell to around 51,700 although the figures over a holiday weekend are never as accurate tend to lag.

'We're not in a good place, I'm going to be really honest with you,' Governor Hochul said. 'Those numbers are going to be much higher tomorrow. They didn't go from, really, 90,000 to 51,000. That is simply a function of people not getting tested over the weekend,' New York's Governor Kathy Hochul said on Monday.

'This is not the wave we saw last year, where it kept just going up and up. It's just going straight up.'

People wait in line to get a Covid 19 test at a Pop Up site at West 72nd Street in New York City

The sheer numbers of hospitalizations are pushing healthcare staff to their limit.

At least 20 hospitals across the state have been ordered to stop elective surgeries because they lack the capacity to perform them.

From Tuesday, hospitals will record just how many people are being admitted for Covid-19 symptoms in order to assess how severe the wave might be.

'I just want to always want to be honest with New Yorkers about how bad this is,' Hochul said. 'Yes, the sheer numbers of people infected are high, but I want to see if hospitalizations are correlated to that.'

Current data details how more than 335 New Yorkers per 100,000 tested positive over the latest seven-day average.

New York City has the highest numbers in the state with 457.75 new cases per 100,000 residents, followed by Long Island (398.82) and the Mid-Hudson region (304.18).

The same three regions have the highest levels of vaccination among their populations but their density means people living there are more susceptible to viral spread from the omicron variant.

'Let's celebrate the first day of school in 2022 by ensuring we are taking the proper precautions to keep them open through the rest of the year,' the governor said.

'We know how to overcome this winter surge: Get the vaccine, get the booster, mask up, get tested and stay home if you're feeling sick. If we don't use these tools, many more in our communities will get sick.'

New York City, home of the nation´s largest school system, reopened classrooms to roughly 1 million students on Monday with a stockpile of take-home COVID-19 test kits and plans to double the number of random tests done in schools.

'We are going to keep our schools open and ensure that our children are in a safe environment,' newly sworn-in Mayor Eric Adams said.

Across the U.S., new COVID-19 cases have tripled in the past two weeks to over 400,000 a day, the highest level on record, amid a rush by many Americans to get tested.

The high infection rates and resulting worker shortages are putting a heavy burden on employers large and small. Thousands of airline flights have been canceled in recent days, and many businesses have shelved return-to-work plans.

Weekend garbage collection was delayed in New Orleans, and jury trials in several Colorado counties were suspended. Some libraries on New York´s Long Island and a ski resort in New Hampshire had to close. A restaurant owner in Atlanta has spent $700 on rapid test kits and resorted to testing workers in the parking lot to make sure he had enough help to staff a recent dinner shift.

Policymakers and health authorities have been mindful of the toll on the economy and the education system.

Public heath experts have said that eradicating the virus is unlikely and that the world will instead have to find a way to keep COVID-19 down to an acceptable level, the way it does with the flu.

Last week, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cut the recommended COVID-19 isolation period from 10 days to five, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said: 'We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science.'

Behar explained that COVID-19 protocols at The View are incredibly strict and those who've come in contact with the virus are prohibited from entering the premises.

'If you're near someone who has been exposed and is positive, you can't come here. That's the way we operate here.

She proudly announced during a March episode of The View that she'd received her 'first shot at New York's 24-hour vaccination site at the Javits Center' the night prior.

The Sister Act actress stressed to viewers that 'the most important step that everybody can do to end all that's happening is you got to get vaccinated.'

Despite being happy with her decision to get vaccinated, Whoopi admitted that news coverage of the vaccination process gave her some preliminary nerves.

Goldberg continued: 'That was important. And I said to them, 'How do we tell people that it's not this gigantic thing?' We have to get folks in here to make that decision and also, to do it for other folks.

2022-01-03 17:08:29+00:00,16,"A judge has approved Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a Covid-19 booster shot after she was found guilty of sex trafficking charges last week.

Attorney Bobbi Sternheim asked Judge Alison Nathan if it was possible for her client - who is facing 65 years behind bars - to get the vaccine as she awaits sentencing in jail.

Judge Nathan said it was 'available' at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she is being held and where Maxwell has described as a 'hell hole'.

Ghislaine Maxwell, who is facing 65 years in jail after a jury found her guilty last week, requested to get the shot after the verdict was read

Judge Nathan said the booster shot was 'available' at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she is being held, and that she would 'look into it'

The court has been advised that Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) is making booster shots available within a week of receiving a request from an inmate.

Maxwell's defense team is advised to follow the MDC's instructions for requesting a booster.

If a request is made and a booster not provided, Maxwell's lawyers may make a further application to the court.

The parties are also ordered to submit a joint letter by January 10, 2022, proposing a schedule for sentencing.

The joint letter should also propose a schedule for the perjury counts.

Maxwell is facing up to 65 years behind bars after jurors declared her a child sex predator.

The long prison sentence faced by Maxwell gives her ample motivation to 'flip' and discuss the actions of others within Epstein's circle. Epstein himself took his own life in jail in New York in August 2019 while awaiting trial.

His victims have been calling for others Epstein associated with to be held account, and have pointed out that the disgraced pedophile financier, who died aged 66, counted a plethora of famous faces among his friends.

On Wednesday, Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim asked Judge Alison Nathan if it was possible for Maxwell to get her booster shot to protect her from Covid-19

Maxwell could now be willing to implicate others, in order to reduce her sentence. Her family said they were 'very disappointed' with the verdict and had already begun the appeal process with the belief she will be 'vindicated'.

Her family lawyer, Leah Saffian, who has been a regular in the courtroom sat with her relatives, was spotted by The Miami Herald on Tuesday beckoning over James Hill, a producer for ABC News, to introduce him to Maxwell.

Maxwell smiled and appeared to introduce herself to Hill and was heard to say that she was willing to speak to the media, the newspaper reported - before a US Marshal told the journalist to return to his seat.

The 60-year-old's legal team are also already working on an appeal – but the guilty verdicts will intensify the pressure on Maxwell's friend Prince Andrew to speak to US prosecutors about his time with Epstein.

The jury took just over 40 hours to find Maxwell guilty on five of six charges. One of the charges she was guilty of related to Andrew's own accuser Virginia Roberts, now known as Virginia Giuffre, suggesting jurors may have believed she was a sex trafficking victim too. She is suing the duke for alleged rape, which he strenuously denies.

Giuffre said she had 'lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse' and commended the four women who testified against Maxwell. And Lisa Bloom, a lawyer for some of Epstein's accusers, said she expected Maxwell to spend the rest of her life behind bars, adding: 'She has been lucky to have 60 years of freedom, it is far too much.'

Among those suggesting Maxwell could now 'sing like a canary' to get a reduced sentence was Piers Morgan, who warned that many powerful figures might become anxious if she decides to expose accomplices of Epstein.

Maxwell's siblings Kevin, Christine and Isabel walked out of court in New York after the vedict and declined to speak to reporters. In a statement, Maxwell's family said she would be 'ultimately vindicated' despite the jury convicting her of five of the six charges

The prosecution brought in pictures found in Epstein's mansion in a bid to show that Maxwell and Epstein had been in a relationship

He tweeted: 'Will vile sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell now sing like a canary to avoid spending the rest of her life in prison? If she does, there could be a lot of rich, powerful & famous people sweating tonight... and not sweating.'

And Walt Disney's great niece and filmmaker Abigail Disney said in a tweet: 'Ghislaine, if you want any redemption at all, I hope you will give up some names, because those fu**ers should not be able to hide any longer.'

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greeney, a Donald Trump ally, added: 'Jeffrey Epstein's entire network should be made public and his fortune should go to his victims.' And fellow Republican Representative Lauren Boebert said the public 'deserves to know every single person involved in the Epstein sex trafficking network'.

Maxwell was convicted after six days of deliberation by a jury of six men and six women. They found her guilty on five of six counts - all except enticing an individual aged under 17 to travel with intent to engage in illegal sex acts.",MailOnline,"['epsteins', 'approves', 'judge', 'maxwells', 'epstein', 'sex', 'maxwell', 'ghislaine', 'jury', 'shot', 'nathan', 'guilty', 'booster']",0

Klopp has mild symptoms and will isolate ahead of the fixture. Assistant manager Pep Lijnders will be in charge of Liverpool for the crucial match against their title rivals at Stamford Bridge.

Liverpool said in a statement that testing of the entire first-team set-up has revealed no further positive cases within the playing squad in addition to the three confirmed by Klopp on Friday.

Three backroom staff members have returned suspected positive results, however.

Should the positive test be confirmed, Klopp will also miss the midweek League Cup semi-final away to Arsenal.

Speaking on Friday, Klopp said: 'We have three new Covid cases in the team, more in the staff.

'I'm not able to say (who has tested positive) because we still need to do a PCR but you'll see tomorrow on the team sheet, it'll be clear.'

Asked if Liverpool were close to asking the Premier League to postpone the fixture, Klopp said: 'Not yet. We never had this sort of proper outbreak yet, it's more every day there's another one.

Liverpool face Chelsea in a big clash at Stamford Bridge looking to keep their title hopes alive

'It feels like a lottery in the morning when you are waiting for results.

'It was now pretty much day by day there would be one case, today another one and now we have to wait. The boys aren't even in yet.

'At the moment, (it's) probably not (likely we will ask for the game to be postponed) but we are not sure how it'll look like in a few hours.'

Liverpool are currently third in the Premier League table and are looking to hit back after losing against Leicester on December 28.

Klopp, pictured here wearing a mask last month, has seen one of Liverpool's matches postponed due to the surge in positive Covid cases, which has hit Premier League fixtures

Following Manchester City's victory at Arsenal on Saturday, Chelsea are 11 points behind the league leaders having played a game less, while Liverpool are 12 points adrift with two games in hand. Neither team, therefore, can afford to lose Sunday's blockbuster clash if they are realistically to challenge City for the title.

The surge in Covid cases caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has caused chaos within football, leaving some squads threadbare and an ever growing number of fixtures to be postponed due to lack of players.

There have been 18 postponed games in the Premier League so far due to Covid, with the New Year's Day clash between Leicester and Norwich falling the latest victim along with Newcastle's trip to Southampton on Sunday.
