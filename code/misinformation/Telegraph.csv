2021-02-27 19:37:14+00:00,16,"The UK has been leading the way in sequencing, analysing more samples than any other country - around 15 per cent of positive Covid-19 tests. But this still means many cases of new variants could be slipping through the net.

The PCR-style test would significantly increase the Government's ability to get quick snapshots of what variants are present in different parts of the country, then contain them.

It can test for the UK, South African and Brazilian variants and could be easily expanded to others if desired.

""It would be unfortunate if such variants spread in the population as they might undermine the control of the epidemic,"" said Prof Astrid Iversen, professor of virology and immunology at the University of Oxford.

""Whether you use it as part of the diagnostic test or as an additional test on all positive samples, it will be possible to run it within a typical working day.

""Consequently, you will simultaneously be able to inform people about a positive result and about whether they carry a problematic coronavirus variant or not. Moreover, it will be possible to share this information with track and trace, which subsequently can focus better on these individuals and their contacts.

""This comprehensive and quick response would help contain - and possibly eliminate - the spread of problematic variants in many cases that would otherwise be missed.""

Stephanie Oerum, research scientist at Novozymes, said the test can be run on up to 120 samples in just two hours.

""This test is the same as the PCR but with a small tweak and you're able to very quickly adjust it to new mutations,"" she said.

""It takes two hours to run the test and a day to run the sample in a facility and send it to the end user.""

The team is confirming the accuracy of the test by seeing if it can correctly detect the variant present in samples which have already been sequenced. They will publish the full results when this process is complete.",Telegraph,"['detect', '24', 'uk', 'rapid', 'variant', 'quick', 'test', 'variants', 'problematic', 'positive', 'covid19', 'samples', 'hours', 'spread', 'run']",0

2021-02-25 16:58:42+00:00,5,"It’s hard to fathom that, just over a year ago, we would stand elbow-to-elbow with our fellow humans, without a second thought as to whether they might infect us with a highly contagious disease called Covid-19.

Every February, revellers would take to the streets in Venice, wearing masks for fun, rather than to prevent infection. In spring, thousands of marathon runners would trample the streets in London, while on Easter Sundays the Pope would address the masses in St Peter’s Square. Gathering was something we enjoyed doing, rather a lot.

In this series of photographs, we look at how, over 12 months, the pandemic has transformed some of the world’s busiest sights. To not only remind us of what we have lost but also of what we can look forward to once the world returns to normal, whenever that might be.

Times Square

Of the 66 million people who came to New York City in 2019, it is estimated that 50 million paid a visit to the hyperactive heart of Manhattan: Times Square. In pre-pandemic times, hundreds of thousands of pedestrians would pass through each day, but during the Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 it has been deserted.

On New Year’s Eve, only a select handful of key workers and special guests were invited to watch the ball drop – an event which usually attracts huge crowds. What does the future hold, for tourism in the Big Apple?

The city's tourism promotion agency, NYC & Company, forecasts they won't be back to 2019 numbers until 2025.

“It’s going to be a very slow build initially,” said CEO Fred Dixon. The United States is one of the worst-affected countries in the world, with 28.9 million cases and just shy of 514,000 deaths. However, it is leading the charge when it comes to vaccinations – it has issued 65 million doses, more than any other country, amounting to 16 per cent of the population.

Leadenhall

For the first time since 1988, London’s population is in decline. The Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence predicts the city’s population could drop by as much as 700,000 over the next year. The rise in home working due to Covid-19 lockdowns, dropping birth rates and an exodus of EU residents after Brexit are all contributing to the decline. Even during the months when the UK was out of lockdown, some corners of the City, like Leadenhall Market, saw declines in footfall as office workers stayed at home.

Buckingham Palace

Unsurprisingly, tourism is down in London, too. The 9.7 million tourists who came in 2020 spent approximately £5.7 billion, compared to the £24.7 billion spent by the 32.3 million who visited the year before. Visit Britain is optimistic that tourism in 2021 will be up 21% on 2020 figures.

London Marathon

The London Marathon looked slightly different in 2020. Unlike typical years, when you would see tens of thousands of runners take to the streets in all manner of comedy costumes, due to the pandemic only 92 elite athletes took part. This didn’t stop the general public from joining in; some 43,000 people participated in a ‘virtual marathon’ closer to home, raising millions for charity.

Edinburgh

The cancellation of the Edinburgh Fringe was a huge loss for the city. More than 25,000 artists, writers and performers from around the world usually take part in the event. Nicola Sturgeon described the decision as ""heartbreaking, but the right decision"". It is still yet to be seen whether the Fringe will go ahead in 2021.

Cardiff

The area around Cardiff’s Millennium Centre is usually a hub of activity, with food stands and entertainment for children in the summer. During the Covid-19 lockdowns and ‘firebreaks’, it has been something of a ghost town. To date, Wales has recorded 202,000 cases of Covid-19 and 5,250 deaths.

Eiffel Tower

For the first time since World War Two, the Eiffel Tower has been closed to guests for many months over the past year. However, Gustav Eiffel’s architectural set-piece hasn’t been forgotten about.

It was announced earlier this month that the tower will be turning gold ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a project that will reportedly cost €50 million.

Allegedly, this is the colour that Eiffel originally intended for the tower – rather than the brown hue it has sported since 1968. Paris will be the third city (the other being London) to have hosted three Olympics – in 1900, 1924 and 2024, and the Eiffel Tower will form the symbolic backdrop for a number of events, including the triathlon and open-water swimming events.

Louvre

Possibly the world’s most famous painting, prior to the pandemic the Mona Lisa would attract 30,000 daily visits – jostling for space with selfie sticks in hand. For months in 2020, she was not seen by a single pair of eyes. In total, visits to the Louvre were down from 9.6 million in 2019 to 2.7 million in 2020.

Barcelona

In the years leading up to the pandemic, Barcelona was under pressure for its handling of so-called “overtourism”, with short-term lettings sites like Airbnb pushing up the cost of rent in the city. In 2020, the talking point of the city was the absence, not excess, of tourists as strict travel bans came into force. Pere Mariné, a native of the city’s Poblenou neighbourhood, said in May: “We’re enjoying the clean air, the calm, the silence, the peacefulness, above all because we’re not used to it. But we also miss the life of the city, the good and the bad.”

Duomo

In February and March of 2020, Italy became the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe. After cases boomed, all non-essential production and commercial activity stopped for 10 weeks from March to May – the first country in Europe to enter a national lockdown. To date, Italy has recorded more than 2.8 million cases, although France, Spain and the UK now have higher case totals.

Venice

Carnival season usually brings colour and frivolity to the floating city, pumping some much-needed money into the local economy during the quiet winter season. In normal years, for two weeks this most magical of cities fills with a mass of masked party-goers – posing and preening, dancing and philandering, in a slightly surreal re-invention of a great tradition of the city.

Not so, in 2021. The 3 million tourists who would typically attend were absent, meaning only a handful of residents took part. On Sunday, February 14, the last one of Carnival season, St Mark's Square was occupied by a smattering of locals, many of whom would usually flee the city during these hectic weeks.

“It’s so odd to only hear Italian being spoken here,” said a masked Venetian woman dressed as a courtesan. “I don’t know if I like it this way. It just doesn’t seem like Carnival.” The last time the carnival was cancelled was in 1991, due to the Gulf War.

Researchers at the university’s Blavatnik School have compiled a Covid-19 Government Response Tracker, which records what policies have been enforced in more than 180 countries since the pandemic began.

Each country has been given a score of one to 100 – with 100 being the most stringent – which takes into account workplace and school closures, restrictions on public gatherings, international travel controls and stay-at-home requirements, among others.

Britons have experienced the most stringent lockdown life compared to others in the West with a daily score of 86.11, compared with 83.33 in Germany, 82.41 in Italy and 63.89 in France.

The UK’s approach has been so strict that only two other countries recorded a higher score – Venezuela, (88) and Lebanon (87). Peru and Zimbabwe have the same score as Britain.

2021-02-21 21:52:19+00:00,3,"At the beginning of lockdown nearly a year ago, like many people Tina Cook started keeping a diary. The 38-year-old single mother of five had been furloughed from her job working at a branch of McDonald’s in Leicester and at first found it a blessing. She had time to properly cook for her children, aged between 18 and five, and when the weather was warm inflated a paddling pool in the backyard where they could play, safe from the world outside.

Fast forward 12 months and those diary entries now read very differently. Tina is taking medication for anxiety and while back at work she is terrified every time she has to set foot out the door. At night she cannot sleep because she is constantly listening out for her 18-year-old daughter who has developed such bad insomnia she often doesn’t go to bed until 6am. “My anxiety is about dying,” she says, bluntly. “The children are my life and if I’m gone what will happen to them?”

The Cook family live in a row of terraced houses off Belgrave Road which is known as Leicester’s ‘Golden Mile’ and famed for its Indian restaurants, shops and jewellers. It is also one of the areas that has been hardest hit by Covid-19 in a city that has been locked down longer than any other in the country.

Hindu blessing banners flutter in a biting wind from the doorways of her neighbours. “Case numbers here are quite scary,” she says. “I keep hearing more people catching it.”",Telegraph,"['working', 'diary', 'work', 'children', 'lockdown', 'cook', 'blessing', 'covid', 'wind', 'cant', 'city', 'tina', 'shake', 'world', 'lost', 'anxiety']",0
2021-02-21 13:19:11+00:00,1,"Tender documents have been circulated by Cricket Australia for a package, currently held by BT, which includes Australia's other home internationals and the Big Bash League. Like football, cricket has tried to tempt the new platforms to the market, but Amazon are unlikely to make any offer for the Ashes as it continues to focus on its increasingly popular Premier League coverage. BT recently won the UK rights to broadcast New Zealand and West Indies domestic internationals, including England women's and men's tours respectively.

With Sky's deal with the ECB in place until 2024, Julian Aquilina, of Enders Analysis, says ""there isn't really that much scope for the rights values within cricket to move that much over the next few years.""

Rugby union

Compelling evidence that the big broadcasters are regaining their stranglehold emerged in December when BT were the benefactors of an apparent about-turn by Premiership Rugby.

England's top tier was forced to return to the marginally reduced offer on the current terms from the broadcaster after interest from Amazon apparently faded, despite its agreement for the inaugural Autumn Nations Cup internationals.

Much had been made of Amazon becoming a key player in domestic and international coverage under a potential pool agreement with CVC - the private equity firm - which recently secured an additional £300million investment deal in the Six Nations.

However, BT Sport, which became the senior broadcaster of Premiership Rugby in 2013-14, held its nerve to secure a deal marginally down on the current £40 million per year agreement. The entire package for three years is said to be worth £110 million, with BT airing up to 80 live matches - including 69 Premiership Rugby fixtures and 11 Premiership Rugby Cup ties - until 2024.

Power-brokers see the Six Nations as critical for driving fresh TV revenue, and much will depend on CVC's intentions for its 15 per cent stake, with many predicting a move away from free to air television.

BBC and ITV currently hold the rights in the United Kingdom in a deal worth around £50m which ends in 2021, but the competition does not fit within the Government’s “Crown Jewel” list of sporting events.

Formula 1

Rugby is keeping a close eye on the progress at F1, still largely shaped by prior commercial influence from CVC money. Before selling off their stake at a four-fold profit, investors expanded F1 far beyond its European heartland, establishing more races while charging a premium for hosting fees.

The main driver of revenue prior to the CVC sell off was increasing broadcasting rights with the sport going from free-to-air. Now, four years into its £6billion takeover by US group Liberty Media, F1 is also under further pressure to unlock more revenue due the pandemic.",Telegraph,"['cvc', 'rugby', 'postcoronavirus', 'look', 'broadcast', 'revenue', 'rights', 'amazon', 'pandemic', 'tv', 'cricket', 'does', 'bt', 'premiership', 'f1', 'world', 'deal']",0

South Korea's Yonhap did not report when the alleged hacking took place or whether it was successful.

Last year suspected North Korean hackers tried to break into at least nine health organisations, including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax Inc, and AstraZeneca.

South Korea's intelligence agency said it had foiled North Korean attempts to hack into South Korean companies developing coronavirus vaccines.

Digital espionage against health bodies, vaccine scientists and drugmakers has intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic as state-backed hacking groups scramble to obtain the latest research and information about the outbreak.

North Korea is often accused of turning to an army of hackers to fill cash-strapped government coffers amid international sanctions that ban most international trade with the country.

Health experts have said the country's hackers may be more interested in selling the stolen vaccine data than using it to develop a homegrown vaccine.

North Korea is expected to receive nearly two million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine by the first half of this year through the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme.

North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infection, but the NIS had said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the country had active trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing the border in early 2020.

David Chadwick of Verifiable Credentials, which has received government funding to develop vaccine passports, said he had already agreed a tie-up with one UK theatre and cinema complex to trial the technology.

Under the scheme, Verifiable Credentials would create electronic certificates for people to show they have been vaccinated. These certificates would be verified by the NHS and stored in a digital wallet on users' smartphone.

When users buy a film ticket from a participating cinema, that ticket would be combined with the digital vaccine passport to generate a QR code that would provide them with access to the theatre.

Mr Chadwick said the trial was currently assessing the technical feasibility of the system rather than whether it was commercially or legally viable.

However, he said ""checking people's vaccination certificates might help cinemas to reopen in the future"".

It comes as the industry struggles to stay afloat, as blockbuster film releases have been delayed and venues have been shuttered to curb the spread of Covid-19.

New Zealand's greatest vulnerability has been at the border.

New cases are regularly caught among returning travellers, all of whom are required to spend two weeks in quarantine.

Despite precautions, there have been several times when the virus has leaked out from the border before being controlled again, and officials are trying to determine whether that's happened again.

In the latest case, an Auckland mother, father and daughter caught the disease. Officials said the mother works at a catering company that does laundry for airlines, and officials are investigating whether there is a link to infected passengers. Officials said the woman hadn't been going aboard the planes herself.

2021-02-14 00:32:34+00:00,40,"Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust who sits on Sage, the Government advisory committee, was among a number of influential scientists this week to suggest Governments' strategies should switch to more universal vaccines.

Backing an article in the influential Nature journal titled Variant-proof vaccines: invest now for the next pandemic, he tweeted: ""We agree - and being acted upon by CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) and others.""

UK company Scancell, which specialises in developing cancer vaccines, and several other firms from Europe and the US are already working on variant proof jabs and hope to prove shortly they can produce an effective immune response.

Alongside scientists from the University of Nottingham, Scancell is targeting a protein in the core of the virus called the nucleocapsid or “N” protein, as well as the spike protein. Human trials of their vaccine will begin in the second half of this year, after positive results from testing the jab on mice.

The DNA-based product seems to stimulate a good antibody and T-cell response. Scancell chief medical officer Dr Gillies O’Bryan-Tear, told The Telegraph: “We don’t necessarily claim it will be a pan-coronavirus vaccine, but it has got the potential to be so simply because of where it is targeted.”

A number of other biotechs are working on similar jabs, including myNEO in Belgium, and Osivax in France. The latter has just completed a phase II clinical trial of a universal flu vaccine that also targets the N protein.

MyNeo, meanwhile, has used modelling to suggest which parts of the virus might remain stable longest, allowing them to maximise vaccine longevity.

Cedric Bogaert, co-founder and CEO of myNEO, said: “One of the main cornerstones of the design procedure was to address resistance to future mutations, as we wanted a preventative vaccine design.”

The team estimate this jab could be ready within three years, if it shows good results in trials.

Other researchers in the US are looking at other options for broader protection.

Dr Maria Elena Bottazi, co-director of the vaccine development centre at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, was part of a team that developed a Sars vaccine candidate several years ago. They theorised it could also be used more broadly against other coronaviruses; but no-one was interested.

“At the beginning of the pandemic, we said let’s just take the Sars vaccine - it may not protect 90 per cent, but it may protect 50 per cent. We showed cross protection, and nobody cared about it,” she said.

The team is now developing an affordable coronavirus vaccine candidate with Biological E in India, but Dr Bottazi backs calls for a better focus on developing vaccines that does not just hop from crisis to crisis.

There are other options, too. For example, researchers at VBI Vaccines in the US have been testing a vaccine on mice which has combined the spike proteins of the coronaviruses causing Sars, Mers and Covid-19. The animals made antibodies to all three: and, interestingly, also to a fourth coronavirus, which causes seasonal colds, suggesting broader protection could be possible.",Telegraph,"['exclusive', 'protein', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'working', 'scancell', 'universal', 'available', 'team', 'developing', 'variants', 'virus', 'sars', 'used', 'conquer']",0
2021-02-12 23:45:24+00:00,11,"There is also hope that influenza antivirals such as favipiravir and molnupiravir could be repurposed in the fight against coronavirus, with small trials showing they improve lung function. Large trials are under way, with results expected in the spring.

One clever antiviral treatment in the pipeline is called Recombinant ACE-2. To infect the body, coronavirus uses grippy rods called spike proteins to latch on to the human ACE-2 protein on the outside of cells. In laboratory studies, scientists have shown they can deploy artificial ACE-2 proteins as decoys, thereby luring the virus away from real cells. Trials are ongoing to see if it will work in humans.

Drugs that boost the immune system also look promising. Scientists are currently testing whether the blood plasma of recovered patients could improve survival rates. Using the blood of patient survivors of an illness dates back to the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, before vaccines or antivirals were available. It relies on the fact that the blood of recovered patients contains powerful antibodies already trained to fight the virus.

Last week, a large trial by Oxford showed that blood plasma does not prevent death in seriously ill patients, but the team is still awaiting a full breakdown of results to see if it benefited certain sub-groups. International trials are also currently testing whether plasma works if used earlier.

Similar to blood plasma, synthetic antibodies are also giving hope. Scientists look for people who have mounted a strong response to coronavirus then artificially replicate their immune proteins.

Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab has been shown to reduce people's risk of being hospitalised by 72 per cent compared to a placebo. It is currently under review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Likewise, Regeneron's antibody cocktail reduced visits to hospital by 57 per cent.

Giving monoclonal antibodies as a prophylactic also appears to be beneficial, with bamlanivimab found to reduce the risk of developing coronavirus by 80 per cent for care home residents and staff.

Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: ""They are the first anti-viral drugs that demonstrably work in the first phase of the disease just after the virus has infected someone but before it has had time to cause a lot of damage.""

Another way of boosting immunity is to give patients interferons. When the body is under attack, it produces molecules called interferons which boost the immune system while also keeping it in check.

Last summer, the British pharma company Synarigen published results showing its inhaled form of interferon ""SNG001"" lowered the risk of severe Covid-19 in infected patients. Larger studies are ongoing.

For many seriously ill coronavirus patients, the immune system does not need any help, but requires dampening down. The steroid dexamethasone has been shown to cut deaths of severely ill patients by one-third and is now given to severely ill NHS patients as standard.",Telegraph,"['crisis', 'treatments', 'system', 'offering', 'drug', 'best', 'covid', 'coronavirus', 'trials', 'blood', 'shown', 'immune', 'patients', 'scientists', 'way', 'hope', 'plasma', 'ill']",0

The Prime Minister and ministers including Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, have repeatedly said that the ""roadmap"" will be published on February 22, although they have also made reference to it happening in the ""week beginning February 22"".

Any later than the Monday of that week would mean the reopening of schools is pushed back from March 8, as the Government has previously committed to giving teachers and parents two weeks' notice.

But on Thursday the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We've been clear we will publish the roadmap on the week of February 22.

Born Lucile Randon on Feb 11, 1904, Sister Andre said she didn't realise she had caught the coronavirus, which infected 81 residents of her retirement home in the south-east city of Toulon, killing 10 of them.

""I'm told that I got it,"" the nun told the AFP news agency from her home, where she sat basking in the winter sun, her eyes closed and hands clasped in prayer.

Jamie Greene, education spokesman for the Scottish Tories, said: “All too often promises on mass testing in our schools have failed to materialise under the SNP, so this is a welcome step in the right direction.

“With the UK Government supporting the testing efforts, it shows how both of Scotland’s Governments are working closely together in order to tackle Covid cases as quickly as possible in our schools.

“It is imperative SNP ministers give our schools every resource they require to guarantee this expanded testing regime will be successful as pupils return to classrooms in the coming weeks.”

Anyone testing positive will be told to isolate immediately and book a PCR test, which is seen as more accurate with results analysed in a lab.

The Scottish Government has said getting children back into classrooms is its number one priority in easing restrictions.

However, initially only pre-schoolers and those in Primary 1-3 will be allowed back, along with the senior pupils. Primary pupils will not be tested. The same testing regime will be in place in private schools. Tests are being delivered to schools from this week.

Mr Swinney said: “The purpose of the programme is to contribute to the reduction of Covid 19 related risks in schools and ELC [early learning and childcare] settings, and in so doing to enhance the confidence of our school/ELC communities.

“It will do so by helping to identify asymptomatic individuals in school and ELC environments at the earliest opportunity, and asking them and their close contacts to self-isolate, thus minimising the likelihood of them passing on the virus.”

The Scottish Government had initially pledged that a Covid-19 testing regime for schools would be in place within weeks last summer, but it never materialised.

Public health experts hope that asymptomatic testing will help them better understand the role of schools in driving outbreaks, as many young people who catch the virus do not display symptoms.

Beatrice Wishart the LibDem MSP called for registered childminders to have access to testing on the same basis as teachers and school-based nursery staff.

“Unfortunately, once again there are big holes in the proposals that the government have set out,” she said.

""Childminders have an important role to play in ensuring parents can access the childcare they need but they are being treated like second class citizens. They should have the same access to testing as early years workers in other settings.

""Ministers need to ensure that this testing is made available and in future make sure that all early years staff receive the reassurances they need to work safely.""",Telegraph,"['schools', 'scottish', 'need', 'teenagers', 'programme', 'early', 'access', 'urged', 'test', 'covid', 'plan', 'return', 'swinney', 'testing', 'pupils', 'regime']",0

The row comes just four days before the Government introduces its hotel quarantine, forcing all returning Britons to pay up to £1,750 each to self-isolate for 10 days and triple Covid tests for all arrivals, including those who will have to quarantine at home for 10 days.

Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson swerved questions on how much of the lockdown will be lifted by the summer.

""I'm afraid it is just too early for people to be certain about what we will be able to do this summer. We hope to be able to say more in the week of February 22,"" he said. ""I understand why people want to make plans now but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient.""

His evasion drew frustration from BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg who was caught on a ""hot mic"" bemoaning Mr Johnson's failure to answer to her question on the subject.

Earlier Mr Shapps, the Transport Secretary, said there was no guarantee that breaks would be possible at all this year, adding that he did not want to ""raise people's hopes"".

""I don't know what the situation will be by the middle of the summer. Nobody can tell from the point where we sit right now,"" he said. ""You shouldn't be booking holidays right now, either internationally or domestically.

""Until we know the route out of lockdown, which we can't know until we have more data, more information on vaccines as well, please don't go ahead and book holidays for something which, at this stage, is illegal to actually go and do – whether it's here or abroad.""

Asked what needed to change for restrictions on overseas travel to be lifted, Mr Shapps said: ""First of all, everybody having their vaccinations."" Questioned on whether the rules will remain in place until that happens, he said: ""Yes.""

Your questions on what the new variant could mean for vaccines were answered by our science editor, Sarah Knapton, at noon on Feb 10 during a live Q&A. You can find a recap of Wednesday's Q&A below.

If you've been vaccinated and get Covid symptoms do you still need to self-isolate?

Q: If you have had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and have Covid symptoms do you still need to isolate?""

A: You still need to self-isolate if you get Covid symptoms even after having the full two doses because not everyone will be protected from the vaccine.

Will the gap between doses undermine the vaccine's protection?

Chris has asked a question about the 12-week gap between vaccine doses.

Q: Is it a mistake to undermine the protection the Pfizer vaccine can give by extending the gap between doses to 12 weeks?

A: The government has decided that offering less protection to more people is safer than giving more protection to fewer people. Even at one dose the vaccine is likely to have a very strong effect against hospitalisation and death, even if people do still become infected.

Why won't the South African variant become dominant in the UK?

Q: Scientists say it is unlikely that the SA variant will become dominant in the UK. If so, why it has become dominant in South Africa?

A: The South African variant does not appear to have a ‘transmissibility advantage’ unlike the UK variant so is unlikely to spread as quickly. The UK mutation is about 70 per cent more infectious.

As far as I know there isn’t a variant with such a transmissibility advantage currently in South Africa which is why the South African variant remains dominant.

How are the vaccines being tested against the new variants?

Q: I'd like to know how the validity of a vaccine against new variants is being tested? Are people testing the vaccine actively put in direct contact with people bearing the virus? Or is it just left to chance?

A: There are currently no challenge trials (where someone is deliberately exposed to the virus) happening for coronavirus, although several are in the planning stage. Instead, researchers are sequencing people in vaccine trials who pick up the virus to see which variant they are infected with. That way they can work out if the new variants are having a greater impact, or evading immunity.",Telegraph,"['vaccine', 'questions', 'jabs', 'answered', 'vaccines', 'protection', 'uk', 'doses', 'variant', 'covid', 'south', 'variants', 'dominant', 'qa', 'coronavirus', 'work']",0

The taxpayer had been expected to pick up the tab for those arriving from one of the 33 red list locations to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. However Mr Hancock confirmed that arrivals would have to “book and pay for a quarantine package, costing £1,750” before they travel.

The “quarantine package” includes hotels, transport and testing and will be available via an online platform which will go live on Thursday, “when we will be publishing more detailed guidance”, he said.

“When passengers arrive, they’ll be escorted to their UK Government transport, and taken to a designated hotel, which will be closed to guests who aren’t quarantining,” he added.

Anyone who tries to conceal their arrival from a red list country face jail sentences of up to ten years, while those who try to avoid the mandatory self-isolation in a hotel will face a fine of up to £10,000.

Yesterday Downing Street was forced to admit that no hotels had yet signed contracts, with firms understood to be concerned about an open-ended approach being sought by ministers.

In December, opposition leader Anthony Albanese urged the Government to accelerate its plan to distribute the vaccine in late March.

Malcolm Turnbull, the former prime minister, echoed Mr Albanese’s call, saying there was a “powerful case” for fast-tracking the plan.

In January, Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggested countries, including the UK, had taken risks with their schedule, telling local media there was “a real desperation” among countries vaccinating their residents quickly.

While Mr Morrison suggested that a safety-first approach was the reason behind the delay, his government had not secured deals for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine until September, before signing deals for the Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines in November, months after other governments had already moved to secure their vaccine stock.

Under public and political pressure, the prime minister recently announced the rollout would begin in February rather than late March. It now seems likely to begin in the last week of February.

Adding fuel to the fire, in late January the EU placed export restrictions on vaccinations produced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which could further delay the rollout in Australia.

Social media users have complained of the slow distribution of the vaccine in Australia.

One Twitter user wrote: ""I love it how ppl are talking about vaccination certificates when the only vaccines in the (allegedly) foreseeable future are 10m doses of Pfizer that can only be administered through big city hospitals & we don’t know when that will happen either""

Australians who are vaccinated against Covid-19 will be able to carry proof of vaccination certificates on their smartphones through existing government apps, including the Express Plus Medicare app, it was announced on Sunday.

Paper certificates will also be issued, and Minister for Government Services Stuart Robert said “every Australian will have a record of their vaccination, should they need it”.

It is likely the vaccine certificates will be needed to gain entry to certain high-risk venues including but not limited to elderly care homes, where the vast majority of Australia’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred, but it is as yet unclear how the states and territories will regulate the use of the certificates.

In January the New South Wales government said it was considering making vaccination certificates necessary to enter pubs, cafes and restaurants in the state.",Telegraph,"['vaccine', 'covid', 'country', 'minister', 'prime', 'slow', 'start', 'vaccines', 'despite', 'reopen', 'suggested', 'late', 'rollout', 'reliance', 'vaccination', 'jab', 'including', 'certificates', 'complain']",0

Writing in The Telegraph, Nadhim Zahawi says the vaccines being used in Britain “work well against the Covid-19 variants currently dominant in the UK”.

It follows an announcement on Sunday of new findings that show the Oxford University-AstraZeneca jab does not protect against mild and moderate infection of the South African variant.

South Africa announced on Sunday it is putting its AstraZeneca programme on hold because of its poor efficacy against the variant which emerged in the country. Its health minister suggested it was only 22 per cent effective against the variant.

A new Oxford vaccine that can beat the South African variant is likely to be ready by autumn, its designers have said.

It comes amid concern over reluctance to get the vaccine among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Royal College of General Practitioners figures show that 14.4 per cent of white people have had the jab compared to 6.8 per cent of black people.

2021-02-07 21:13:00+00:00,1,"Away on the opposite side of the Bay, Steve Hayes – president and CEO of the Visit St Pete/Clearwater tourism area –has seen a similar dip in footfall. “At this time of year, our hotels are usually running at 80 or 90 per cent occupancy,” he says. “Right now, we’re at about 50 per cent. If we could just get that up to 70-80 per cent, that would be above par.”

He is, however, trying to err on the bright side. “We’re looking at the match as a case of ‘gosh we really need this’,” he explains. “I’m taking the standpoint that, OK, it’s not what we would have expected when we were awarded the event – but it’s what we have. If you look at the visibility we have at the moment, around the world, and around the United States – then that’s what we need right now. It’s still not what we would expect from a Super Bowl year, but it’s better than if we were just having our winter season at present.”

Some might say that the Super Bowl being booked into a Florida city during a pandemic is a fortuitous thing in itself –in that, with social-distancing rules observed, the state’s climate allows for outdoor events that would be impossible in February in colder regions.

“Yes, the weather here tends to co-operate,” Corrada laughs. “In other parts of the country, you might not be able to do all these outdoor things, and stay socially distant, and still enjoy the festivities. But the weather here usually works with us, not against us.”

However, there is more to the game being able to go ahead than blue skies and bright horizons. Florida’s approach to Covid-19 is also – for better or for worse – a factor. The state has suffered heavily at the hand of the virus. As of the start of this month, it has had 1.7 million confirmed cases, and 27,129 fatalities – the fourth highest state death toll, and a grim number which accounts for six per cent of the country’s total losses (443,355, at time of writing). But in spite of this –and perhaps as a contributor to it – it has kept its economy up and running. Although all but essential services were shut down in the immediate panic of March 2020, the state has changed tack since September – when governor Ron DeSantis, a staunch ally of former President Trump, pared back local restrictions, removing fines for mask violations, and permitting restaurants to open fully.

Everyday life has largely continued – and certainly enough that there has never been a question of the Super Bowl not going ahead as planned. “We’ve stayed open for business,” Corrada adds. “That really does help. It would probably have been difficult to have this Super Bowl as originally scheduled in California – based on the lockdown rules over there. I think this is a case of the right time and the right place – and the right team.”",Telegraph,"['rules', 'attempting', 'host', 'usually', 'right', 'weather', 'covid', 'bowl', 'state', 'states', 'cent', 'tampa', 'running', 'super']",0

On a more positive note Prof Spector, who created the Zoe Covid Symptom Study, said the infection survey indicates that coronavirus rates are ""generally much lower everywhere"" in the country, with around one in 170 people infected on average.

He suggested that reinstating the rule of six allowing people to meet outdoors should be ""definitely encouraged"" around the same time as primary schools begin to return.

But asked about whether private gardens were safer than outdoor pubs or restaurants, he said that ""actually sometimes a beer garden is more controlled than people's homes and gardens"".

England and Wales are hoping to vaccinate all over-50s by early May, it emerged today, after a chaotic Downing Street briefing. This morning the Cabinet Office sent out a press notice confirming local elections would take place on May 6 because of ""confidence"" that the 1-9 cohorts would be vaccinated by that time. A No 10 spokesman then claimed this had been released ""in error"" and had been withdrawn, only to confirm it was correct in a bizarre twist minutes later. Matt Hancock has since affirmed the plan, but stressed it was dependent on supply. Read the priority list for the rollout. It comes as the Welsh Government said children aged three to seven will return to school from February 22. Sage said the UK's R-rate has narrowed to between 0.7 and 1.0 and a new study shows the Oxford vaccine is capable of fighting the UK Covid variant.

Meanwhile, the Government has confirmed its hotel quarantine policy will launch on February 15, with participating hotels briefed for an ""initial period"" of 45 days - so at least until March 31. According to some experts these facilities could still exist in some form throughout 2022.

Beijing has instead pushed its own origin conspiracy theories, claiming the coronavirus was brought into the country from abroad, tossing out a range of unsubstantiated ideas. Last year, a Chinese official accused the US military of bringing the virus to Wuhan and infecting the local population.

More recently, the government has blamed imported food packaging as the culprit. But the WHO has said such instances of live viruses are “rare and isolated,” and that it’s unclear whether that’s enough to cause infections in humans.

Chinese authorities are halting or delaying food imports for inspection and sanitisation, citing concerns of subsequent outbreaks as officials have largely been able to contain the coronavirus with aggressive social distancing, quarantine and mass testing measures.

Authorities have carted people off to jail for refusing to wear face masks and sentenced one woman to prison for concealing coronavirus symptoms on a flight from the US to China last year.

This week, police in Jilin province began investigating a man, an asymptomatic coronavirus case, for violating disease control rules and infecting 82 people in a recent outbreak. Under Chinese law, it’s illegal to spread major contagious diseases, like Covid-19 – a crime punishable by up to 7 years, according to state media.

But the man, surnamed Lin, was discovered as an asymptomatic case on Jan 9 and thus wasn’t aware that he posed any risk to others, leading to legal controversy over whether a crime was actually committed.

2021-02-03 03:01:10+00:00,5,"Care home deaths from Covid-19 have surged to their highest proportion since the pandemic began, dampening hopes that visits could resume before residents are given their second jab.

New figures released on Tuesday showed there were 1,817 care home deaths involving Covid-19 in the week ending January 22, eclipsing the previous record seen in May.

According to the Alzheimer’s Society, this equated to 46.6 per cent of deaths recorded in care homes, up considerably on the previous high of 39.2 per cent and taking the total number of fatalities to more than 25,000.

Despite the record death toll, ministers are coming under mounting pressure to resume visits for relatives and friends after the Government hit its target of offering the first jab to every elderly care home resident in England.

As of Sunday, residents in 10,307 care homes across England had been offered their first dose of the vaccine, although Matt Hancock revealed that 110 homes were still awaiting jabs due to Covid outbreaks.

Gavin Terry, Head of Policy at the Alzheimer’s Society said: “With a total of over 25,000 Covid deaths now in care homes, staff vaccinations must be urgently prioritised along with rapid rollout of second jabs.

“But also, the Government must swiftly provide a concrete plan for safe meaningful visits to ensure people with dementia get vital contact with family carers. Twelve more weeks of waiting will be tragically far too late for some.”

While the second phase of inoculations for care home residents is not expected to be completed until April, it is hoped that a decline in infection rates, a high-level of protection from the first jab and additional mitigations could allow visitations before then.

Whitehall sources have told The Daily Telegraph that the testing regime implemented before Christmas, which allowed visits subject to a negative test and the use of personal protective equipment, could form part of a reopening plan.

The plan for close-contact visits through testing was set out in official Government guidance in December, but was later abandoned following the decision to plunge the country back into lockdown.",Telegraph,"['resume', 'residents', 'homes', 'pandemic', 'highest', 'start', 'care', 'deaths', 'surge', 'covid19', 'society', 'proportion', 'visits', 'testing', 'second', 'total']",0
2021-02-02 20:07:28+00:00,12,"Thanks to its young and mainly rural population, Africa has avoided the catastrophic coronavirus death tolls seen in the West.

But as the virus silently creeps across the continent, ageing government ministers, officials and social elites in some African countries seem to be succumbing to Covid-19 at an alarming rate.

Sub-Saharan Africa has recorded about 60,000 deaths out of a population of 1.1 billion, about 40,000 deaths less than the UK.

Africa’s top public health officials have continually said that they are absolutely sure there were no mass death events taking place in 2020. But a dire lack of testing outside a handful of places like South Africa obscures the pandemic's true scale.

Chad, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo have conducted about 600,000 tests on their combined population of about 195 million since the pandemic began. The UK is now conducting roughly that many tests every single day.

How many deaths in Africa rural areas might have gone unrecorded or mistakenly been identified as other common diseases like malaria or pneumonia? It is a question that experts say will probably take years to answer.

But one thing has slowly become apparent. In some African countries, ministers and officials — who tend to be several decades older than Africa’s average age of 18 — are dying or being admitted to hospital at an alarming rate.

Take eSwatini, formerly Swaziland. With its population of 1.1 million, the southern African kingdom is one of the world’s smallest nations. But since the pandemic began it has lost two cabinet ministers and its Prime Minister Ambrose Dlamini to Covid-19.

In South Africa, Zindzi Mandela, 59, the youngest child of Nelson Mandela, tested positive for Covid-19 in July and died shortly afterwards.

More recently, 62-year-old Jackson Mthembu, a much-loved cabinet minister within South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office died of the disease in Johannesburg.

Mr Mthembu played a key part of the African National Congress during its long anti-apartheid fight, was part of the key uprising in Soweto of 1976, and was repeatedly constrained by apartheid courts, detained and forced into internal exile.

Last year, Covid-19 reportedly tore through Burundi's political elite and killed President Pierre Nkurunziza, who had barely acted to prevent the disease from spreading through his country.

The cause of the 55-year-old Mr Nkurunziza’s death was described as a heart attack in a government statement, but many suspect it was Covid-19.

In Malawi, the government was forced to declare a state of disaster last month after two ministers died of Covid-19.

Zimbabwe’s ruling classes also been hit hard. The country’s elite has spent decades looting the country for all its worth, leaving behind a hollowed-out shell of a healthcare system.

With international travel limited and hospitals in many richer countries overwhelmed, four top leaders of the ruling Zanu PF party have reportedly died of Covid-19.

The most famous was the foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo, who died two weeks ago. The 61-year-old famously announced the coup on national television against former President Robert Mugabe in 2017.

“It’s a rude awakening to the government and to the politicians,” said Norman Matara, secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights.

“If you have decades of continuously destroying your public health system, and then now you have a pandemic, you cannot then overturn that decay ... in one year or in six months.”

In Zimbabwe Perrance Shiri, agriculture minister and former head of the country’s murderous North Korean trained 5th Brigade, died of Covid - although this was disputed by his family who claimed he died of food poisoning, after vomiting for hours.

2021-02-02 12:45:54+00:00,6,"Covid-19 survivors may only need one jab, experts have suggested, after two studies found those who have already been infected with the virus had a far higher antibody response following vaccination than those who had had not been infected.

In a study published online late on Monday, researchers suggested that people who have previously tested positive for Covid-19 should be given just one dose of vaccine.

“I think one vaccination should be sufficient,” Prof Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an author of the study, told the New York Times.

“This would also spare individuals from unnecessary pain when getting the second dose, and it would free up additional vaccine doses,” he added.

The study tracked the immune response of 109 people who had received a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, which are both based on mRNA technology.

Of these volunteers, 68 had never been infected with Covid-19 while 41 previously tested positive.

A far “more robust” antibody response - 10 to 20 times higher - was seen in the people who had been infected with the virus compared to those who had not had Covid. In some cases this response even exceeded the level of protection generated in those who had never been infected after two doses of vaccine.

This study also found that those who had been previously infected with Covid-19 reported common side effects more frequently.

Researchers assessed post-vaccination symptoms in 231 people, including 83 who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 and 148 who had not.

People in both groups reported pain at the injection site after the first vaccine dose. But those who had been infected with Covid were more likely to report fatigue, headache and chills.

In a second study - which, like the first, was published online and has not been peer reviewed - researchers at the University of Maryland in Baltimore came to similar conclusions.

The team studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 59 healthcare workers. They identified a “statistically significant higher” antibody response in those who had been previously infected with the virus.

The report concluded: “Our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a) a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed Covid-19; and b) patients who have had laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.”

However, both studies involve small numbers of people and some experts caution that much more research is needed before introducing policy changes.

John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology, told the New York Times that data analysing whether these antibodies were able to stop the virus from replicating is required.

“Just because an antibody binds to a part of the virus does not mean it’s going to protect you from being infected,” he said.

Dr Wherry also noted that rolling out a scheme where those who have previously been infected receive just one dose is challenging. “Documenting that becomes a really potentially messy public health issue,” he said.

Lawrence Young, professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, said further studies should be done.

""If future work can confirm this high level of immunity post a single mRNA vaccine in this group of individuals, this could become a viable option when there are concerns around vaccine supply,” said Prof Young.

Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""These data indicate that the vaccines are very effectively boosting the immunity induced by infection.""

Having been spared the kind of carnage seen in countries such as neighbouring Spain last spring, Portugal now has the world’s highest seven-day rolling per capita average of new cases, according to the data tracking site Our World in Data.

The number of deaths from Covid in January alone – 5,576 – constituted 45 per cent of the total caused by the virus in Portugal since the start of the pandemic.

“We are living through an unimaginable moment. Things are critical, and the situation can only get worse,” Anabela Oliveira, the director of the emergency ward at Lisbon’s Santa Maria hospital told Spain’s EFE news agency.

Santa Maria, Portugal’s largest hospital, has a permanent queue of ambulances stationed outside it these days as space and human resources are stretched beyond the limit, while extra cold containers have been installed to ease pressure on the morgue.

Other European countries are now mobilising to help relieve the emergency situation. On Monday Spain was the latest to offer assistance, with Austria having promised to fly seriously ill patients to some of its hospitals and Germany sending a military medical team to Portugal.

Announcing the continuation of lockdown measures and a closure of the border with Spain, Prime Minister António Costa last week accepted blame for the crisis.

“There’s no point in feeding the illusion that we are not facing the worst moment. And we’ll face this worst moment for a few more weeks,” Mr Costa said, including among the errors made “the way I transmitted the message to the Portuguese”.

I have not seen my in-laws, who live in Egypt, for over a year and I am keen to make the journey.

I approached Axa this week and asked whether pandemic cover would be reinstated once a customer had been vaccinated. It replied that its underwriters were retaining the exclusion. What possible justification can there be for this?

Now that the risk of contacting Covid-19 is a known event that will be with us for some time, insurance companies have tightened up their policy wording to limit their exposure to future claims. Even though you may have been vaccinated, many unknowns remain.

How effective will the vaccine be against new variants of the virus? How long will the protection last? Could you still test positive for the virus while abroad if you chat to an infected local? Although you may not get sick yourself, you may still be required to quarantine for two weeks in a government facility at your own expense and miss your return flight.

Insurers hate unknowns, as it is hard to price the risk, so they will continue to sit on the fence certainly until the current lockdown ends. The hope is that one of the big players in the travel insurance market will break cover by Easter and offer enhanced policies.

Your policy does include some cover for Covid-19: cancellation costs if you are diagnosed with the virus or asked to quarantine before travel, and medical, quarantine and repatriation cover while abroad – unless there is a Foreign Office (FCDO) advisory against travel.

Some insurers, such as Liverpool Victoria (lv.com), are covering unused holiday costs if you are forced to quarantine abroad. However, this cover is withdrawn where there is an FCDO advisory against all but essential travel.

It is hoped that this government-imposed blanket advice, which is not legally binding, will be reviewed in early summer so that British citizens can make up their own minds about the risk and once again be covered by their insurers.

At the moment, your only option for travel to Egypt is specialist cover. Insurance broker Campbell Irvine (campbellirvinedirect.com) offers worldwide single-trip policies for £60-£110 for 17 days, depending on your age. However, these exclude cover for Covid-19.

Insurefor (insurefor.com) does cover Covid-19 if travelling to Europe against FCDO advice. (Europe is defined as including North Africa, Turkey, Georgia and parts of Russia). A two-week single-trip policy for someone in their 70s costs £48. The upper age limit 84.",Telegraph,"['cover', 'fcdo', 'quarantine', 'extra', 'vaccination', 'risk', 'policy', 'covid19', 'travel', 'virus', 'pay', 'vaccinated', 'insurance']",0

Work on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was ""temporarily paused"" at the ""fill and finish"" plant in Wrexham, north Wales, which is run by Wockhardt UK. The company said production schedules had not been affected.

Police were called at 10.40am on Wednesday after a report of a suspicious package delivered to the plant, which employs 400 people. The factory was evacuated and a cordon thrown up, shutting down nearby roads.

An Army bomb disposal unit made the package ""safe to handle"" before work at the plant resumed in the afternoon. Witnesses heard a bang after the deployment of a remote-controlled bomb disposal robot operated by the Royal Logistics Corp, based in nearby Chester.

A source said: ""Unfortunately there are anti-vaxxers out there, which is why security is being taken so seriously at this plant.""

The Wockhardt plant processes millions of doses of vaccine made at two locations in the UK, taking the frozen vaccine, thawing it and putting it into sterilised vials for distribution. Wockhardt has a contract to produce 100 million doses of the Astra/Zeneca jab within 18 months.

Sources said security guards were alarmed on receipt of the package but stressed that it was not viable as a bomb.

Putin's pledge to provide 24 million doses marks a sharp increase from a previous target from last week of 7.4 million doses through March, though some doubts over Russia's production capacity persist.

Russia's vaccine diplomacy has developed goodwill in Latin America after other pharmaceutical companies including U.S.-based Pfizer Inc announced shortfalls in distribution plans.

Lopez Obrador took the call with Putin despite announcing on Sunday that he was himself infected with Covid-19 and was being treated for mild symptoms.

During the first three months of this year, tens of millions of doses are expected in Mexico from the Gamaleya Center, Sputnik V's developer, as well as China's CanSino Biologics Inc, Britain's AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

2021-01-25 13:42:38+00:00,10,"Retired Gurkhas have complained of being ignored by the NHS for Covid-19 vaccinations, despite hundreds of doses apparently going spare near their homes.

More than 400 ex-Gurkhas living in the Greenwich area of London are among pensioners yet to be invited amid questions over the speed of the NHS booking system, The Telegraph can disclose.

Meanwhile, ministers launched an urgent review after the Milly Dowler killer Levi Bellfield was among high security prisoners told they would be invited for vaccines in the coming weeks.

Rajen Kandel, group director of the NHS Woolwich Late Night Pharmacy, said he had enough Oxford vaccine doses “sitting in the fridge” to jab nearly 400 people every day, but only 50 people were being booked in by the NHS daily.

He added that the over-70s overlooked for jabs included hundreds of ex-Gurkhas, many of whom moved to the area after winning the right to settle in the UK in 2009.

“We are here waiting for people but the bookings are not coming through,” Mr Kandel told The Telegraph.

“We have more than a thousand doses of the Oxford vaccine but hardly anyone to vaccinate. The vaccine is sitting in the fridge. Something is clearly going wrong between the central NHS and GPs because these letters are not going out quickly enough. Lots of the people missing out are ex-Gurkhas, and that’s wrong.”

Mr Kandel, whose pharmacy is among 15 in London offering jabs, said his staff had tried to use the NHS booking website to arrange jabs for people aged over 70 including ex-Gurkhas, only to be told they were ineligible.

Prem Jung Shahi, vice president of the Greenwich Gurkha Ex-Servicemen Association, urged the NHS to invite his members to take up the hundreds of jabs going spare.

“It is difficult for us because we know there are vaccines available nearby but the NHS are not sending us the letters,” he told The Telegraph. “The NHS seems to be moving very slowly.”",Telegraph,"['missing', 'exclusive', 'vaccine', 'vaccines', 'jabs', 'going', 'gurkhas', 'nhs', 'exgurkhas', 'kandel', 'doses', 'told', 'vaccinations', 'coronavirus', 'hundreds', 'retired', 'complain']",0

2021-01-23 19:02:15+00:00,22,"As news of his death spread, a surge of anger against the government peaked in China, overwhelming censors. Public memorials to Dr Li were removed but more than a million comments remain posted on his social media account. ‘People are prone to forget,’ wrote one, ‘but I will remember you, not just because you are a martyr, but because of your character and your actions.’

The day after Dr Li’s death, China’s Covid death toll surpassed the 800 fatalities that had occurred during the Sars outbreak in 2002 – an epidemic that may have been exacerbated by an alleged Beijing cover-up.

Enforcing lockdown

The lockdown in Wuhan was ruthlessly enforced. Authorities taped seals around people’s homes, at times chaining them inside. Alarms alerted neighbourhood Party workers every time a door was opened – the only reasons permitted were to receive a package or put rubbish outside the door for people in hazmat suits to collect.

Only vehicles with permits were allowed on the roads, mainly for delivering food and necessities. People were jailed or fined if caught without a face mask or for violating quarantine.

Those with chronic illnesses, including cancer and kidney disease, weren’t allowed out to seek medical care. ‘Everyone [in the hospital] was assigned to work on the front line – we didn’t have a choice,’ says a nurse who did not want to be named. The only other possibility was to resign. She recalls that overcrowding was so severe that it was impossible to isolate confirmed Covid-19 patients from those with suspected cases.

Families arrived with bundles of cash, pleading with doctors for help. Not knowing where to turn, some people jumped off buildings and died.

‘Money wasn’t worth anything at the time,’ recalls taxi driver Wan Dong. ‘All we knew was that people were dying all the time, sometimes alone at home.’

Hao Fangming, 27, an office worker, fled Wuhan hours after lockdown was announced and before it kicked in. ‘I arrived around 4am at Wuchang station, bought the first ticket to my hometown, Zhengzhou, and left,’ he says.

He spent the next 21 days sequestered in his family home and was required to report his temperature twice a day. Officials visited at odd hours to check he was indoors.

Elsewhere, people were increasingly concerned that those who had fled Wuhan would bring the virus to them. Nearly 600 miles away in the city of Guilin, people who had travelled there from Hubei province – of which Wuhan is the capital – were forced to use separate designated public toilets and parking spaces, causing uproar online.

What locals thought of the measures

To the West, China’s lockdowns seemed draconian, but many Wuhan residents praised the government’s handling of the crisis.

‘For years, foreign countries have criticised China for being authoritarian, with people living without freedoms,’ says Hao. ‘But the biggest advantage is that in an emergency, China can speak with one voice.’

He supported the government’s decision to reprimand Dr Li Wenliang for whistleblowing. ‘A big part of their responsibility is to maintain public order.’

Pan Zhilling, 52, a waitress, agrees. ‘China has done much better than other countries. It’s already curbed coronavirus. America’s done so poorly – so many people have died. Everything here now is pretty much fine, not at all what it’s like abroad.’",Telegraph,"['safe', 'appears', 'death', 'lockdown', 'cost', 'wuhan', 'public', 'covid', 'li', 'recalls', 'china', 'city', 'hours', 'dr', 'governments']",0

2021-01-21 17:12:50+00:00,9,"The Covid-19 pandemic has again claimed a new record for its deadliest day, as the number of reported global deaths topped 17,500 on Wednesday.

Covid-19 continues to rage around the world despite the start of vaccination campaigns according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The January 20 toll beat the previous record from 12 days earlier and came as both the UK and the US reported heavy daily tallies of deaths.

The UK government reported 1,820 deaths on the same day, its most yet, and America reported another 4,229 virus-related fatalities, its second highest daily total.

The early stages of vaccine campaigns have yet to tame the winter wave tearing through the northern hemisphere. Governments have warned of more heavy death tolls before anything gets better.

A widely watched model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicts global deaths staying at a similar level for the next week or so, before dropping in early February.

America continues to record the worst outbreak in the world and a forecast from the Centers for Disease Control estimated that the US death toll could hit 508,000 by February 13.

Mexico, another of the world's most badly hit countries, recorded a second consecutive day of Covid-19 deaths topping 1,500.

The World Health Organization's most recent weekly analysis said some 4.7 million new cases were reported in the week to Sunday, January 17, a decline of six per cent from the previous week. Yet the number of new deaths had climbed to a record high at 93 000, up nine per cent from the previous week.

Joe Biden's new administration meanwhile said it would join the WHO's international scheme to deliver vaccines to poorer countries, after Donald Trump quit the agency and shunned the Covax initiative.

Dr Anthony Fauci, told the WHO on Thursday that the new White House would remain a member of the UN agency.

“This is a good day for WHO and a good day for global health,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “WHO is a family of nations and we are all glad that the US is staying in the family,” he added.

The first consignments of vaccines paid for under the Covax scheme are due to be shipped in February.

“We welcome the decision by the United States to join the Covax facility, because vaccinating our own populations is not enough scientifically or morally,” Britain's ambassador, Julian Braithwaite, told the WHO board.

“We need a global vaccination campaign if we are to overcome this global pandemic.”

2021-01-21 13:03:15+00:00,7,"Vaccine passports for holidaymakers will soon be ‘unavoidable’ as more countries make Covid immunity a condition of entry, a leading travel health expert has claimed.

Dr Richard Dawood, a specialist in travel medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic in London, also suggested that tight border controls will remain in place while countries feel ‘insecure’ about the risks posed by the virus.

“Regardless of how any of us feel about the idea of ‘vaccine passports’ for travel, they will ultimately be unavoidable,” said Dr Dawood.

“Once countries begin insisting on proof of Covid immunity from arriving travellers [as the Seychelles has done], there will be little option but to embrace the challenge.

“We all long for travel to return to normal. But entry requirements will remain as long as countries feel insecure, perhaps until most people have been vaccinated worldwide. Social distancing, sanitisers, face masks on flights, delays, red tape, and last-minute changes of plan, will stay a fact of travel until then.”

The EU will debate vaccine certificates for travel within the bloc today, while holiday firm Saga has already confirmed that customers will need to prove they have been inoculated.

But the issue remains controversial, with some commentators expressing their doubts about the ethics of coercing people into getting vaccinated.

Writing for Telegraph Travel yesterday, the CEO of Doctorcall, Dr Charles Levinson, said: “How we balance the risk in terms of immunity passports is a question for the politicians. It’s fraught with difficulties and using any form of coercion for a medical procedure is deeply questionable.""",Telegraph,"['vaccine', 'travellers', 'insecure', 'countries', 'remain', 'immunity', 'long', 'travel', 'passports', 'feel', 'unavoidable']",0

Mathematicians calculated that each student infected would have, on average, passed the disease to just under one other household member – or 0.94 people.

Professor Paul Harper and colleagues predicted the number of new infections using variables including the prevalence of the virus; the probability of secondary transmission; the number of household occupants and the total number of students returning home.

“With the potential movement of over one million UK students for the Christmas vacation, even a modest one per cent infection level (meaning 10 in 1,000 students are infected, perhaps many of them without symptoms at the time of travel) would equate to 9,400 new secondary household cases across the country,” said Prof Harper.

Students were responsible for a big spike in coronavirus cases when they returned to university in the autumn, and the Government was worried that they may take the virus home again during the Christmas break.

To try and combat the problem, universities mass tested their students using lateral flow devices which give a quick result, similar to a pregnancy test, and do not require a lab to process the results.

However, before Christmas, experts warned that lateral flow testing was prone to producing large numbers of false negatives, and research by Birmingham University found the tests had picked up just three per cent of infections. A pilot in Liverpool also missed 60 per cent of positive cases, including 30 per cent of the most infectious individuals.",Telegraph,"['household', 'returning', 'infected', '9000', 'university', 'cases', 'result', 'covid19', 'virus', 'using', 'cent', 'christmas', 'students', 'number']",0

Mr Biden plans to rejoin the Paris climate accord, end Donald Trump’s travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries and order masks to be worn in federal buildings.

The passport, created by biometrics firm iProov and cybersecurity firm Mvine, will be issued in the form of a free app allowing users to digitally prove if they have received the vaccine.

The trial will be overseen by two directors of public health in local authorities and will be complete in March. However, the locations have yet to be agreed.

Innovate UK, the government’s science and research funding agency, has pumped £75,000 into the project.

The aim of the trial is to show how the passports can be used to help the NHS keep track of the number of people that have received the first or second dose of the vaccine.

Frank Joshi, director and founder of Mvine, said the company first began working on the passes to demonstrate test results but had since acquired more funding to pivot into vaccination passports.

“The idea is that we are there ready and waiting in the event that we find ourselves interested in a situation where we need to prove something about ourselves,” he said.

Labour data - more reliable than migration statistics - suggest a drop of more than half a million in the number of foreign born residents in the year to last September, authors Michael O’Connor and Jonathan Portes said.

But they added that the Office for National Statistics had not adjusted population projections to take account of Covid-19 emigration, which exaggerated the number of UK workers in figures.

Their own estimates adjusting for emigration, which they called “a much more plausible picture of recent developments”, showed that instead of a rise of 350,000 in 2020, the total population “falls by more than 1.3m”.

“While the total population was almost flat in the late 1970s, if this is even close to being accurate, this is the largest fall in the UK resident population since World War 2,” the authors wrote.

The impact is felt largest in London, where the economists estimate the capital’s population may have fallen by almost 700,000 - echoing the 1970s exodus which saw central London’s population fall 20pc.

“Big shifts in population trends in London, driven by economic changes and events, are by no means historically unprecedented… so the picture of sustained growth driven by international migration is relatively recent. If this has now reversed, the medium to long-term implications for London will be profound,” the report said.

The adjusted population estimates also helped explain why official unemployment remains so low at 4.9pc despite the economic shock of Covid.

The latest surveillance data from Public Health England (PHE) reveals that, in the week to January 14, there was the second highest weekly total since records began in April.

On Thursday night, senior figures said the numbers were ""shocking"" and warned: ""Care homes cannot be neglected again.""

It came as the Government closed Britain's borders to Portugal and South America amid fears over a new strain of the virus from Brazil.

Ministers had pledged that all care home residents would be vaccinated by the end of this month, but The Telegraph has been told the care home rollout is taking longer than the Government had anticipated. Sources said only 100 residents could be vaccinated in the time it took to administer jabs to 1,000 people in the community.

On Thursday night, PHE said more than one third of people aged over 80 in England had been vaccinated, accounting for 56 per cent of the 2,371,407 vaccinations given up to January 10.

But one senior manager at Aviva, home alone after separating from his partner, did just that last month by setting up a chat on the insurer’s internal messaging system, Yammer, and inviting colleagues to talk.

Many employers have grappled to put in place formal support for workers struggling with the stress or loneliness caused by repeated coronavirus lockdowns. But Danny Harmer, Aviva’s chief people officer, says “giving people the space to be human and support each other” is just as important.

Almost two in three workers at small and medium-sized enterprises feel their mental health has suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new research by Purbeck Insurance Services.

The survey found that 66pc of women and 62pc of men have battled with poor sleep, stress and anxiety or feelings of isolation, depression or anger.

The findings back up a wider report by Aviva last month which showed 58pc of employees had neglected their physical wellbeing since the Covid-19 outbreak due to work pressures. Almost as many, 55pc, had failed to look after their own mental wellbeing.

2021-01-14 14:05:36+00:00,42,"The UK delivery schedule and vaccine storage locations have so far been kept secret by the Government, with ministers and officials warning of security risks due to the vaccine being a “valuable commodity.”

There is also concern that disclosure would lead to vaccine manufacturers, such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, facing a backlash from other countries who have not secured as good a deal as the UK.

During a UK-wide call recently, leaders of the three devolved administrations were urged to keep details of vaccine supplies to their countries secret, with officials warning of the risk that an international backlash opened up the risk of future supplies being diverted.

But on Wednesday evening the Scottish Government published a deployment plan online, from which it was possible to estimate approximately how many doses are being readied for distribution across the UK this month. It also provided rough estimates all the way up to May.

The document has now been retracted, with the Scottish Government publishing a new version on Thursday evening which omitted sensitive supply figures, but insiders have warned that the “damage has already been done.”

Following the publication, The Daily Telegraph understands that Department for Health officials and members of the vaccine task force held emergency talks to discuss their response.

In a bid to reassure vaccine manufacturers, Nadhim Zahawi, the minister in charge of the rollout, is also understood to have contacted Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca.

A Government source said: “There are security concerns. It’s a highly valuable commodity. Officials in the taskforce and DH were on a huge mission last night to reassure manufacturers and suppliers.

“Hopefully people understand the reason why we can’t do this. It’s a security concern but also there is a need to protect suppliers who will be under pressure from other countries due to the sheer volume we have in this country.”

Speaking at her daily Covid briefing, Ms Sturgeon said: ""We published a vaccine deployment plan yesterday, of which a lot of detail has been temporarily taken off the website.

""We were seeking to be and think it is important to be very transparent around all aspects of this, to be clear on the targets we are setting for the numbers of people vaccinated, then to get people as much assurance as we can, subject all the caveats that we still have to put in place about the supply flows that we're expecting.

""But the UK Government's got some commercial confidentiality concerns about that so we're having a discussion with them about what can be published.""

Pressed on whether the disclosure would lead to other countries putting pressure on vaccine manufacturers to divert more doses away from the UK, she said: ""I'm not convinced of that.

""The UK Government have been talking for a long time about the supplies that they have managed to secure so these are estimates of the supplies have been secured.”

The Scottish Government has also defended Ms Freeman’s naming of the vaccine storage facility, with a spokesman stating that the location was ""already in the public domain"" and the name of the distribution agent was also ""widely known"".

However, Donald Cameron MSP, the Scottish Conservative health spokesman, said: ""Yesterday, the health secretary revealed a secret location that Scottish Government officials wanted to keep confidential.

After a year when most have had to cancel holidays, they are making up for it with longer and bigger summer breaks, often with family from whom they have been isolated through the pandemic.

TUI, the UK's largest tour operator, said half the bookings on its website are currently by the over-50s, previously a smaller market for the company.

Thomas Cook said it had taken more bookings so far in January from those aged over 50 than in any full month since it relaunched its holiday programme in September.

National Express's coach holiday businesses said bookings made by those 65 and over had increased by 185 per cent in the last fortnight compared to last year.

""We launched the brochure for spring-summer 2021 just this weekend gone, and on Monday we took a week's worth of bookings in a day and that's continued so far.

I don’t pretend to be clairvoyant but there was no doubt in my mind that the UK would experience a second wave and that, based on historical evidence, it would be more devastating than the first. And that is being borne out by what we’re experiencing.

I am part of a team that operates a specialist bit of life-support kit called ECMO – extracorporeal membrane oxygenation – which is the last-chance saloon for struggling Covid patients for whom ventilation alone is no longer sufficient.

We were back to some degree of ‘normal service’ during the summer, retrieving two to three patients a week for ECMO, and not all for Covid-related reasons; but now we find ourselves, yet again, retrieving only patients requiring ECMO whom are Covid-positive, and with a much higher frequency.

Timelines are such a blur amid the fog of this ongoing crisis. I can’t remember specifically when they started to pick up again, but some time before Christmas we started doing daily retrievals – from hospitals around London and the Home Counties – and are now doing one or more every day, which is unprecedented.

The lull between the first and second wave has allowed hospitals to accumulate PPE materials and medicines, so that anxiety about having adequate protection is no longer there – in my hospital at least.

Nevertheless, the threat of staff being vulnerable to community infection (as we all are) and at work is still an ongoing concern for the healthcare workforce. In the meantime, me and my colleagues are working longer hours in overtime and significantly more intense on-call hours.",Telegraph,"['rules', 'wave', 'ongoing', 'longer', 'retrieving', 'flouting', 'clear', 'red', 'deaths', 'started', 'abundantly', 'hospitals', 'patients', 'hours', 'link', 'second', 'zone', 'ecmo']",0
2021-01-11 15:01:18+00:00,10,"People with common colds who are testing positive for Covid-19 may simply be asymptomatic cases, experts have said.

Trademark symptoms of seasonal flu could be mistaken for symptoms of Covid-19 if the individual tests positive for the virus, it is claimed.

More than eight in ten people who test positive for coronavirus show none of the main symptoms at the time they are tested, a major study by UCL previously revealed.

However, those who test positive when they have cold symptoms may mistake them as being a part of the virus - adding to fears that it is taking a new guise as fresh strains emerge.

Caroline Relton, professor of epigenetic epidemiology at the University of Bristol, said the link being made between common cold symptoms and Covid-19 it is likely to be a feature of increased testing.

""Given the usual colds and respiratory infections seen more frequently in winter months it is unsurprising that people are seeking Covid-19 tests to check whether these may be related to this virus,"" she told The Telegraph.

""It is likely that these tests are revealing what would otherwise be asymptomatic infection (left undetected as it is not possible to seek a test in the absence of the main symptoms). I think this explanation is much more likely than SARS-CoV-2 evolving to have symptoms more like the common cold.""

Evan Kontopantelis, professor of data science & health services research at the University of Manchester, agreed: ""We have already seen mutations but I haven’t seen any evidence on mutations with milder/different symptoms.

""So if I had to pick one I’d go with asymptomatic cases happening to have a cold as well -certainly plausible considering the weather currently.""

However, others suggested it is possible the virus is evolving and manifesting itself as the common cold in some people.

Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, said: “It is possible that the UK variant is associated with different/milder symptoms. We need more data. We don’t know whether the UK variant affects the levels of asymptomatic infection or disease severity. It is possible that the virus will change over time to become less pathogenic.”",Telegraph,"['cold', 'colds', 'symptoms', 'cases', 'university', 'tests', 'experts', 'possible', 'positive', 'covid19', 'common', 'asymptomatic', 'virus', 'reveal', 'testing', 'simply']",0

A growing chorus of politicians, including Conservative and opposition MPs, is also urging the Government to go further.

Sir Keir Starmer warned on Sunday the rules “may not be tough enough” and former Tory health minister Dan Poulter, an obstetrics and gynaecological doctor, weighed in to say ministers need to “put in place tougher measures”.

Fewer than 10 preschool teachers and 20 schoolteachers in Sweden were admitted to intensive care suffering from the virus up until June 30, data from the country's Public Health Agency reveals.

This equates to 19 in every 100,000 teachers overall, according to the research.

Despite Sweden keeping schools open at the height of the pandemic, there was also a low incidence of severe Covid-19 among children, with only 1 in every 130,000 being admitted to intensive care with the virus.

The study was conducted by Swedish researchers and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Sweden adopted a very different strategy to tackle Covid-19 compared with many other countries, choosing to avoid a full-blown lockdown.

In addition to keeping schools open, shops and restaurants also remained open across the country, with parks and recreational areas packed with groups enjoying the spring sunshine.

The government only banned events with more than 500 participants, issuing a recommendation that those who visit pubs and restaurants should be seated at a table rather than mingling at a bar.

People taking public transport were advised to ""think carefully"" about whether their journey is necessary.

Those who fell ill with coronavirus-like symptoms only needed to wait two days after they felt well again before returning to work or school.

However, as early as March 10, a group of doctors and researchers wrote a joint opinion piece in Sweden's leading medical newspaper warning of a potential ""disastrous impact"" on Sweden's health service if tougher actions were not taken.

""I get the feeling that they want to spread the infection to get an immunity, but it's pretty cynical because it will be at the price of hundreds, if not thousands of lives,"" said Olle Kämpe, a professor at Sweden's leading medical university the Karolinska Institutet, who was among the authors.

Andy Eyles, a research economist at the Centre for Economic Performance, added: “The Government has been fairly radical with the furlough.

The Sunday Telegraph can also reveal there are at least 10,000 fewer patients in hospitals being treated for non-covid issues today than the middle of last month, as doctors increasingly prioritise people with Covid-19.

New figures show the majority of patients in nine hospitals in general and acute wards are being treated for the virus, while three times as many frontline health care workers are off sick than normal for this time of year.

Doctors and medics have warned it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep other services open. Dr Tom Dolphin, a British Medical Association (BMA) council member, warned: “Hospitals are trying to increase capacity by reducing elective work to almost nothing but it feels that won’t be enough.”

According to the leaked NHS England cancer resilience plan, London needs to treat more than 500 cancer patients a week to stay on top of demand, but only 122 cancer cases were treated in the city’s NHS hospitals this week, with another 101 being seen in private hospitals.

Cancer operations are also being delayed in other parts of the country, as regional hospitals begin to suffer the impact of the surge in Covid cases. One senior consultant at a hospital in the Home Counties added: “We are trying to move non-Covid work to private hospitals and not cancel cancer surgery, but inevitably routine surgery will be cancelled, as is already happening in some areas.”

Data analysed by this newspaper shows there were around 10,000 fewer non-Covid patients being treated at NHS hospitals in England last week.

There were an average of 56,126 non-Covid patients in general and acute beds each day in the week ending January 5, compared to 19,878 Covid patients, or a ratio of 2.8 to 1.

That compares to a daily average of 65,324 non-Covid patients to 11,334 Covid patients, or a ratio of 5.8 to 1, on December 13.

There are 32,294 coronavirus patients in UK hospitals on Friday across all words, including intensive care units - more than 50 per cent higher than the peak of the first wave in spring.",Telegraph,"['treated', 'england', 'week', 'work', 'nhs', 'covid', 'cancer', 'collapse', 'treatment', 'hospitals', 'noncovid', 'patients', 'coronavirus', 'overwhelms']",0
2021-01-09 21:20:42+00:00,37,"The drugs companies have dismissed suggestions they cannot supply the vaccine quickly enough. Pfizer has about five million doses available in vials and ready for use in the UK, while AstraZeneca has four million in vials, of which 3.5 million still need safety approval from the MHRA before use.

A further 15 million doses are frozen and stored in bulk, waiting to be shipped and then defrosted and put in glass vials in a process known as ""fill and finish"".

Ministers and officials had suggested that a shortage of vaccines threatened to disrupt the roll-out, but the drugs companies involved in the manufacturing chain are adamant supply is on track.

Suggestions of issues with such mundane items as the acquisition of tens of millions of glass bottles to contain the vaccine doses have been scotched.

Pfizer said its supply was on track, while AstraZeneca said it had also experienced no delays. Oxford Biomedica, the main manufacturer of the ""raw"" vaccine in the UK for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, said it was running at full production, having stepped up its manufacturing in October.

The frozen vaccine is then sent to ""fill and finish"" plants outsourced by AstraZeneca, including the main hub in the UK at Wockhardt, in Wrexham. That stage of the process takes less than a week, according to AstraZeneca, including a day or two for the large-scale vaccine to thaw before it is put in sterilised vials.

Wockhardt said its production processes were running as planned. A source said: ""It isn't experiencing any supply issues with regards to vials. Wockhardt is operating on a 24/7 basis to supply the fill-finish process of the Astra-Zeneca Covid-19 vaccine to the NHS for the UK Government.""

Health sources have said that the vaccine was never going to be rolled out at two million jabs a week from the get-go. Sources said launching the biggest mass vaccination programme in history from scratch was always going to be a difficult logistical exercise that would take time. Mr Johnson may not have time.

But there will be anxiety that MHRA checks may hold up an already difficult process. It is unclear how the MHRA was able to approve 500,000 Oxford doses within hours of giving the vaccine emergency approval just after Christmas but that 3.5 million doses – many days later – are still awaiting batch clearance.

An MHRA spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with the manufacturer, AstraZeneca, to ensure that batches of the vaccine are released as quickly as possible.""

The MHRA added: ""Biological medicines, such as vaccines, are very complex in nature and independent testing, as done by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, is vital to ensure quality and safety.

""NIBSC has scaled up its capacity to ensure that multiple batches can be tested simultaneously, and that this can be done as quickly as possible, without compromising quality and safety.""

The MHRA pointed out batches can contain ""many thousands of doses"" and that ""the production of complex biological medicines, such as vaccines, cannot be controlled in the way it can for chemical-based medicines like paracetamol"". It meant t""in-depth laboratory testing for quality of the final product is needed"".

The figures are startling, and look likely to get worse. A further 1,325 people have died with coronavirus within 28 days of testing positive - the highest number of UK deaths reported on a single day since the pandemic began. The number of cases reported in the past 24 hours was 68,053 - also a record. It comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan declared a ""major incident"" over the increase of cases in the capital's hospitals. One in 30 Londoners now has Covid-19. Mr Khan said: ""The situation in London is now critical with the spread of the virus out of control."" Major incidents have previously been declared in London for the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 and the terror attack at Westminster Bridge.

The one slightly positive outcome of all this - if that can even be suggested - is that anti-vaxx sentiment is declining. Government data has shown public opinion is being swayed by fears of overwhelming the health service and celebrity endorsement of Covid vaccines. Another ray of light among the bleak headlines is that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK by the independent medicines regulator, although supplies will not arrive until the spring. The Moderna jab has been shown to be 94 per cent effective in preventing disease. Here is a guide to how the vaccine will be rolled out.

2021-01-08 12:55:33+00:00,8,"Which vaccines has the UK ordered?

The UK has ordered vaccines from:

Oxford/AstraZeneca

Pfizer/BioNTech

J&J/Janssen

Novavax

Moderna

GSK/Sanofi

Valneva

The Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are currently in use in the UK, and the government announced on May 28 that 20 million doses of J&J have now been ordered. Additionally, Novavax has published phase three data and looks set to be approved soon. The GSK/Sanofi and Valneva jabs are still in development.

How effective are the vaccines?

Going by clinical trial results alone the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs have the highest efficacy – scoring 95 per cent and 94.1 per cent respectively. However, as data from mass administration of the vaccines begin to emerge we are getting a clearer picture on the real-world effectiveness of all of the jabs.

For example, data from Public Health England in May showed that both the Pfizer and the AstraZeneca jabs prevented 90 per cent of infections in the real-world after both doses.

That's actually even better than the AstraZeneca jab's trial efficacy results, at 76 per cent after one dose and 82 per cent if the second dose is given 12 weeks later.

Other vaccines do not yet have such strong real-world data to back up trial results.

The J&J vaccine – which was tested in the United States, South Africa and several Latin American countries – had 66 per cent efficacy overall, but this varied depending where it was tested. For example, in the US the vaccine achieved 72 per cent efficacy, but in South Africa – where a new variant was running rampant – it was just 57 per cent.

But, Dr Anthony Fauci, leader of the US response, pointed out that none of the trial participants who took the vaccine – either in the US, South Africa or Latin America – were hospitalised or died.

“The most important thing is to keep people outside hospital and prevent them getting severe disease,” he said.

What about efficacy among older people?

Older people are at more risk from Covid but immune responses tail off as people age and vaccine efficacy wanes.

Most of the studies that looked at different age groups only compared over 60s and over 65s to the rest of the study population – but there is a world of difference between a healthy 60-year-old and a 90-year-old chockablock with comorbidities.

And the number of older adults included in trials were too small to draw firm conclusions. Several European countries, including France and Germany, initially said the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be given to the over 60s or 65s – this is because of a lack of evidence in this age group, rather than because they think the jab is ineffective. France has now revised this guidance and does recommend the use of the jab in older adults with comorbidities.

Moreover, the real-world data from the UK is beginning to prove that doubts over the jab's effectiveness among older people are unfounded, with a study from March showing that a single dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine provides a high level of protection against severe disease in the most vulnerable age-groups, with approximately 80 per cent protection against hospitalisations in the over 70s.

How long does immunity last after vaccination?

There is currently no reliable test to indicate how long immunity lasts after any of the vaccines. The only clue we can get is to look at immunity conferred by the virus itself, with various studies suggesting it lasts several months. One study last November suggested it could last at least eight months or even years.

Reinfection has also – so far – been relatively rare and a UK study of 20,000 health workers in January showed that immune responses from past infection reduce the risk of catching the virus again by 83 per cent for at least five months.

However, immunity against other coronaviruses - such as the common cold - wanes over time so booster shots are likely to be needed as most experts believe this virus is not going away. The emergency of new variants may also make further jabs necessary, and the UK is now actively investigating this area.

How effective are the vaccines against the variants?

Two doses of a coronavirus vaccine seem to be effective against the Indian variant, Matt Hancock confirmed on May 27. Dr Jenny Harries added that ""we are seeing very, very strong vaccine effectiveness after the second dose"", with Pfizer around 80-90 per cent effective.

While AstraZeneca has lower effectiveness against the dominant variant, the Indian strain, early data reveals AstraZeneca vaccine immunisation improving after the second dose.

At the moment, it is important to point out that all of the vaccines continue to provide adequate protection against severe illness and death caused by all of the ""variants of concern"" - the so-called Kent variant (B.1.17), the South African variant (B.1.351), the Brazilian variant (P1) and the new Indian variant (B.1.617.2).

In some cases, the effectiveness of the vaccines against the variants is reduced, but they do still work; experts say it is better to think of immunity as a sliding scale, rather than an on/off switch. Moreover, even if the vaccines only offer, say, 50 per cent protection against the variants, that is better than nothing.

Some manufacturers have also created ""tweaked"" jabs. The Moderna vaccine, the first to be tested, has been shown to be effective against the Covid-19 variants.

Second-generation vaccines are also currently in development, with UK and German firms GSK and Curevac collaborating on a multi-valent vaccine that can be used against several strains.

What about ease of use?

Other considerations should also be taken into account when comparing vaccines.

The Pfizer vaccine now no longer needs to be kept at deep freeze conditions - between minus 60 and 80 degrees Celsius - and can be stored in a standard medical freezer at between -15C and -25C for as long as two weeks.

However, other vaccines - including AstraZeneca - can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures.

The J&J vaccine is administered in just one shot – although the company is also trialling a booster dose – so would be appropriate for remote locations or where transport is a challenge.

The government has ordered 20 million doses of J&J, which will be used to target ""hard-to-reach"" groups in the vaccine rollout, such as those who may be reluctant to come forward for two jabs. Additionally, the Janssen vaccine will potentially be used as part of a booster programme later in the year.

The AstraZeneca vaccine is cheap and is being made available at cost to low and middle income countries in perpetuity.

Do they have side effects?

The main side effects from vaccines are immediately post vaccination and include tenderness, swelling and/or redness at the injection site, headache, muscle ache, fatigue and fever.

However, there have been concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine after several European countries reported a link between it and a rare, but serious, kind of blood clot. Several European countries, like Norway, have since suspended their use of the shot. Others, like the UK, have weighed up the risks and recommend that people aged under-40 get a different jab where possible.

Overall, both the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the British and European regulators, agree the vaccine is ""safe and effective"" and its benefits outweigh the risks, but recommend that the clots should be listed as a ""very rare"" side effect.

The UK regulator says anyone who experiences a headache for more than four days after having the jab should seek medical attention. People should also get help if they have bruising somewhere other than the injection site after a few days, it added.

There is a similar issue over the rare clots and the J&J vaccine, first discovered in the US, where it is more widely used. However, the EMA says the benefits of this vaccine also continue to outweigh the very rare side effect risk.

Can I buy the vaccine?

Not in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine is currently being offered by the NHS to those over the age of 32.

Representatives of Pfizer have stated that they have no plans to supply the vaccine to the private sector, and private vaccination during the first wave of vaccinations is highly unlikely.

What about cost?

Comparing cost is a murky business – the UK has not published vaccine contract details or costs because of ""commercial sensitivities"" and different countries have negotiated different prices that don’t always make sense. South Africa is paying twice what European countries are paying for the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example.

In December, a Belgian minister tweeted the price the European Union was paying for the leading vaccines which gives some indication over price per dose.

However, recent EU attacks on the AstraZeneca have called into question the decision not to profit from the coronavirus vaccine. In a Telegraph exclusive, Sir John Bell of the AstraZeneca team warned that the company may decide to stop charging the vaccine at cost price due to damaged team morale.

Oxford/AstraZeneca: €1.78 (£1.61)

Johnson & Johnson: $8.50 (£6.30)

Sanofi/GSK: €7.56 (£6.63)

Pfizer/BioNTech: €12 (£10.53).

CureVac: €10 (£8.77)

Moderna: $18 (£12.96)

What do we know about China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines?

Sinovac is one of four Chinese vaccines to have reached the last-stage human trials, a higher number than any other nation in the world.

Along with Sinopharm, it is now being rolled out across the world. Some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines after past scandals over Chinese-made drugs and vaccines.

Clinical trials in Brazil reported on Jan 13 that Sinovac was 50.4 per cent effective, only slightly above the World Health Organisation's minimum standard of 50 per cent.

On Jan 11, Indonesia became the first country outside China to grant emergency approval to Sinovac’s vaccine, amid surging infections and deaths, followed two days later by Turkey. Interim data showed it is 65.3 per cent effective, Indonesia's food and drugs authority said.

Sinopharm was approved by the World Health Organisation for use in May, which concluded that the data showed it had an efficacy of 79 per cent. It is now considering Sinovac for use, too.

This on-campus, university-owned accommodation costs £167.50 per week, including bills. At the University of Sussex term usually starts on January 4th, however this year students like Vanessa will not be returning to campus until at least February 15th, which means Vanessa will be wasting £1,008 on empty accommodation. She is expected to pay £2,155 on January 12th to cover rent for the second term but argues this is no longer fair.

So far Vanessa has received no communication from the University and feels like she’s being punished for sticking to the rules. “It’s really frustrating that the government is offering absolutely no support at all.”

She claims the stress of the situation has really affected the quality of work she and her flatmates have been able to produce. “The situation is really distracting and it’s hard to focus on getting any assignments done. It feels like there is a lack of empathy from the university and it’s hard to motivate yourself to work; we’re being neglected.” As a result of the lockdown, students are unable to access on campus facilities exacerbating the problem.

Vanessa is not alone in her frustrations and claims “I don't think I’ve come across a single student or parent who is happy with the University at the moment”.

Evie Mcknight, a fresher studying Arabic and Spanish at the University of Manchester is paying £160 a week to live in Fallowfields, Unsworth Park.

The university is expecting us to act like adults but are treating us like children.”

Last term, Evie went home during the November lockdown and was refunded with up to four weeks’ worth of rent. She is hoping that her rent will be refunded again. It feels silly to be paying full price when “I haven’t met anyone on my course and haven’t seen the inside of a single lecture room”. She admitted “I feel so guilty that my parents are paying thousands of pounds for my rent when I have only spent a month at university.”",Telegraph,"['work', 'rent', 'vanessa', 'university', 'feels', 'accommodation', 'really', '1000', 'paying', 'cant', 'term', 'situation', 'students', 'joke']",0
2021-01-05 21:50:47+00:00,26,"Covid-19 patients could ultimately be selected for treatment by “lottery” or their potential to contribute to society if the health service becomes overwhelmed, according to a draft emergency triage protocol drawn up by specialists at a major NHS trust.

The document, first published in the Journal for Medical Ethics in November, is now being urgently circulated among NHS specialists in the absence of national guidance from either the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) or NHS England (NHSE).

The authors stress that the tipping point has not yet been reached but on Monday the Chief Medical Officers for the four nations raised the national alert level to “Level Five” meaning there is “a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days”.

The protocol – drafted by medical, legal and palliative care specialists at the Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust – is the most sophisticated attempt yet to devise an ethical system for rationing care in the event that there are insufficient resources to treat everyone.

“This document is explicitly and only for use in times of inadequate resource, during which we need to change approach, and need a strong ethical framework in order to make fair decisions”, says the protocol.

“When resources are sufficient, decisions are based solely on what is best for each individual patient.

“When resources are insufficient, decisions need to include a broader view on what is ethically fair for the wider community (society).

“This means factors such as fairness to others are included in decision-making”.

The protocol aims to enable “structured, explicit, transparent decision-making in a situation we all hope will never arise”, say the authors.

Prof Tim Cook, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine at Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust, said it was intended as a “practical guide” for doctors working at speed in overcrowded Covid wards and intensive care units should they become overwhelmed.

He stressed it was a draft protocol and not policy.

By providing a step-by-step procedure for ranking and sifting patients it is hoped it will encourage debate and bring consistency and fairness to the ""most difficult of decision making"", he added.

“This document has been produced locally as there is no explicit national guidance”, says the document.

In the event that capacity runs out, the protocol says a “four-stage process” should be followed to decide who should get treatment:

a health assessment which takes into account the patient's survival chances and comorbidities, including alcoholism

patient and family views

consideration of “ethical factors” where the aim must be to “save more lives and more years of life”

a final check by a senior clinician not directly involved in the patient’s treatment

“In summary, assess which treatment options are likely to provide meaningful benefit, discuss those options with patient and family/carers to obtain their views on the benefits and burdens of each option, discuss the ethics of the wider situation and combine this in an overall clinician judgement”, says the document.

The most difficult and potentially controversial proposals would arise where numbers rise steeply and patients cannot be separated by the four-stage process, although the authors predict this would be rare.

“For patients with similar prognosis, who cannot be separated in other ways, a random allocation, such as a lottery, may be used”, says the protocol.

“Other ethical considerations are more complex and opinions differ considerably. Some judge that an individual’s potential to contribute to maintenance of the critical infrastructure throughout the epidemic may be considered in determining priority for allocation of ICU care.

“Others have proposed that people who participate in research to improve treatments or vaccines during an epidemic should be given some priority for treatment”.

Another deeply difficult ethical decision arises, say the authors, where it may make sense to withdraw ICU care for one patient to make way for another with better survival chances.

“There is a reasonably widespread ethical view that withdrawal of treatment from one individual in order to provide it for another may be ethically justified in a resource-limited setting”, says the document.

“However, this is a high consequence action and the legal position in the UK is currently under review. Current advice is to seek an urgent legal opinion”.

A spokesperson for Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Foundation Trust described the draft protocol as a “research document for the purposes of discussion”.

It was not “trust policy and as such there is no related protocol at the RUH”, they added.

Dr Moosa Qureshi, an NHS doctor who has been campaigning to have the government release advice it holds relating to rationing or “population triage”, said there was an urgent need for the Department of Health and Social Care to release national guidance to NHS Trusts.",Telegraph,"['lottery', 'need', 'trust', 'document', 'health', 'nhs', 'protocol', 'event', 'rationed', 'draw', 'doctors', 'covid', 'care', 'ethical', 'treatment', 'patients', 'triage', 'national']",0
2021-01-05 20:49:12+00:00,7,"Covid-19 restrictions might still be needed next winter, the chief medical officer said as it emerged that one million people currently have the virus.

Professor Chris Whitty said the current lockdown would only work if ""all of us buy into this really seriously"", as he warned that the mass rollout of vaccines would not be easy.

On another day of troubling statistics, 60,916 people tested positive for the virus, with another 830 deaths, as the case rate increased by 70 per cent in the space of just a fortnight.

Prof Whitty said the Government and society would have to decide how many deaths they would ""tolerate"" each winter, in the same way that thousands of flu deaths are accepted, because even mass vaccinations will not mean ""zero risk"" from Covid.

Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference that 1.3 million people had now had their first shot of Covid vaccine, meaning a quarter of those in the most vulnerable groups, including the over-80s, would have ""a significant degree of immunity"" within two to three weeks.

The Prime Minister said that, from next week, daily updates will be given on how many people have been vaccinated, adding that the Government would use ""every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and vulnerable"" through vaccines.",Telegraph,"['million', 'lockdown', 'restrictions', 'winter', 'covid', 'needed', 'zero', 'chris', 'deaths', 'vulnerable', 'mass', 'warns', 'whitty', 'vaccines', 'work']",0

More than 1.3m people across the UK have received one of the two approved vaccines so far, although the Prime Minister said this would have to ""ratchet up"" to meet his target of more than two million people a week in order to lift lockdown.

But he gave a cautious timetable as to when that might be, saying only there was a ""prospect of beginning the relaxation of some of these measures"" by mid-February. ""

""I wouldn't put it any more strongly than that,"" he added, noting there are ""a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that.""

He also declined to guarantee that all children would be back in school before the summer holidays, instead saying he was full of ""optimism and fundamental hope"" that things will be different in the spring.

Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, appeared to rule out allowing teachers to jump the queue in order to reopen schools more quickly, insisting the priority list was right to be set by clinical need.

He also raised the prospect of restrictions returning next winter, telling the press conference: ""We shouldn't kid ourselves is that it just disappears with spring.""

2021-01-05 08:32:01+00:00,15,"The Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to close schools will inevitably be greeted by parts of the teaching community as vindication of their row with the Government.

In recent days the major unions have vociferously made the case that face-to-face teaching presented their members with an unacceptable risk from the virus.

""Bringing all pupils back into classrooms while the rate of infection is so high is exposing education sector workers to serious risk of ill-health,” read a joint statement from six of the major bodies on Monday.

They have also argued opening schools would fuel rising infections.

Perhaps understandably, given their core function, the unions have appeared to champion the first argument more loudly than the second.

However, scientifically, it is by far the weaker. In fact, as emphasised by both the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the past two days, the claim that teachers face a greater threat from coronavirus is contradicted by the data.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures from September 2 to October 16 show “no evidence” of difference in the rates of teachers or education workers testing positive for the virus compared to key workers in other occupations.

This was the case even when the number-crunchers analysed different categories of school staff. The chances of testing positive for the various types of education staff in that period hovered somewhere between a quarter and half of 1 per cent.

Infection rates among those working in primary education appeared to be lowest – which could correlate with the fact young children are barely affected by the virus – although the confidence in this finding was weak.

This was noted at a meeting of the Children’s Task and Finishing Group, a subgroup of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), on December 17.",Telegraph,"['schools', 'key', 'greater', 'contracting', 'staff', 'education', 'risk', 'compared', 'teachers', 'workers', 'unions', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'testing', 'teaching', 'evidence']",0
2021-01-04 13:50:23+00:00,5,"But the worry is infection could have occurred last week when the squad trained indoors at Loughborough University or on the 11 hour flight, although there was a degree of social distancing in place on the plane.

England were due to emerge from isolation On Tuesday to begin training outdoors for the first Test but that has been postponed for 24 hours while they await the results of the next round of testing. The players will be tested again on Thursday before travelling from their base in Hambantota to Galle, the venue for both Tests.

Joe Root, the England Test captain, said last week the tour would not be abandoned in the event of a handful of covid cases. England named a 17-man squad and six travelling reserves for the Sri Lanka tour to cover this kind of scenario so losing Moeen, and almost certainly Woakes as well, for the first Test is not insurmountable but if it emerges there are a clutch of positive cases On Tuesday then the series will be in doubt.

There is little wriggle room for delaying the series with England due to fly straight to India from Sri Lanka the day after the final Test on Jan 27. The Test series in India begins just a little more than a week later on Feb 5.

An England spokesman confirmed Moeen will be travelling to Galle to sit out his isolation in a ‘private residence’, enabling him to stay in touch with the England medical team and quickly rejoin the squad once he is allowed out of quarantine.

Remarkably, Moeen is the first England player to test positive for covid after a successful home summer locking out the virus with a strict biobubble. The tour to South Africa in December was rocked by positive tests for the home players and hotel staff. When two England players tested positive, only to be cleared later, the ODI series was called off.

The ECB has employed a covid compliance officer on tour for the first time to ensure biosecure protocols are in place after concerns were raised in South Africa. They have also provided a psychologist to help with mental wellbeing for players.

Given the expense of a chartered flight, around £350,000, it is surprising the ECB allowed the players to travel together in the same car to the airport, a move that may cost Woakes his place in the first Test.

Moeen was unlikely to play in the first Test with Dom Bess remaining the first choice off-spinner and England wanting to combine him with left-armer Jack Leach.

If Woakes tests negative, England will have to decide if he has had enough time to acclimatise to tough conditions after his week in self isolation. If not, then Sam Curran is his likely replacement.",Telegraph,"['england', 'series', 'week', 'squad', 'englands', 'woakes', 'travelling', 'test', 'tests', 'tour', 'positive', 'moeen', 'lanka', 'ali', 'players', 'coronavirus', 'sri', 'doubt']",0
2021-01-04 10:01:32+00:00,1,"The Lanserhof programme is based on the work of Austrian doctor Franz Xaver Mayr who, in the Thirties, suggested that the source of all illness can be traced back to the gut. Clean that up (and out, with lots of Epsom salt) and almost all things improve – including, in my case, exhaustion. Through a combination of partial fasting at night, and easy to digest, highly nutritious cooked alkaline food (eaten with buckwheat toast to encourage chewing), the body has the support it needs to heal.

Simone Reitmair, my wonderful, sunny, Austrian doctor explained: “The body works twice as hard at night. Therefore, you don’t want to burden it with digestion.”

The Lanserhof rolled out its new Covid-19 programme back in May and has seen dozens of patients to date. Symptoms vary from person to person, but extreme fatigue and breathlessness seem to be a common link.

The programme is all encompassing. After meeting with Dr Reitmair (at 7.30am) on the first day, I was advised which tests I should have, beginning with a highly sensitive “micro immune blood test”, which tells you how well your system is functioning and can zero in on details like T3 helper lymphocytes, which are raised in response to a viral infection.

They also strapped me to a high-tech diagnostic computer, which picked up all kinds of details, including the fact that I grind my teeth.

After doing everything short of an MRI, my treatment plan was handed to one of the many efficient ladies at the Blue Sofa medical centre to be typed up. Unlike other guests, I didn’t complain (or demand to change) some of the painfully early appointments.

The treatments had three aims: to calm the nervous system, which goes into overdrive with long Covid; reduce inflammation; and boost the function of mitochondria, which power our body’s cells.

Dr Reitmair explained that the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause extreme tiredness and which I have had before (and which the tests showed was re-activated by Covid), is the neighbourhood bully.

“He’s the boss of all viruses and lives in your cells,” she said. Currently, there is no cure for post-viral fatigue, so the focus has to be entirely on rebuilding the mitochondria, which really struggle after a hard virus such as Covid.

To boost the mitochondria, we first had to purge my sluggish gut of old debris so it could absorb nutrients and supplements properly – hence the infusions that bypass the gut. In addition to daily Epsom salts, I was also sent for a holistic, almost pleasant colon hydrotherapy session with a South African therapist who used to be corporate lawyer. The staff here are top-top…

People with long Covid often have an over-active immune system – this also shows up on their tests – so the idea is to calm it right down.

Frankly, my constantly updated schedule was, of itself, exhausting, and consisted of mineral infusions (vitamin C, the B vitamins, zinc, selenium, amino acids) administered by a nurse in a large, sunny room with other guests. I was also prescribed massage, reflexology osteopathy, oxygen therapy and cryotherapy.

2021-01-03 21:58:35+00:00,8,"The NHS has declined to make a commitment to delivering two million doses of Covid-19 vaccine a week, according to sources, on the eve of the roll-out of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab on Monday.

The health service said the supply of vaccines remained the ""main barrier"" to delivering tens of millions of doses despite manufacturers insisting that doses were being delivered to the timetable agreed with the Government.

In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, Boris Johnson said he expected ""tens of millions"" of doses to be administered over the next three months but was unable to elaborate on how that would be achieved.

The Prime Minister, expected to attend the Oxford jab roll-out at a hospital in England on Monday, said: ""I wish I could give you here and now any sort of elaboration on the figures you have already heard about how we hope to get up to two million a week and so on. I can't give you that yet.""

Health sources have warned against over-optimism and pointed out the huge difficulties in creating an army of vaccinators and the logistics of delivering the biggest vaccination programme in history.

A source said: ""We do have to manage expectations. You cannot just vaccinate two million people a week from nothing.""

The source suggested that an alleged lack of supply was not the only problem, adding: ""The NHS has never said it will deliver a target of two million a week.""

The NHS has already given first doses of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine to over one million people – more than the rest of Europe combined – and is thought to have between four and five million doses of the Pfizer jab in reserve.

Sir Geoffrey was given his first Pfizer/BioNTech jab on Christmas Eve but now expects an appointment for the second dose to be postponed.

The change will allow millions more people to receive the Pfizer vaccine but has caused anxiety among over-80s – just over half a million people in England – who had already received the first jab.

Pfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when two vaccines were given up to 21 days apart, but the regulatory agencies in the UK insist a single Pfizer dose gives 90 per cent protection against Covid.

However, Sir Geoffrey, in comments reflected by many elderly people in a similar situation, said: ""Pfizer has always said give the second dose at three weeks. The big worry is if it goes to 12 weeks, does it still work? And if they cannot answer that with a categorical 'yes', then you have to give the dose within three weeks or it might be useless.""",Telegraph,"['pfizer', 'exclusive', 'vaccine', 'voices', 'given', 'delays', 'weeks', 'sir', 'dose', 'jab', 'fears', 'vaccines', 'geoffrey', 'second']",0

2021-01-03 14:08:35+00:00,5,"While most scientists look at Covid-19 as a viral respiratory illness, Nir Barzilai takes a slightly different perspective. Instead Barzilai, founder of the Institute of Ageing Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, sees it as a disease of ageing.

The grim statistics show that he has a point. In Europe, people over 60 have accounted for 90% of fatalities since the start of August. While the impact of Covid-19 has been universal, older people have been disproportionally affected.

“This virus has no eyes, but it could see immediately who is old and more vulnerable,” says Barzilai.

For Barzilai and other geroscientists – scientists who study the biology of ageing – this represents an opportunity. They have long argued that we need a different perspective for tackling many chronic diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer’s. As all of these illnesses become more common with age, geroscientists have suggested that therapies attempting to reverse some of the cellular mechanisms of ageing, might make older individuals more resilient to a whole range of diseases.

The premise of this approach is that while we typically measure age chronologically, the number of years we have been alive, your biological age says far more about your health. Biological age is indicated through various biomarkers ranging from the length of telomeres – the tips of chromosomes – to changes in DNA expression, and even your gut microbiome.

Some 55-year-olds may be biologically equivalent to 45, making them more resilient to disease, while others may be far older, due to lifestyle or genetics.

Since the 1930s, scientists have identified certain drugs which appear capable of reversing biological ageing in mice. Over the past nine months, the pandemic has provided increasing evidence they may be capable of doing the same in humans. “Covid has moved anti-ageing from hope to promise,” says Barzilai. “The promise is that ageing is flexible, and can be manipulated, is something we’ve shown again and again in animals.”

The eight hallmarks of ageing

Geroscientists have defined eight hallmarks of biological ageing, which when targeted can improve health and lifespan in animals. These hallmarks range from declining immune function, to a decrease in the quality and quantity of mitochondria – the energy factories of our cells – and an impaired ability of cells to perform garbage disposal and remove toxins or viruses.

There are drugs which can target some hallmarks of ageing, including resveratrol - a compound found naturally in foods such as blueberries – but the impact of Covid-19 has sparked particular interest in a cheap, commonly available medication called metformin, which has been used to treat diabetes for over fifty years, due to its ability to lower glucose levels. But recently, epidemiologists have begun to notice people taking it for diabetes also appeared to have reduced rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

When the pandemic began, an early study from a hospital in Wuhan sparked particular interest. It showed diabetics taking metformin were much less likely to die of Covid-19 than diabetics not on the drug. Geroscientists around the world took note.

“Because of the number of people contracting Covid-19, we could gather data on metformin and its impact on reducing mortality, which would otherwise have taken years to collect,” says Vadim Gladyshev, a biochemist at Harvard Medical School.

Soon, further studies yielded similar findings. Doctors at the University of Minnesota found metformin lowered mortality rates across more than 6,000 Covid-19 patients with diabetes, albeit only in women.

Barzilai believes he understands why. In a paper published earlier this year, he showed that metformin targets all eight hallmarks of ageing at the same time. Now, this accumulation of evidence has helped convince investors to provide $75 million in funding for a landmark randomised control trial called TAME.

Intended to begin in June 2021, it aims to see whether giving metformin to older people for four to five years, can give them more years of good health. If this proves successful, it could see metformin licensed by regulators as the world’s first clinically proven anti-ageing therapy.

AI recommendations

In April, Edwin Lam, a pharmacologist at Thomas Jefferson University, was looking at AI-based predictions of potential Covid-19 treatments and found a drug called rapamycin ranked higher than many highly touted alternatives.

Rapamycin is currently used to prevent organ transplant rejection, but geroscientists have been interested in its effects on longevity for decades. It specifically targets a pathway called mTOR, a major driver of many of the cell degradation processes that occur with ageing. Because rapamycin inhibits mTOR, it can help reactivate different parts of the immune system, making them behave like a younger person.

Boston-based biotech company resTORbio have previously shown that forms of rapamycin can reduce rates of respiratory infections in over 65s. They are now conducting a clinical trial in the US, looking at whether giving rapamycin to nursing home residents on a daily basis, could protect them from becoming severely infected with Covid-19. If successful, it could pave the way for rapamycin becoming a new treatment for protecting older people from seasonal infections, and future viral outbreaks.

New hope for Alzheimer’s

The renewed interest in biological ageing as a result of Covid-19, could also yield benefits for other diseases linked to the ageing process, in particular Alzheimer’s. For years, pharma companies have attempted to develop treatments which target the accumulation of amyloid proteins in the brain during the course of the disease.

With Covid-19 increasing the spotlight on how ageing makes people more vulnerable to disease, Alzheimer’s scientists have begun to consider alternative approaches. “I think neurologists are becoming more open to the idea that we have been too insensitive to the ageing context in which Alzheimer’s occurs,” says Jeffrey Cummings, research professor in the department of brain health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Most patients have the onset of their disease in their 80s, where you get this accumulation of multiple adverse influences on cognitive function.”

One particular clue about how to prevent this accumulation may lie in our DNA. As we age, telomeres become shorter, leading to a variety of cell changes. However, in 1984 biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider discovered an enzyme produced in cells called telomerase which naturally prevents telomere shortening, a finding which won them the 2009 Nobel Prize.

Telomerase levels also decline with age, but in recent years pharma companies have begun to wonder whether artificially boosting telomerase through drugs, could prevent age-related diseases.

Seoul-based pharma company GemVax have developed a product named GV1001 which boosts telomerase levels in cells, with the aim of seeing whether it can prevent decline in Alzheimer’s patients and prevent the onset of the disease altogether. In a recent Phase II clinical trial of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s patients, they reported promising results on an assessment tool called the severe impairment battery (SIB) scale. “The results exceeded our expectations,” said Jay Sangjae Kim, chairman of GemVax.

With the major test – a Phase III trial which is set to get underway in 2021 – still to come, the results must be viewed cautiously, but the success of GV1001 has the potential to yield a new frontier of telomerase based drugs for age related diseases.",Telegraph,"['antiageing', 'ageing', 'unlocked', 'age', 'rapamycin', 'pandemic', 'lower', 'called', 'prevent', 'metformin', 'biological', 'covid19', 'alzheimers', 'ways', 'disease', 'older']",0

Nationally, it is the highest rate since late April, when the testing regime was still below 100,000 a day. By mid-December more than 400,000 tests have been conducted each day, on average.

Sequencing the genome of a virus usually takes months, but a team of scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology did so at unprecedented speed, enabling them to share it with researchers around the world. The first human trials of a vaccine – Moderna's mRNA jab – began within three months and 11 months after the genome was sequenced 90-year-old Margaret Keenan from Coventry became the first patient in the world to receive a jab outside a clinical trial.

Pfizer and BioNTech pipped Moderna to the post but to have not just these vaccines but also the Oxford University/Astra Zeneca jab completing clinical trials within less than a year is a remarkable achievement. And there is hope of more vaccines to come as many are still undergoing clinical trials.

2020-12-25 19:12:56+00:00,27,"The spread of the new Covid-19 variant may be “particularly marked” in children, scientists have warned as they say that school closures may be needed to keep the R number below one.

A rapid analysis by the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the variant is 56 per cent more transmissible than other forms of the virus.

The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that even if another national lockdown - similar to the one in England in November - was implemented, it would be “unlikely” to reduce the R to below one unless schools and universities were also closed.

It comes amid growing pressure on the Government to close schools. Downing Street has said that keeping schools open is a “national priority”, but ministers are now considering keeping schools closed for all of January, with teaching unions demanding delays.

Researchers said there is “some evidence that the increase may be particularly marked in children”.

They said that the new variant will lead to a wave of Covid-19 cases and deaths that will peak in Spring 2021 for London, the South East and East of England and summer 2021 for the rest of the country.

Coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths in 2021 could even exceed those in 2020 unless there is a “substantial” vaccine roll-out, which would mean ramping up vaccinations from the 200,000 per week that are being carried out this month to two million per week.

Researchers explained that closing schools in January would delay the peak, which would buy more time for the vaccine to roll out to get underway.

They added that the only way to reduce the burden on intensive care units (ICU) around the country would be a national lockdown plus school closures, combined with vaccinating two million people per week.

This is “the only scenario we considered which reduces peak ICU burden below the levels seen during the first wave”, they said.

Ministers have repeatedly refused to rule out extended school closures. Schools had been due to return on January 4 but Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, has ordered a week of testing and a return on January 11 for most students, with only GCSE and A-Level students returning on time along with vulnerable children and the children of critical workers.

Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics show that secondary school children are the age group in which coronavirus is most rampant.

Rates of infection among those in Year Seven to Year 11 are the highest among the entire population, the official figures show.

Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said scientists hoped to learn much more over the next two weeks – while schools are shut – about how quickly the variant spreads among children.

Prof Ferguson said they were ""working as fast as they can"" to work out whether it is safe to open schools in January and how best to ensure that children do not fuel virus spread.",Telegraph,"['schools', 'week', 'wave', 'school', 'r', 'children', 'peak', 'variant', 'warn', 'necessary', 'closures', 'scientists', '2021', 'national']",0

The new variant is driving a major resurgence of the virus in South Africa, with experts warning that the country is probably facing a much larger second wave.

Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Hancock said: ""Both are contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks.

""We are incredibly grateful to the South African government for the rigour of their science and the openness and the transparency with which they have rightly acted as we did when we discovered a new variant here.

""This new variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK.""

The Health Secretary said both cases and close contacts of the cases have been quarantined, there are immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa and the Government is telling those who have been in contact with anyone who has been in South Africa in the last fortnight that they must quarantine.

He added: ""These measures are temporary while we investigate further this new strain which is shortly to be analysed at Porton Down.""

Over the summer, the Covid pandemic hit South Africa harder than any nation in Africa. Hospitals were overwhelmed and, at its peak, authorities were recording more than 13,000 new cases a day. Now a new variant of the virus — known as 501.V2 — is driving a powerful second wave, making up about 80 to 90 per cent of new cases in Africa’s most industrialised nation.

2020-12-23 15:16:30+00:00,9,"Hot on the heels of the UK variant and the South African variant, coronavirus mutated again – this time morphing into an even more worrying version of the virus known as the Brazilian variant.

Ministers were so concerned that they banned travel from Portugal and South American countries in January.

However, on February 28, officials said six individuals infected with the ""variant of concern"" had been detected in the UK - three in England and three in Scotland.

Health officials are now hunting for a mystery Covid patient thought to be one of the first in the UK to have the Brazilian variant that may spread more rapidly and respond less well to vaccines.

Here is everything you need to know about the Brazilian variant.

What is the Brazilian variant?

There are actually two Brazilian variants. One – known as P1 – was detected circulating in Manaus, northern Brazil, by scientists in December. This is the one the government is most concerned about.

It has several mutations in parts of the genetic code responsible for building spike proteins, which work like little grappling hooks to get into human cells.

Any changes to their design could make it easier for them to attach to human cells, while also making it harder for the immune system to get rid of the virus.

A second one - known as P2 - has been spotted 11 times in Britain and carries a mutation which can bypass antibodies.

Public Health England (PHE) is particularly concerned about the P1 variant because its mutations share hallmarks with the South African variant, which has been found to respond less well to Covid jabs.

Is it more dangerous than the UK and South African variants?

The Brazilian P1 variant carries similar worrying mutations to the UK and South African versions, notably the N501 and E484 mutations that seem to allow it to transmit more easily.

But scientists are particularly concerned because it has emerged in a population that was already approaching herd immunity and should have been protected.

Research published last year suggested that 76 per cent of people in Manaus had contracted coronavirus by October – a level so high it should have severely limited onward spread of the virus.

According to an end of year report from Imperial College assessing the key drivers of the pandemic in the UK–- and the impact of interventions – the “timing of the initial national lockdown was crucial” in determining the death toll in the spring.

Had stringent restrictions been imposed a week earlier, fatalities would have been cut from 36,700 to 15,700. Delaying by another week, by contrast, would have resulted in a death toll as high as 102,600.

Since the early stages of the pandemic Dr Mike Ryan, head of the health emergencies team at the World Health Organization, has urged governments to “be fast and have no regrets” in responding to the coronavirus. “The greatest error is not to move”, he said in early March.

But minutes from the Sage scientific advisory committee, published in May, show that pressure to introduce lockdown was mounting amid experts for at least 10 days before Boris Johnson announced the stay at home order on Monday 23 March.

Much of this pressure came after Prof Neil Ferguson and the team from Imperial published projections estimating that the UK could see 510,000 deaths without intervention, 250,000 with basic mitigation measures and as few as 20,000 if a lockdown strategy was adopted.",Telegraph,"['week', 'dithering', 'coronavirus', 'cost', 'pressure', 'lockdown', 'pandemic', 'spring', 'team', 'published', 'toll', 'lives', 'imperial', 'analysis', 'uk', '21000', 'confirms', 'delay', 'national']",0

On Monday, the Chilean research base confirmed 36 new infections of Covid-19, including 26 members of the Chilean army and 10 maintenance workers.

In a statement, the Chilean army said: “Thanks to the timely preventive action [...] it was possible to relieve said personnel, who, after being subjected to a medical control and the administration of a PCR test [...] turned out to be positive for Covid-19.”

The Chilean army also said that three crew members on a ship providing support to the research centre have also tested positive for Covid-19 since returning to Chile.

The 36 individuals who tested positive at the General Bernardo O’Higgins Riquelme research centre (one of 13 Chilean bases in Antarctica) have since been evacuated to the city of Punta Arenas in southern Chile, where they will now self-isolate.

All major collaborative research projects in Antarctica have been halted throughout 2020 due to the virus, after scientists took swift action to prevent its spread. Some researchers have remained on the continent – around 1,000 were based there over the winter months (our summer) – conducting smaller-scale experiments.

Researchers in Antarctica took quick action to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic.

Belgium has imposed a 24-hour ban on flights and rail links while it assesses the situation.

Italy is prohibiting entry to the country by anyone who had been in the UK in the last 14 days while flights are banned until Jan 6.

Austria and the Czech Republic are also imposing restrictions, with Prague announcing stricter quarantine rules with anyone arriving in the country having spent at least 24 hours in UK territory required to self-isolate.

Austria and Italy have not specified when their plans to halt flights from the UK would take place.

French authorities have announced on Dec 22 that journeys from the UK will be allowed to resume after the coronavirus ban was lifted, but those seeking to travel must have a negative test result.

French transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebarri said: ""Planes, boats and Eurostar trains will resume service as of tomorrow morning (Dec 23).

2020-12-19 16:04:38+00:00,6,"Hot on the heels of the UK variant and the South African variant, coronavirus mutated again – this time morphing into an even more worrying version of the virus known as the Brazilian variant.

Ministers were so concerned that they banned travel from Portugal and South American countries in January.

However, on February 28, officials said six individuals infected with the ""variant of concern"" had been detected in the UK - three in England and three in Scotland.

Health officials are now hunting for a mystery Covid patient thought to be one of the first in the UK to have the Brazilian variant that may spread more rapidly and respond less well to vaccines.

Here is everything you need to know about the Brazilian variant.

What is the Brazilian variant?

There are actually two Brazilian variants. One – known as P1 – was detected circulating in Manaus, northern Brazil, by scientists in December. This is the one the government is most concerned about.

It has several mutations in parts of the genetic code responsible for building spike proteins, which work like little grappling hooks to get into human cells.

Any changes to their design could make it easier for them to attach to human cells, while also making it harder for the immune system to get rid of the virus.

A second one - known as P2 - has been spotted 11 times in Britain and carries a mutation which can bypass antibodies.

Public Health England (PHE) is particularly concerned about the P1 variant because its mutations share hallmarks with the South African variant, which has been found to respond less well to Covid jabs.

Is it more dangerous than the UK and South African variants?

The Brazilian P1 variant carries similar worrying mutations to the UK and South African versions, notably the N501 and E484 mutations that seem to allow it to transmit more easily.

But scientists are particularly concerned because it has emerged in a population that was already approaching herd immunity and should have been protected.

Research published last year suggested that 76 per cent of people in Manaus had contracted coronavirus by October – a level so high it should have severely limited onward spread of the virus.

However, the city saw an unexpected surge of new cases and has now declared a state of emergency, with hospitals reaching 100 per cent capacity.",Telegraph,"['known', 'mutations', 'uk', 'variant', 'covid', 'south', 'brazilian', 'african', 'worrying', 'strain', 'worried', 'concerned', 'p1']",0

The Prime Minister introduced a sweeping new lockdown for swathes of the South East after coronavirus cases soared.

He said that Christmas would be “different” this year but that the sacrifice would mean protecting the lives of the people we love so that we can “see them at future Christmases”.

Mr Johnson said he had been left with no choice after scientific evidence showed that a new variation of the virus was up to 70 per cent more transmissible.

He said: ""I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren, and for families to be together.

""So I know how disappointing this will be, but we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science.

""When the science changes, we must change our response. When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defence.""

It includes a six-month grace period for traders who make mistakes filing additional customs paperwork, as well as a minimum of a year for firms to get used to complying with new rules of origin, the criteria for determining where products come from and if additional tariffs should be applied.

A separate arrangement to ensure the continued flow of data between the UK and the bloc has also been proposed.

Warning that it was now “impossible” for many firms to be ready in time for no-deal, the CBI’s new director-general, Tony Danker, said: “With less than a fortnight until 1 January to get ready, bold steps are needed to minimise disruption.

“If both sides can get a deal and make progress on these critical agreements, it will make a huge difference to economic prospects across Europe, as we enter the new year.”

Their concerns echoed the Federation of Small Businesses, which said on Friday that just one in five firms due to be hit by Brexit disruption were ready for the transition period ending.

Of the 1,500 businesses which were surveyed, less than half said they had experience in handling rules of origin paperwork. Just one in four that have begun preparing have spent more than £2,000 on adjustments.

Calling on the Government to introduce “transition vouchers” or grants of up to £3,000 to help firms buy tech and training, FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: “With only two weeks to go, small firms don’t have the time, money or clarity they need to prepare for the end of the transition period even if they want or need to.

2020-12-18 19:50:34+00:00,9,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday blamed “a moment of bad luck” and negligence for catching Covid-19, while insisting that he usually respects measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The 42-year-old head of state spoke out after being widely accused of flouting his own government guidelines on social distancing.

In a three-minute video posted on social media on Friday, Mr Macron said: “I am very careful. I respect barrier gestures, distances, I put on the mask, I put on [anti-bacterial] gel on a regular basis.”

“And despite everything, I caught this virus, perhaps probably because of a moment of negligence, a moment of bad luck too, but there it is.’

Mr Macron recorded the video at La Lanterne, the presidential retreat at Versailles, west of Paris, where he will isolate for at least a week after being diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday.

A number of European leaders were also forced into isolation after after Mr Macron held a frantic week of meetings across the continent.

Looking tired and weak, and wearing a dark blue polar-neck sweater, he said that he was under medical supervision and doing “fine”.

“I have the same symptoms as yesterday, that is to say fatigue, headache, dry cough, like hundreds of thousands of you who have had to live with this virus or who are living it today.”

France's coronavirus death toll surpassed 60,000 for the first time on Friday, as the health ministry reported 610 new deaths.

The news came as criminal complaints that could result in prison sentences were filed over a dinner organised by the President before his diagnosis.

Health campaigners are furious that he sat down to a meal with up to 10 senior colleagues at the Élysée Palace on Wednesday evening.

Not only was the dinner in the middle after the 8pm curfew in the French capital, it also broke government guidelines limiting the number sitting around a meal table to six.

On Friday, two Paris-based pressure groups called ‘The Collective Victims of Coronavirus France’ and ‘The Hanged’ filed criminal complaints for “endangering the lives of others”.

This is a criminal offence in France – one punishable by up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of €15,000 (£13,600).

Maître Fabrice Di Vizio, the lawyer for the groups, said on Friday that the complaint had initially been filed against ‘X’, meaning it potentially targets anyone who helped organise the dinner, or who attended.

Mr Macon will be excluded from any possible indictment, because as President of France he enjoys immunity from prosecution.

Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, is also likely to enjoy legal privilege, according to those familiar with the complaint.

But those who can potentially be taken to court include Richard Ferrand, the President of the National Assembly, the second chamber of France’s parliament.

Christophe Castaner, the head of Mr Macron’s party in parliament and the former Interior Minister, is also a possible defendant.

Paris prosecutors confirmed that the complaint had been filed.

Only two weeks have passed since life in England shut down - and yet cases are back on the rise and pressure on the NHS shows no sign of slowing down.

That is despite this week's announcements, from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, that London and many areas of the South East will enter Tier 3, the Government's toughest level of local lockdowns, while the vast majority of those already under such rules will stay put for now.

Here are five warning signs in the Covid-19 data that may push ministers into imposing another nationwide lockdown in England.

Cases are again rising exponentially

Last month’s lockdown in England, and measures across the UK, saw a decline in cases for the first time since summer.

A peak of around 25,000 new coronavirus cases a day in the UK on November 10 dropped to 15,000 a day by the end of November, as shops, pubs and restaurants closed across England.

Mr Pence, who is the head of the White House coronavirus task force. called the vaccinations a sign of hope, as the US recorded its highest daily death tolls of the pandemic.

President Donald Trump, who has yet to confirm whether he will be receiving the vaccine, was notably absent from the event, instead tweeting unproven election fraud claims.

""I believe that history will record that this week was the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic, but with cases rising across the country, hospitalisations rising across the country, we have a ways to go,"" said Mr Pence before rolling up his shirt sleeve at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

US hospitalisations have set records on each of the past 20 days, approaching 114,000 on Thursday.

Health experts have warned of a deepening crisis this winter as intensive care units fill up from Thanksgiving infections and as the country braces for the Christmas and Hanukkah holidays.

Beyond the logistical challenge of the most ambitious vaccination campaign in decades, health officials must convince a skeptical public they are safe and effective. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 61 per cent of Americans were open to getting vaccinated.

A number of hosts on television stations including Fox News have expressed skepticism about the vaccine, while others have linked it to conspiracy theories.

Mr Pence being vaccinated publicly ""is symbolic to tell the rest of the country the time is now to step to the plate, and when your time comes, to get vaccinated,"" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to receive an injection on camera on Monday, alongside wife Jill, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff.

""I can't thank May and the NHS staff enough who have looked after me tremendously, and my advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it - if I can have it at 90 then you can have it too.""

A former jewellery shop assistant who retired just four years ago, Mrs Keenan is originally from Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, but has lived in Coventry for more than 60 years.

She described the moment she was vaccinated, in a world-first, at 6.31am.

2020-12-16 17:35:46+00:00,7,"One in 10 people who catch coronavirus go on to suffer “long Covid” symptoms lasting three months or more, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows.

In the first official estimate of the prevalence of lingering symptoms, the study also found that one in five Covid-19 patients suffered symptoms lasting five weeks or more.

Overall, roughly 186,000 people in private households in England in the week beginning November 22 were living with Covid-19 symptoms that had persisted for between five and 12 weeks, the ONS data shows.

When looking at symptoms among people five weeks after testing positive for Covid-19, the ONS estimated 11.5 per cent of respondents were still experiencing fatigue, 11.4 per cent had a cough and 10.1 per cent had a headache.

Some 8.2 per cent were still experiencing a loss of taste, while 7.9 per cent still had a loss of smell.

All estimates are based on responses collected as part of the ONS Covid-19 infection survey, which tests thousands of people for coronavirus whether or not they have symptoms.

This data does not include people staying in hospitals, care homes or other institutions.

The ONS is also investigating Covid-19 complications by looking at GP records, hospital data, deaths and testing figures. To date, it has analysed the healthcare records of patients in hospital with Covid-19 until the end of August.

It has compared their complication rate to the end of September with people in hospital but not with Covid-19. The results suggest patients in hospital with coronavirus have higher rates of metabolic, cardiovascular, kidney and liver disease compared to those without.

Higher rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease were particularly notable, the ONS said.

It added: “While these results do not confirm the presence of a causal relationship between Covid-19 hospitalisation and subsequent adverse health events, they are suggestive of a statistical association that warrants further investigation.”

A small study published in October from the National Institute for Health Research, which is largely funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, suggested that 'long Covid' may in fact be four different syndromes.

These are permanent organ damage to the lungs and heart, post-intensive-care syndrome, post-viral fatigue syndrome and continuing Covid-19 symptoms.

Dr David Strain, co-chairman of the BMA Medical Academic Staff Committee, said: “This preliminary data is very concerning, suggesting that 10 per cent of people who have experienced Covid-19 are left with residual symptoms after three months – more than twice the rate than we previously thought. It also highlights that the majority of people who contract Covid-19 have symptoms for over a month.""",Telegraph,"['suffer', 'months', 'symptoms', 'health', 'weeks', 'covid', 'ons', 'long', 'covid19', 'patients', 'cent', 'coronavirus', 'data', 'hospital']",0

He added: ""We are keeping the laws the same, a smaller Christmas is a safer Christmas and a shorter Christmas is safer.""

Figures from the company, which operates the cash machine network, showed that cash withdrawals were down by 47 per cent year-on-year during the November lockdown, falling from 139 million to 73 million.

This compares to a drop of 60 per cent in April at the height of the first lockdown when a smaller number of people were withdrawing larger amounts of money than normal, the data showed.

Graham Mott, from Link, said the increased resilience of cash usage could be because people are less fearful of the virus and are no longer afraid of being infected by notes and coins.

Research by the company showed that in the summer around 30 per cent of people said they were taking extra precautions when handling cash, whereas that number has now fallen to 17 per cent.

The Bank of England has said that the risk of catching Covid-19 from banknotes is very low as the virus does not survive for very long on that type of surface.

Mr Mott also said that the return to school, prompting quick cash withdrawals on the school run, and the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants had led to greater cash usage.

He added: “We've seen more pubs and restaurants stay open in recent months offering takeaway alternatives.

“I think almost certainly people want to support local businesses, especially the pub, so our thirst for beer and scotch eggs may be one reason we're using more cash.""",Telegraph,"['withdrawals', 'school', 'lockdown', 'scotch', 'usage', 'thirst', 'boosted', 'beer', 'virus', 'cash', 'eggs', 'cent', 'restaurants', 'showed']",0

Parents who fail to send their children to school next week are unlikely to be fined, The Telegraph understands, meaning families will effectively be given a free hand to act as they please.

Geoff Barton, general secretary at the Association of School and College Leaders, said that headteachers will not be minded to fine parents who fail to send their children to school next week.

“What the season of goodwill is definitely not about is sending fines out to parents,” he said.

Ordinarily, children are only allowed to miss school if they are too ill to go in or if they have advance permission from the headteachers.

Parents can be issued with £60 fines if their children are absent with no good reason, which doubles to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. If it is not paid after 28 days, parents face prosecution by their local authority.

But it is up to individual headteachers to choose how they record children’s absence and whether they report it to the local authority.

Downing Street has insisted that keeping classrooms open is a “national priority” and ministers are keen to avoid any more periods of closure after children missed up to six months of school during the national lockdown earlier this year.

The Education Secretary was given emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act to override the desires of a school’s headteacher and governing body and force them to stay open.

Presdales School, which has since confirmed that it will remain open for all pupils until next Friday, was sent a “minded to direct” letter from the DfE and told that unless it backed down it would face legal action.

Government officials are in contact with Essex County Council chiefs in an attempt to pressure them to change course after they announced that they will support headteachers in Basildon who want to move to remote learning next week.

The Welsh Government has told schools to move to online learning from Monday.

In Stockholm, Sweden, which was noted for taking a more relaxed approach to the pandemic in the first wave, parents have been told that all school pupils aged 14-16 will switch to online learning for the rest of the year to try and stem a second wave of the virus.

The Government is also adamant that exams should go ahead next summer, and any further periods of school closures could throw this into doubt.

This week the Scottish Government announced that all exams would be cancelled for the second year in a row.

Mr Barton said that the Health Secretary’s “dramatic” and last-minute announcement about mass testing in schools “may have the unintended consequence of spooking everyone”.

He went on: “There is an increasing sense that young people just aren’t coming into school. I think there will be a lot of parents who will take decisions into their own hands.

“They will just vote with their feet and say ‘I would prefer my children to be at home, I don’t want the risk of my child being in school’.”

On Friday, the DfE sought to reassure parents, with the regional school commissioner for the East and North East of England saying that the testing programme ""is not directly linked to transmission in schools or colleges"".

A DfE spokesperson said: “We are prioritising children’s and young people’s education and wellbeing, by keeping nurseries, schools, colleges and universities open.

“Schools should work with families to ensure children are attending full time. As usual, fines will sit alongside this, but only as a last resort and where there is no valid reason for absence.”

Four of the top five areas with the highest Covid rates in England are centred around the Kent borough of Swale and its Isle of Sheppey, where there are three prisons, one of which had one of the biggest jail outbreaks of Covid-19 this autumn.

2020-12-11 12:49:16+00:00,5,"Who decides when the pandemic is over?

Technically only the World Health Organization has the power to decide if the outbreak still constitutes as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’ (PHEIC), the highest level of alarm under international law.

This label is reviewed every three months by an emergency committee charged with assessing the epidemiological situation within the context of the entire world, not individual regions.

However, as wealthier countries begin to emerge from under the shadow of Covid-19, deciding how and when to declare an end to the pandemic will become more contentious, warned Prof Sridhar.

“Rich countries might say: ‘well, our epidemics are managed’, but the global pandemic is going to be around for a couple of years, until we are able to produce enough of these tools and provide them to all the countries who need them,” she said.

But here’s where it could get complicated...

The word ‘pandemic’ holds no official weight in legal terms, so heads of state might start using it in a colloquial sense to indicate that the outbreak within their borders has subsided.

Politicians, keen to kick start the economy, will be under pressure to call it quits as soon as possible as citizens call for a return to normality, Ms Ottenhoff said.

That means declaring an ‘end’ to the pandemic could become more of a symbolic gesture. This could create confusion or, worse, put lives in danger as people begin to take the disease less seriously.

This label is reviewed every three months by an emergency committee charged with assessing the epidemiological situation within the context of the entire world, not individual regions.

Since the Telegraph Christmas Charity Appeal took on its current form in 1986, it has made a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whose stories have been told in the pages of the paper. During last year’s appeal, the total amount raised by reader donations passed the £25 million mark.

In 2019, the first charity supported was The Silver Line, which provides a telephone friendship service for isolated older people. It also runs a helpline, which older people can call for conversation, information and advice.

Donations from our readers funded 49,000 phone calls to older people, which, in a year that the over-70s were ordered to shield from coronavirus, provided a lifeline to those stuck at home with no one else to talk to. Demand for The Silver Line’s services were higher than ever during the first lockdown, with calls to its helpline (0800 4 70 80 90) up by 30 per cent.

Dame Esther Rantzen, founder of The Silver Line, thanked The Telegraph’s readers for their huge donation, saying: “Covid-19 has caused so much distress and anxiety, especially for older people living on their own, for those who are caring for partners and those who have loved ones in care homes. Thanks to support like The Telegraph’s, we’ve been able to continue offering friendship and a listening ear to those who need us the most during these challenging times.”

The second charity supported by last year’s appeal was Leukaemia Care, which provides emotional and financial support to those affected by blood cancer. The past 12 months have been particularly difficult for people with leukaemia. Many have had to shield due to risk of Covid-19 complications.

The Telegraph’s appeal raised £188,000 for the charity, which was enough to reach 10 million people with information about how to spot the signs of the cancer. Given that leukaemia is generally diagnosed late, this initiative has the potential to save many lives.

Zack Pemberton-Whiteley, CEO of Leukaemia Care, said: “While the world had to temporarily pause, we’ve had to work harder than ever to ensure that the most vulnerable people are the best supported. We’ve continued all of our services during this time, which we have to thank Telegraph readers for.”",Telegraph,"['need', 'readers', 'charity', 'today', 'leukaemia', 'care', 'phonein', 'help', 'supported', 'weve', 'silver', 'telegraph', 'appeal', 'older', '2020', 'telegraphs']",0

Boris Johnson has given Brexit negotiators until this Sunday to avoid a no-deal after a meeting with the European Commission president failed to bridge ""very large gaps"" between the two sides.

“I don’t really have a strong view as to which good vaccine I have, provided it’s safe and effective, which is what the whole (regulatory process) … is there to do.”

Pfizer said the vaccine was ""well tolerated"" during the trials with ""no serious safety concerns"".

A spokeswoman said: ""We have been advised by MHRA of two yellow card reports that may be associated with allergic reaction due to administration of the Covid-19 BNT162b2 vaccine.

""As a precautionary measure, the MHRA has issued temporary guidance to the NHS while it conducts an investigation in order to fully understand each case and its causes.

""In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent Data Monitoring Committee.

""The trial has enrolled over 44,000 participants to date, over 42,000 of whom have received a second vaccination.""

The yellow card scheme is the UK system for collecting and monitoring information on suspected safety concerns or incidents involving medicines and medical devices.

Prof Stephen Evans, professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: “Allergic reaction occurs with quite a number of vaccines, and perhaps even more frequently with drugs. So it is not unexpected.

“The Pfizer data showed that about 0.6 per cent of people had some form of allergic reaction in the trial on the vaccine, but about 0.5 per cent on placebo. So there was a genuine excess of allergic reaction but this was small and the true rate is not known, and there is a lot of uncertainty around that estimate.

“For the general population this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination. One has to remember that even things like Marmite can cause unexpected severe allergic reactions.”

2020-12-08 23:13:42+00:00,3,"When will I get a jab?

The national vaccination programme is currently largely targeting those aged 80 and over who are already in hospital, or have an appointment, as well as care home workers, and some frontline staff.

Next week, it will ramp up the programme from more than 70 hospitals to around 300 GP centres.

Each will be expected to be able to vaccinate 975 patients over the age of 80 within four days of the batch being delivered. Within this age group, pensioners from black and ethnic minorities, and those with underlying health problems, may be prioritised, amid concern that they are most likely to be hospitalised by the virus.

The Government's advisors have drawn up a priority list of nine groups, largely dictated by age. Ministers have said they hope that everyone on this list – which means everyone over the age of 50 plus some younger people with health problems – will receive a jab by Easter.

Health officials have stressed that the majority of those in the at risk groups will not receive a vaccine until January or February.

Should I contact the NHS if I have not heard anything, or try my local hospital?

The NHS insists it will contact those eligible and has urged the public to be patient and wait to be contacted. And people have been asked not to turn up at hospitals expecting to be vaccinated after the first patients were given jabs.

Which vaccine will I get?

At the moment only one vaccine (made by Pfizer and BioNTech) has been authorised by regulators. Britain has ordered 40 million doses, enough for 20 million people, as two doses are required. Ministers say they hope “several million” people will receive jabs by the end of the year. Trials have found this has 95 per cent efficacy.

A second vaccine developed by AstraZeneca, with Oxford University is currently being considered by watchdogs, with hopes it will be approved by Christmas.

Britain has ordered 100 million of these, and they are easier to transport and store. Trials on this found efficacy rates of up to 90 per cent, among those given a half-dose in their first jab.

However, those given the regular dose only saw protection levels of 62 per cent.

Individuals will not be able to choose which jab they get but regulators or health officials could decide that a particular vaccine is best suited to a particular age group.

Why is the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine taking longer to be considered?

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been conducting a rolling review of the vaccine which will speed up the approval process. It took just a fortnight for the MHRA to approve the Pfizer jab from the results first being announced.

It is now more than three weeks since the Oxford results were announced.

However, experts say its data is more complicated, meaning it will take longer for regulators to assess it. An early trial mistake meant one cohort only received half of the first dose, yet that now appears to be the most successful regime, protecting nine in 10 people compared to six in 10 people who got the full two doses.

When the trial was published in The Lancet, researchers said the low-dose findings could not be substantiated without further research leading to fears the MHRA will not approve the more effective regime.

The number of over-55s in the low-dose group was too small to be able to tell whether it will be effective for older people, which will cause another headache for the MHRA.

Will there be further trials of the low-dose regime?

Trials are continuing with the low-dose group, but researchers said there were no current plans to begin bigger trials on this regime

Will the Oxford vaccine still be approved even if it is only 62 per cent effective?

Many vaccines with lower efficacy rates are still approved, as they can still make a large impact across large populations. Effectiveness of the flu jab, which is given annually, varies from season to season, with overall effectiveness of between 30 and 60 per cent.

What difference will vaccines make to our restrictions?

Some research suggests that a vaccine would need to be between 70 and 80 per cent effective before people can safely stop relying on social distancing.

If I have a vaccine can I stop socially distancing and wearing a mask?

No. It is not yet clear whether the vaccines will prevent transmission so even if you’re protected you could still infect others. Until a large number of people are vaccinated, so that herd immunity is achieved, social restrictions will remain in place.

Are other vaccinations likely to be available?

As hospitals across the country began administering jabs to the most vulnerable, the chief scientific adviser suggested that restrictions may remain in place long after its full rollout.

On Tuesday, there were scenes of jubilation across the country, as the programme got underway.

Grandmother Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, was the first person in the world to receive a jab outside of clinical trials, proclaiming it the ""best early birthday present"".

Next week the NHS will expand its vaccination programme, with the Pfizer jabs rolled out beyond 70 hospitals to around 300 GP hubs, targeting those aged 80 and over.

Between 1.2 and 1.6 million further doses of the Pfizer vaccine are due to be delivered to the NHS next week, it emerged on Tuesday night.

The remainder of the four million doses destined for the UK before the end of the year will arrive in a consignment the following week, according to The Times.

2020-12-08 17:19:24+00:00,11,"“Data are most compelling for the cohort who got half a dose of the vaccine in their first jab. Not only does this seem to confer greater protection against disease, it is in this group that there is a reduction in asymptomatic transmission of the virus, something which is essential if herd immunity is to be obtained to get wider protection of the population.

“Unfortunately, this cohort was relatively small, reducing the reliability of the findings – moreover it did not contain any older participants (age 55 or over) and it remains possible that if the regulators allowed the vaccine to be used in this manner, the most at risk group may not be protected.”

Dr Julian Tang, honorary, clinical virologist, Respiratory Sciences, University of Leicester, added: “A lower vaccine efficacy does run the risk of leaving a large proportion potentially unprotected despite being vaccinated.

“Those who have been vaccinated and think they are immune may behave more freely which may serve to spread the virus further if they do become infected.

“The other finding is that there is insufficient data as yet to confirm the vaccine efficacy against those over 55 years old. So if it is licensed by the MHRA, will it just be for the standard dose regimen but only for those aged 18-55 years? Or will they assume some level of efficacy (under 50 per cent) in those over 55 years also, given the current Covid-19 pandemic crisis?”

At a briefing ahead of publication in The Lancet, the vaccine team from Oxford University said they hoped to see regulatory approval ""in the coming weeks"".

But Prof Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity, University of Oxford, appeared to suggest that it would not be enough on its own to bring the pandemic under control and that other vaccines would be needed.

“I think what we need are vaccines in people's arms and I personally think we need to be completely agnostic about which vaccine we use, because we want multiple vaccines, as soon as possible.

“This really can’t be a competition between developers, this has to be a competition against the virus.”

Mene Pangalos of AstraZeneca also said he believed even a vaccine of 62 per cent efficacy would be useful in preventing severe Covid and death.

“I do believe that a vaccine of 62 per cent, which is the minimum we have shown, is still a viable and effective vaccine.

“We have no cases of severe Covid or death so in terms of the impact it will have on the healthcare system done on populations at large. I think it's very important.”

The Lancet study found that the Oxford vaccine ""has a good safety record and efficacy"" following trials on 11,636 volunteers across the UK and Brazil.

Prof Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said: “We hope that this vaccine will shortly be in use to start saving lives.”",Telegraph,"['vaccine', 'vaccines', 'university', 'regulators', 'oxford', 'dilemma', '55', 'severe', 'results', 'warns', 'leave', 'virus', 'cent', 'coronavirus', 'think', 'efficacy', 'scientist']",0
2020-12-08 14:04:41+00:00,4,"A Filipino who arrived in southern Taiwan for work has been fined $3,540 for leaving his room at a quarantine hotel for just eight seconds, violating strict rules designed to control the coronavirus.

The man, who arrived in November in the port city of Kaohsiung, was caught on surveillance camera briefly leaving his room to deliver something to the door of his friend who was quarantining on the same floor, reported Taiwan’s China News Agency, citing the city’s department of health.

The department issued the hefty fine as he was still undergoing a mandatory 14-day quarantine period. Hotel managers have been asked to closely monitor guests due to a surge in Covid-19 cases among people arriving in Taiwan for work or study.

Taiwan has managed to keep its infections total at a low 716 and just seven deaths since January.

The island, which lies less than 100 miles from the eastern coast of China, has been praised for successfully managing the virus through widespread mask-wearing, contact tracing, and, in particular, strict border controls that limit entry and impose 14-day quarantines on any new arrivals.

Since April, there have been no locally transmitted cases and all new infections have been detected in nationals or foreigners arriving from abroad, including multiple cases from the Philippines and Indonesia, which have the highest infection rates in Southeast Asia.

Taiwan suspended entry for Indonesian workers from December 4-17 due to spiking cases in their home country. Meanwhile, under new rules from December 1 to February 28, all travellers entering or transiting Taiwan must provide a certificate of a negative Covid-19 RT-PCR test issued within three days prior to boarding the flight.

Some Taiwan residents pointed out on social media that the fine issued to the Filipino worker was much more severe than the one handed out to four foreign DJs who each received a penalty of $350 for breaching quarantine regulations ahead of a concert in November.

Dr Chuang Jen-hsiang, spokesman for the Central Epidemic Command Centre, said at the time that the DJs had been caught breaking the rules of “one room per person” when one of them uploaded a video of them rehearsing together.

The penalty structure under a special law governing the prevention of severe pneumonia with novel pathogens ranges from NT$100,000 ($3,540) to NT$1 million ($35,400).

In March, a local man was fined more than $35,000 for skipping home quarantine to go out clubbing. The authorities slapped him with the maximum penalty as his night out was deemed “malicious.”

The Telegraph contacted the Taiwanese health authorities who confirmed that a Filipino worker had been fined NT$100,000 and said the penalty was decided by the local government in Kaohsiung.",Telegraph,"['3540', 'rules', 'taiwan', 'cases', 'quarantine', 'worker', 'penalty', 'filipino', 'fined', 'issued', 'eightsecond', 'breach', 'man', 'room']",0

Prof Ian Jones, Professor of Virology, University of Reading, said:

""The data released today add a lot of flesh to the bones of the earlier press release. (The vaccine) is undoubtedly safe and is also capable of preventing disease, so its general roll out would impact the epidemic. Its cost and availability are also powerful positives.

""Data are most compelling for the cohort who got half a dose of the vaccine in their first jab.

Britain has extended an olive branch to the EU. The Government said it is prepared to remove three law-breaking clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill, which is returning to the Commons. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove met his counterpart in Brussels today over lingering Irish border issues. The discussions are in parallel to the Brexit trade deal talks taking place nearby. Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier and the UK's Lord Frost are seeking to break the stalemate - with just over three weeks until the end of the transition period. Mr Barnier told MEPs that Wednesday is the deadline for a deal - but that might not be the true cut-off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen are assessing whether a deal can be salvaged this afternoon - their second call in 48 hours. Follow the fallout.

Fishing rights remain a thorny issue, with Downing Street confirming they are still under discussion.

Patrick O'Flynn argues the issue of fish is a red herring in the Brexit negotiations - something upon which many Telegraph readers can agree. These are the remaining sticking points.

Fears London will be plunged into Tier 3 next week

Coronavirus cases in London are continuing to rise, sparking concerns the capital will be plunged into Tier 3 next week. The seven-day rolling average of all cases across the city's boroughs is ticking up again after a period of decline in the second half of November. It has led to fears that tougher measures may be announced when the allocation of tiers is reviewed on Wednesday, December 16. The R rate in London is also above the England-wide average.

“There were more cases at the end of lockdown than at the start in London,” he said.

“It is very worrying when cases were still continuing to increase in these regions despite the national lockdown. It is quite likely that case numbers will start to accelerate even more in coming days probably including in areas not yet showing an increase because of more movement around London.

“If cases in London were rising even during a national lockdown then we do need to reconsider the Tier allocation in these areas. Whether across the region or at the Local Authority level is open to debate.”

A health source said Public Health England “is starting to get worried about it again” as the data shows cases on the rise in the capital.

The insider added that there was “concern across the system” about the number of Londoners out shopping and visiting restaurants on Saturday and Sunday, the first weekend since national lockdown measures were lifted.

Footage of densely crowded streets and crammed queues in the West End over the weekend showed hoards of shoppers ignoring, or unable to obey, social distancing measures.

In April, with Britain in the grips of its first lockdown, Fiona Paulwell-Tindle’s brother, Carlos Campbell, passed away from Covid-19, aged 47. He had been in hospital for two weeks when, one morning, the family were told he was almost ready to leave. But, by noon, the news had changed – Campbell’s condition had deteriorated, and he was given just hours to live.

“I was lost for words,” says Fionalees (who goes by her artist name), speaking seven months later at the start of England’s second lockdown. “We were told he would come out of hospital, we thought he’d be fine. I was hopeful he’d be OK when he first got it.”

Unlike many who have lost loved ones during the pandemic, Fionalees was able to say goodbye to her brother, who was at the West Middlesex University Hospital in west London. “I walked in like nothing was going to happen, I was my normal self,” she recalls. “I didn’t know another way to act. I fed him, we spoke, he smiled and laughed a lot. That was enough for me.” It wasn’t until she left the hospital that she broke down in tears.

Fionalees, Carlos and five other siblings grew up in Acton, west London, born to Jamaican parents. Music was a constant during childhood.

They invited their listeners to write in and describe their experiences to air on the show, and the result was ‘The Covid Chronicles’. Ranging from the everyday to the momentous, they described birth and death, loneliness and loss, community and kindness - as well as remarkable stories from those working on the NHS frontline.Some of those stories have been collected in a book, Letters from Lockdown, from which the following selection is taken.

‘My phone has helped patients hear their final words of love’ Lisa, nurse

My unlikely but constant companion through this Covid-19 experience has been my phone. By my side, wrapped and sealed in the cellophane bag usually used to put little vials of blood on their way from the ward to the lab for testing. It’s been my companion throughout, not offering any advice or comfort to me, just witnessing. My phone has seen and heard things it never has before, and is unlikely ever to see again, certainly not with the relentless frequency that it has done in recent weeks. In the absence of an NHS mobile or tablet on the ward, my phone has been placed next to an old lady’s ear, on her pillow as she drifts into unconsciousness, breathing with shallow, irregular gasps, with hopes and promises from her daughter, hoping that her mum will be able to hear her final words of love, even though she can’t be there to say them. Its speakerphone plays the voice of her 10-year-old granddaughter tearfully telling her that she wants her to come home to read to her again one day soon.

Its camera has FaceTimed the lovely man in Room 10 with his elderly wife and grown-up children, gathered in their living room, faces filling the small pocket-sized screen, grandchildren on more screens within screens who cannot be there with their parents because of the lockdown. Thanking him for being such a wonderful dad and granddad, telling him that they love him, and to sleep, now.

Its speakers have played favourite songs; Elvis albums and jazz compilations, songs that families have suggested will provide comfort in those last hours of life. It has been there with me and my patients, who have never seen my face, to alleviate our shared distress and distract from the sound of laboured breaths. Often abandoned without me, remaining in patients’ rooms, an offering of humanity as I am called to assess a new or deteriorating patient. My phone has been my portal to my colleagues throughout these days. Many of whom I do not know because I am new to this hospital and just a number on the rota, and whose full faces I rarely see. The hospital now on its emergency Covid-19 rota has been run by WhatsApp groups, with the old bleep system, inadequate at the best of times, now almost obsolete. Doctors communicate between teams, shifts and zones; for endocrinology advice from a senior or specialist when sodiums are low, or when delirium management needs expert advice and when food, kindly cooked by volunteers and community groups, has arrived in the doctors’ mess.

On my phone are weekly pictures of property bags of the dead, piled up in the store room waiting for collection by the porters, my own death figures captured weekly in a macabre picture. Each bag represents a person I cared for, my handwriting in their notes documenting my attempts to save them, and eventually, to keep them comfortable when alive, to be followed by my handwriting on certificates after their death. My phone’s home screen that once proudly championed the beaming smiles and silliness of my young sons’ faces is now a generic photograph, previously stored in its factory settings. The phone’s torch has proved useful for confirming deaths in the absence of pen torches on the ward. Pupils fixed and dilated. The faces of my beautiful smiling children in the forefront of my view on the phone screen, merged with the torchlight reflected in the dead man’s eyes before me in real life – pupils fixed and dilated – a visceral reminder of a separate world that I have inhabited over these weeks, associated with an intense pang of guilt that I had in that moment somehow exposed my babies to this world that I should be protecting them from.

The final role my phone has played during the coronavirus pandemic has been when I am lying in bed at night, unable to sleep or waking from vivid dreams. My phone distracts me, although as I trail mindlessly through social media, I try my best to avoid any news – I don’t want to be consumed by any bigger picture, for fear of being overwhelmed. Content and able to cope with my micro-level involvement with this pandemic, with my phone beside me that has allowed me both to stay connected and to disconnect. It’s been my lifeline and without it, I think we would have all been lost.

The film shows two versions of the same scenarios. One shows how an individual following the key health behaviours can limit the spread of the virus, whilst the other demonstrates how ignoring these behaviours leads to an increased potential to infect others.

""At some point, we'll be able to set the date when we can get rid of these restrictions and you couldn't have said that only two weeks ago.""

Others are more pessimistic. They worry about a series of potential hurdles and bear traps that could yet see lockdown extended to the summer, and perhaps beyond. They say we should brace for a third wave of the virus after Christmas and warn that vaccine supply and distribution is likely to be a slower, more painful process than many anticipate.

Like the optimists, this group also buys into the deputy chief medical officer's ""glide path to recovery"" metaphor but places greater emphasis on the short, unlit runway ahead.

They note too that the pilot, in the form of the British state, has not had a good pandemic to date, prone as it is to hubris and cock-up. Even if we do get a rerun of Roaring Twenties, that was an uneven boom that did not end well, the pessimists might add.

The British public, stoic and largely compliant with the social distancing rules since March, sensibly sit somewhere in the middle.

Research released today by King’s College London and Ipsos MORI finds that 57% do not trust the government to control the spread of coronavirus. It is the first time since the rolling-study started in April that distrust has been the majority view.

The handling of key aspects of the crisis may explain this sentiment, say the authors: nearly two-thirds (64%) think the UK government failed to prepare properly for the second wave of the virus and 47% say the government has prioritised some parts of the country over others.

So what should sensible middle Britain look out for in weeks ahead? How far away is Liberation Day and something approximating a return to life as normal?

Vaccine approval and regulation

Britain's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), was the first in the world to give the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine a temporary authorisation for emergency use this week.

It is thought likely that it will give similar approvals to the Oxford AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines before Christmas.

The move was welcomed by many but appeared to catch other regulators by surprise. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, was among several who implied the MHRA's decision had been rushed.

The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would do it the ""correct way"", he said, but later apologised and said he had ""great faith"" in the UK's regulator.",Telegraph,"['vaccine', 'hurdles', 'britain', 'wave', 'set', 'say', 'covid', 'likely', 'british', 'date', 'overcome', 'virus', 'needs', 'weeks', 'regulator']",0
2020-12-03 19:33:28+00:00,3,"At the British Nutrition Foundation’s virtual conference last week, leading scientists discussed the critical role of nutrition in the battle against Covid-19. Emerging research on Covid-19 patients, and a wealth of existing studies relating to other viral infections, suggests key nutrients such as selenium, zinc, vitamin D and probiotics may fortify the immune system, limit the severity of coronavirus symptoms and even reduce intensive care admissions and mortality rates.

Although this nutritional data requires further research, the results so far are intriguing. German research suggests patients who survived Covid-19 had higher levels of selenium – a nutrient found in turkey, sardines, eggs, Brazil nuts, liver and kidney – than those who died of the virus.

A Spanish study found that healthy levels of zinc – a mineral found in meat, poultry, cheese, shellfish and seeds – are linked to higher survival rates. Another paper found that 82.2 per cent of hospitalised coronavirus patients were deficient in vitamin D, which we gain through exposure to the sun. And an Italian study found that probiotics reduced the severity of Covid-19 symptoms and cut mortality rates.

“Nutrition is very important, not for ‘resistance’ in protecting you from getting Covid-19 but rather for improving your ‘tolerance’ of it,” explains Prof Mike Gleeson, Emeritus Professor of Exercise Biochemistry at Loughborough University and author of Eat, Move, Sleep, Repeat. “Tolerance means a decreased infection burden when you get infected, so you could get less severe symptoms and recover more quickly. That’s the possible role of nutrition. We're talking about compounds which may optimise immune response or have beneficial anti-inflammatory or antioxidant actions.”

Nothing you eat is going to stop you contracting Covid-19, warns Prof Gleeson: “This virus is so contagious it is going to get past our immunity barriers.” But a strong immune system will inevitably help you to fight it more effectively. “What we're relying on is our immune response when we do get infected. And if you're deficient in micronutrients, it may increase your risk of severe symptoms.”

The general link between a healthy diet and improved resilience to infections is nothing new, but interest in which nutrients may best support this “tolerogenic” effect is growing. Your body’s immune response to any virus requires a delicate balancing act: if your immune response is too low, your body’s defences will be overwhelmed. But if your immune response is too high, the defensive processes involved can cause excessive tissue damage and drive resources away from other vital functions, weakening your body further. Good nutrition can help to optimise this immune response.

“Essentially your immune system gets rid of viruses by seeking out your own cells which have become infected and destroying them,” explains Prof Gleeson. “So there's a real balance needed in your immune response. You want to be able to tolerate the virus, to some degree, in order to dampen your defence a little bit but still control the infection in order to reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (when the lungs cannot provide the vital organs with enough oxygen) which can develop if you get too much inflammation in the lungs.”

So how might these key nutrients help your body get it right? Research suggests selenium helps to cleverly refine your immune response. “You get less severe inflammation if you have a good selenium status,” says Prof Gleeson. “There's evidence that you get improved proliferation of your lymphocytes (white blood cells) which help to activate the cell lines that specifically respond to a virus.”

Zinc, meanwhile, helps to prevent viruses from proliferating. “Viruses have a protective coat which surrounds their genetic material and the first thing they do when they get into your cells is un-coat themselves, release their genetic material and take over your own machinery for enzymes to help generate other viruses within that cell,” explains Gleeson. “But zinc helps to inhibit that viral un-coating, as well as the enzyme which allows that genetic material to be reproduced in the cell, to help prevent a virus from proliferating.”

Probiotics may also play an important role because your gut is a key part of your immune system. “About 70 per cent of your immune cells are located in and around the gut,” explains Prof Gleeson. But your gut is also a harbouring site for Covid-19.

“The gut is a nice nutrient soup which bacteria and viruses love to feed on. Research suggests probiotics can modify that gut population of bacteria to give it a healthier profile. Probiotics can also modify immune cells in the gut which can then migrate to other areas, including the lungs – and this may be where you get some protection.”

The link between vitamin D and Covid-19 is not yet confirmed but the vitamin plays a key role in general immunity. “We know from studies on the common cold that with low vitamin D you're more likely to pick up viral infections,” says Gleeson. “Although 10ug is the recommended dose, if you’ve not had sun for months that’s not enough to get you up to the levels you want for optimal immune function, so we suggest at least 1000IU, or 25ug.”

So Vitamin D supplements may be necessary over winter but Prof Gleeson insists we can get most of the other immunity-optimising nutrients from our everyday diet. As well as the foods listed above, nuts, cod and wholegrains also contain selenium (RDA 75μg for men, 60ug for women); beef, dairy and spinach also provide zinc (RDA 9.5mg for men, 7mg for women); and a healthy mix of fruit and veg will contribute to your healthy gut bacteria, which can be topped up with probiotics.

But if this nutritional evidence is not compelling enough, it seems that improving your diet may even help you ahead of the imminent roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines. “We know that with vaccines like the one for the influenza virus, selenium and vitamin D are linked to stronger antibody responses to the vaccination,” explains Prof Gleeson. “So it makes sense to boost up, ready for when we all get the chance to have this vaccine.”",Telegraph,"['prof', 'selenium', 'anticovid', 'diet', 'vitamin', 'response', 'boost', 'help', 'immune', 'covid19', 'zinc', 'gleeson', 'probiotics', 'gut', 'd']",0
2020-12-02 21:38:33+00:00,3,"Residents of care homes shared their first precious hugs and kisses with relatives since March on Wednesday, after homes were able to give visitors rapid tests for Covid-19 which give results in 30 minutes.

Bob Underhill, an 84-year-old retiree, was reunited with his wife Patricia, 82, who has Alzheimer's after he tested negative for coronavirus.

Both were overcome as they met, then hugged and kissed through their face masks.

Mrs Underhill moved into a home in London in March after breaking her hip, meaning her husband could no longer care for her.

Mr Underhill revealed that he had only seen his wife twice since then, and that being able to meet in person made all the difference compared to his last visit.

Covid-19 spread rapidly through care homes at the start of the pandemic, as institutions found themselves without adequate protective gear, and agency staff working in multiple homes and visitors unwittingly spread the virus.

This led to homes coming under strict lockdown and limiting visits to protect frail and elderly residents.

Serena Snelling took a test before seeing her mother, Theresa, who has been in a home since late February.

Ms Snelling said that the separation had been a real challenge and that she couldn't wait to hug her mother again after being told by care home staff that she had tested negative for coronavirus.

2020-12-02 19:05:44+00:00,4,"“I had to drive him to A&E with the girls,” says Amina. “Everyone was screaming: ‘Why are you here with the girls?’ They took him in and the following morning I called and they said he had Covid. I was really crying. Later I got a call from him again saying: ‘They’re telling me they might ventilate me.’ So I went on the internet [to learn more] and thought: ‘This is not good’.”

Sama, too, was frightened. “It was the scariest moment of my life because I’d read about ventilators,” says the former footballer, who was on medication for angina before he caught coronavirus. He was the first person in the UK to sign up for the trial of the antiviral medication Remdesivir to treat severe coronavirus. But in his case, doctors feared the worst.

He was put into an induced coma and a week later Amina received a call from the hospital. “They said nothing was working on Sama. There was nothing much they could do any more,” she says. “They were about to switch off [his machine]. I was just pleading, begging them to give him another chance.”

He remained in a coma for two months, and Amina was warned her husband of 12 years was unlikely to pull through.

“It was really difficult,” she says. “All we had in our house was crying and praying. We didn’t know if Sama was coming back or not. I’d talk to nurses and all they would say was: ‘He’s very, very sick’.”

Sometimes when she called the hospital, a nurse would place the phone beside Sama’s ear in case he could hear his wife and daughters’ voices through his coma. There were times when it seemed like he could, according to the staff who sat beside him.

Although flooded with relief when he did finally wake up, Amina was distressed to discover the state he was in. “They had to call me in because he was really confused,” she recalls. “Sama is a bubbly person but he couldn’t even understand what was going on around him. It was a shock because he looked completely different from the person I used to know.”

Sama was discharged in early June, about three weeks after waking up. At first he was in a wheelchair, but over the past few months he’s been learning to walk again, aided by physiotherapy. He still feels tired much of the time, and grows breathless after walking any more than 200 metres. He also suffers joint pain in his shoulders and knees.

Were he in any doubt about how narrow an escape he made from a virus that has claimed the lives of so many, it would have been dispelled by the reaction of one of his doctors when he attended an appointment post-discharge.

“I’m a healthcare professional and I know healthcare professionals don’t show emotion because it’s bad for the patients, but he was in tears,” says Sama. “He said: ‘I can’t believe I’m seeing you. Whatever God you’re serving, keep serving that God, because to be honest, it’s not our medication [that saved you]. We’ve done our best but it’s a miracle you came back because we were going to switch that machine off.’”

Instead Sama is back with his wife and daughters again, something he describes as “a joy.”

“I’m happy,” he says. “Coming back makes me appreciate everything.”

The Prime Minister’s measures passed the Commons by 291 votes to 78 after Labour decided to abstain but not without a bruising backlash from Tory MPs.

2022-03-30 10:35:32+00:00,1,"Free parking for NHS staff working in hospitals in England will end on Friday, the Health Secretary has said.

Parking fees were waived during the Covid-19 pandemic, but Sajid Javid said that the benefit would end on Friday.

In an update on Covid-19, Mr Javid wrote: ""Free parking in hospital car parks for NHS staff introduced during the pandemic will also come to an end on 31 March.

""However, over 93 per cent of NHS trusts that charge for car parking have implemented free parking for those in greatest need, including NHS staff working overnight.""

He added: ""On behalf of the Government, I would like to record my thanks to everyone who has worked tirelessly to keep people safe over the last two years and whose efforts have enabled us to move to the next stage of the Covid-19 response.""

""After the years of Tory cuts NHS trusts are struggling, we know.

""But scrabbling the money back off hard up workers is not the answer.

""The Government must now legislate for free hospital staff parking once and for all.""

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told PA: ""Our amazing NHS key workers put their lives on the line to get us through this pandemic.

""Scrapping free car parking in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis is a lousy way to repay that service.

""The Government should be giving health staff a proper pay rise - not adding to their bills.

""And it should be funding our NHS properly so that hospitals don't have to rely on car parks for income.""

The Department of Health and Social Care said that the perk was ""temporary"" and introduced in July 2020 ""for the duration of the pandemic"".

It said that the scheme had cost around £130 million over the past two years.

Unison's head of health Sara Gorton added: ""This is no way for the NHS to hang on to staff in the current job market.

""Parking charges will add hundreds of pounds to the massive cost pressures already facing health staff and reduce their morale even further.

""Those already on the brink of leaving the NHS may well see this as the final straw and head for the exit, just as the service needs experienced staff the most.

2022-03-26 06:32:48+00:00,6,"Experts have warned that hospitals should routinely test patients with Covid-19 for influenza, as new data suggests a coinfection more than doubles the risk of death.

In a major study of roughly 305,000 people hospitalised with Sars-Cov-2, scientists found that those who had both coronavirus and flu were four times more likely to require ventilation support than if they only had Covid - and 2.4 times more likely to die.

Numbers of coinfections were low, partly because coronavirus restrictions suppressed the circulation of a range of other viruses, too. The researchers identified 227 patients who had Covid and flu between February 2020 and December 2021 - but their outcomes were generally worse than those infected with Sars-Cov-2 and other viruses, including an adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Researchers involved in the study, published in the Lancet on Friday, told journalists that the findings have significant ramifications for the UK’s public health strategy, calling for a renewed emphasis on vaccinations and influenza testing in hospitals.

“We are seeing a rise in the usual seasonal respiratory viruses as people return to normal mixing, so we can expect flu to be circulating alongside Covid-19 this winter,” said Professor Calum Semple, a professor of Child Health and Outbreak Medicine at the University of Liverpool, and member of the government’s SAGE advisory group.

“We were surprised that the risk of death more than doubled when people were infected by both flu and Covid-19 viruses. It is now very important that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses, and not leave it until it is too late.”

The inquiry will look at the UK’s preparedness and response to the pandemic and recommend lessons to learn for the future.

But Marsha de Cordova, Labour MP for Battersea, has called it “shocking” and “disgraceful” that the inquiry’s terms of reference make no mention of disabled people.

The terms of reference, published earlier this month, have been criticised after failing to mention the words “child” or “children”, and making no reference to mental health.

Ms de Cordova, who is registered blind, told The Telegraph: “It is shocking that the terms of reference of this long-awaited public inquiry does not mention disabled people, given the devastating and disproportionate impact of the pandemic, where six in 10 people who died were ill or disabled.

‘The struggles of millions ignored’

“I am especially surprised at this omission as the Cabinet Office minister assured me in February that the inquiry would have a specific focus on the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on ill and disabled people. Yet again, they have ignored the struggles of millions.”

Speaking in the House of Commons last month, Ms de Cordova asked Heather Wheeler, Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, if the inquiry would have a “specific focus” on disabled people.

“I believe the answer is yes,” Ms Wheeler responded.

Ms de Cordova added that the omission of disabled people, race or inequality from the inquiry’s aims was “disgraceful”.

“How are people meant to have any faith in this inquiry?” she said.

A Cabinet Office spokesperson stressed the terms of reference of the inquiry do commit to considering the impact of the pandemic on persons protected under the Equality Act 2010, which includes those with disabilities.

Six out of 10 people who died of Covid by the end of 2020 were disabled, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.

And in neighbouring Hong Kong, a “plane crash in slow motion” is unfolding, with apocalyptic scenes of the sick sharing hospital wards with the dead emerging as mortuaries are overwhelmed. It’s a dramatic shift for a city that had, until late last year, largely kept daily Covid-19 figures in the single-digits.

Welcoming the change in guidance, Helen Wildbore, the director of the Relatives and Residents Association, said: ""It's a step in the right direction, and it's good to see they are recognising the really vital role that family carers play.""

The association will meet MPs including Jeremy Hunt, a former Health Secretary, on Wednesday to call for patients to be given the legal right to have in-person support from at least one essential ""care supporter"".

Ms Wildbore said: ""What we need is a change in the law to make sure that families and people who use services aren't scrambling around in different bits of guidance to work out what rules apply in different settings. It should be a legal right that moves with them.""

The new rules also state that A&E and outpatient settings must accommodate visitors ""where the patient may wish/need to be accompanied by somebody important to them"".

""No patient should have to attend on their own unless it is their personal choice,"" they add.

Boris Johnson announced the end of all remaining virus regulations, including the legal obligation to self-isolation, under the ""living with Covid"" plan.

Free lateral flow tests will also no longer be available from April 1. In a change to the previous NHS guidance, published in January, hospital visitors are no longer advised to take a lateral flow test before visiting a loved one in hospital.

2022-03-07 19:04:08+00:00,34,"A Covid infection may shrink the brain, with degeneration happening three times faster than normal for middle-aged people, a new study suggests.

The University of Oxford selected 401 people who caught the virus while taking part in the UK Biobank study and compared their brain scans before and after the infection.

They discovered that in olfactory-related regions – which govern smell – brain volume had decreased by an average of 0.7 per cent compared to a matched control group who were not infected.

Typically, a middle-aged person loses just 0.2 per cent volume in that region in a year, while someone in older age could expect to lose 0.3 per cent annually. It suggests the decline happened more quickly in people who caught Covid.

The researchers also found that people who had tested positive took longer to complete a battery of cognitive tests.

Writing in the journal Nature, the authors concluded: “Our longitudinal analyses revealed a significant, deleterious impact associated with Covid-19.

“Significantly greater cognitive decline, which persisted even after excluding the hospitalised patients, was seen in the Covid-19 positive group between the two timepoints.

“Whether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.”

Findings may explain some long Covid symptoms

To check that the declines in brain volume and performance were not simply the after-effects of a respiratory infection, the team also carried out analysis on the brains of people who developed pneumonia, unrelated to Covid. They found no similar changes.

Scientists say they do not know whether the brain loss is linked to the virus itself, the immune response or whether the loss of stimulation from having no sense of smell may be behind the damage. Because the study is observational, they cannot prove a causal effect.

However, experts said it may explain some of the symptoms of long Covid experienced by people after an infection.",Telegraph,"['normal', 'covid', 'times', 'faster', 'degenerate', 'smell', 'brain', 'long', 'virus', 'positive', 'cent', 'cause', 'volume', 'infection', 'study']",0
2022-03-05 13:31:23+00:00,6,"Alzheimer's patient deaths increased by more than a quarter in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, a major study has found, as researchers suggest remote appointments were to blame.

Records of more than 27 million patients were analysed to see if there was a link between coronavirus rates and excess deaths among patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and other related dementias.

Alzheimer’s patients were at “higher risk of dying” in 2020 compared to 2019, “either directly of Covid-19 or because of premature death owing to disruptions in health care”, the authors found.

It comes after patients struggled to see their GP in person during the pandemic and many did not come forward for care amid concerns of overwhelming the health system.

The researchers, from the Harvard Kennedy School, Boston and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, New Hampshire, used data from people who benefited from Medicare - a US government health insurance programme - between January 2019 and December 2020.

Participants were aged 65 or older and were grouped into four categories, with or without Alzheimer’s and with or without Alzheimer’s and living in a care home.

Mortality rates from March to December 2020 were compared to those in the same period in 2019.

Deaths among patients without Alzheimer’s, when adjusted for other factors, were 12 per cent higher in 2020 compared to the previous year.

But for patients with the disease the increase was 26 per cent. The excess mortality was even more marked among Asian, Black and Hispanic populations with Alzheimer’s, the authors found.

Excess deaths for those living in care homes with the disease were also up 14 per cent on the previous year.

Discussing the potential explanations, the authors highlighted the changes in access to healthcare during the pandemic, “including fewer inpatient admissions and the transition of outpatient visits to telehealth platforms, may disproportionately affect older adults with [Alzheimer’s]”.

“Because older adults in general and older adults with cognitive impairments are less able to engage effectively with standard telehealth platforms, it is not difficult to imagine how the combination of less effective (or absent) outpatient care and lower inpatient admission rates led to higher mortality,” they said.",Telegraph,"['quarter', 'health', 'pandemic', 'covid', 'higher', 'care', 'deaths', 'rates', 'increased', 'alzheimers', 'patients', 'disease', 'older']",0

""The fact that the commission concluded that the overall strategy, based on non-invasive recommendations... was the right choice. I think that's good.""

The commission is, however, much more critical of the speed of Sweden’s covid response, finding that measures were ""too few and should have come sooner”.

While the report’s authors said Sweden's government was right to not shut primary and lower secondary schools during the pandemic, they wrote that other “indoor settings where people gather or come into close contact” should have been restricted.

These include shopping centres, restaurants, cultural and sports events, hairdressing salons, and swimming pools.

The commission also argues that face masks should have been encouraged in public places as soon as they were no longer in short supply, that the government should have stopped all inessential inward travel in March 2020, and that those returning from ski trips at the end of February should have been asked to quarantine.

The report is also critical of the way the government delegated responsibility to the Public Health Agency, its then director-general Johan Carlson, and state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

“The Government should have assumed leadership of all aspects of crisis management from the outset,” it rules. “It should have been able to overcome the obstacles to clear national leadership that currently exist.”

Tobias Billström, group leader of the opposition Moderate Party, said that this amounted to scathing criticism.

""The commission is saying that the government has not done what a government should do in this situation, which is to lead the nation. They've dodged out of it,"" he said.

The report also accuses the government of being over-reliant on the Public Health Agency for expertise.

Ms Hallengren rejected this charge: “They can have their opinion about that. But the fact is, that the Public Health Agency is not one expert, it’s hundreds of experts.

Of these, 4,436 pregnant women were admitted to hospital with Covid during this period in the UK, of whom two thirds, 65 per cent, had mild illness, 21 per cent had moderate illness, and 14 per cent had severe infection, the Oxford study found.

More than three quarters, 77 per cent, of all the women were in their third trimester of pregnancy.

During the study period, 22 women died with severe Covid-19 during pregnancy, 59 babies were stillborn and 10 babies died in the neonatal period.

Women at greatest risk were aged over 30, from black, Asian or other ethnic minority backgrounds, were obese or had other health conditions such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure, the research found.

The study also revealed that 82 per cent of women from the most deprived areas of the country were unvaccinated at the time of birth, compared with 52 per cent of those in the least deprived areas.

‘Pandemic created fear and worry among women’

Prof Marian Knight, a University of Oxford maternal health expert who led the study, said: “While vaccination rates are increasing, it is extremely concerning that pregnant women who are at most risk of severe infection are among the communities least likely to be vaccinated before giving birth.

“Local community engagement with vulnerable groups of women should be an urgent priority to address concerns and give reassurance about the Covid-19 vaccine.”

Prof Dame Lesley Regan, the chairman of Wellbeing of Women, said: “It is understandable that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created fear, worry and uncertainty for women thinking about having a baby and those who are already pregnant.

“Unfortunately, Covid-19 has also worsened existing health and social inequalities, particularly among pregnant women from ethnic groups.

“The initial advice for pregnant women last year did not recommend the Covid-19 vaccine, which has undoubtedly contributed to low vaccination rates. It also highlights the need for pregnant women to be included in clinical trials at a much earlier stage.”

The Queen, who is 95, will still be reading her papers as part of her daily duties, but she was not feeling quite up to taking part in planned video calls, which generally require her in-depth knowledge of global affairs across countless different sectors.

There remains a significant debate about how best to tackle the imbalance – while some argue that waiving patents would boost production, others say this would do little to get more shots in arms and instead advocate for technology transfer agreements.



The news comes after Afrigen, a South African company that is part of WHO’s mRNA hub, announced it had developed its own version of an mRNA shot, based on the publicly available data of the Moderna Covd-19 vaccine earlier this month.



During the pandemic, more than 70 per cent of mRNA shots from Moderna and Pfizer in the US and BioNTech in Germany have been delivered to wealthy nations, and the pharmaceutical giants have been under mounting pressure to do more to boost availability in lower income countries.



Earlier this week, BioNTech announced that it had developed a vaccine factory made from shipping containers which it plans to ship to several African countries to boost regional production.

It comes after the company struck a deal with Rwanda and Senegal to begin construction of an mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Africa come summer.



Meanwhile Moderna said it would invest roughly $500 million to build a facility in Africa to produce half a billion doses of mRNA vaccines each year, although details of exactly what this will entail remain hazy.

The NHS is set to offer jabs to all children aged five to 11 from April, following a recommendation from independent scientific advisors.

But parents will be told that children should not normally be vaccinated within three months of a Covid infection.

On Thursday, Sage scientists said it would become increasingly difficult for parents to establish whether their child had suffered a recent Covid infection if access to free tests is removed.

Professor Calum Semple, professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said that the majority of children would suffer no harm from having a vaccine relatively soon after infection - but said the situation left parents facing difficult dilemmas.

'Most symptomatic cases are mild'

“If a child had severe disease, in particular if they had been in hospital you’d want time for things to settle down, you’d want to give it the 12 weeks,” he told The Telegraph.

“Most symptomatic cases are mild - which means there is less for parents to worry about, but it’s going to be harder to know if there isn’t testing,” the scientist said.

“It doesn’t matter too much medically,” he said.

“Ideally it’s best to wait 12 weeks but for the majority of children who have had a mild case it won’t matter - but it is very difficult for parents.”

In advice to the Government last week, Sage scientists said removing access to free testing could “disproportionately impact” vulnerable people and make it harder for people to take precautionary actions and increase anxiety among clinically vulnerable groups.

'Signal' for people to ignore Covid symptoms

The scientists also said the removal of free and accessible testing may be “taken as a signal” that people should continue to attend workplaces or social gatherings while showing Covid-19 symptoms.

The Government is expected to outline plans to abolish some of the current testing structure in its Living Safely With Covid strategy, due to be published next week.

Prof Adam Finn, JCVI member and professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: “The reason that the JCVI agreed a 12-week gap between doses - and had a 12-week gap between infection and first dose for older children - was because of emerging evidence suggesting that a longer gap protects against the risk of myocarditis (a rare type of heart inflammation).”

'Reducing a small theoretical risk as much as possible'

“It is about reducing a small theoretical risk as much as possible, and it was very cautious, but that was the reason for setting the gap at 12 weeks,” he said.

“It sounds like the Treasury is trying to cut spending on tests, so really it depends how far that goes.”

“Without routine testing there will be a lot more undiagnosed infection. Obviously if there is another wave the risks of an infection are higher, and I would think the Government might want to reassess any decision to dismantle testing.”

When the JCVI deliberated on rolling out vaccines to children aged 12 to 15, one of their greatest concerns was about whether jabs increased the risk of myocarditis, with particular concerns about second doses.

As a result, when vaccines were first offered to this age group, they were only offered one jab.

The precaution was taken because of evidence from other countries linking most cases of myocarditis to second jabs. However, most nations have shorter intervals between doses.

In November, the JCVI said the rollout of jabs to adults suggests that with a longer interval, of up to 12 weeks, there is almost no risk of the condition.",Telegraph,"['gap', 'children', 'jabs', 'free', '12', 'removed', 'jcvi', 'confusion', 'risk', 'weeks', 'covid', 'tests', 'jab', 'parents', 'testing', 'infection']",0
2022-02-16 16:21:26+00:00,2,"Covid vaccines will be offered to six million children aged five to 11 in England, Scotland and Wales, following advice from scientists.

Here are the answers to some of the key questions about vaccines for younger children.

What is the latest?

The independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the Government, has recommended that a “non-urgent” offer of vaccines should be made to all children aged between five and 11.

The advice was given to ministers more than a week ago, with Wales and Scotland first to act, ahead of an announcement by the JCVI on Wednesday, supporting rollout across the UK.

What is the point of this decision?

Many scientists say the approval has come too late to assist in efforts to protect children against the current wave of omicron, which appears to be on its way out.

Latest estimates suggest 85 per cent of children aged between five and 11 have had Covid, giving them some immunity.

But the JCVI say the jabs could help to increase protection against potential future waves. Its scientists say this could “protect the very small number of children” who develop severe disease from serious illness and hospitalisation and provide some short-term protection against mild infection across the age group.

When can children aged five to 11 get their first jab?

The programme will start being rolled out in April, with two jabs 12 weeks apart, meaning second jabs should start being delivered in July.

How does that protect children from future waves?

While prevention of mild infection is short-lived, jabs offer longer-term protection against serious disease. With a minimum 12-week gap required between doses, health officials say it is too late to start the rollout when any future wave has started spreading.

Why would we bother, when omicron has proved extremely mild for children?

Scientists have stressed that we do not know what future waves will bring, and what impact future variants could have.

So why isn’t it a priority?

The JCVI doesn’t just look at Covid jabs.

The Scottish Tories said it was time for the First Minister to trust Scots to take personal responsibility for how they manage the risks of the virus and claimed the data cast doubts over the effectiveness of her strategy of “bringing in restrictions on a whim”.

The Financial Times found that despite the SNP maintaining a legal requirement to wear face coverings in public places last summer and introducing vaccine passports, this did not stop death rates rising above England, where the measures were not in place.

England is to end all its Covid regulations on Feb 24 while Wales has indicated that its rules are likely to be replaced by guidance next month. Northern Ireland lifted its Covid laws on Tuesday.

Ms Sturgeon is to set out her plan for “living with Covid” next week but has previously indicated that mask laws at least will remain for the foreseeable future.

Restrictions on people's lives

“This new analysis casts fresh doubt on Nicola Sturgeon’s approach to imposing restrictions on people’s lives across Scotland,” Sandesh Gulhane, health spokesman for the Scottish Tories, said.

“The public will be asking serious questions as to why some of these needed to happen, when death rates have continued to be higher at some points in Scotland.”

Dr Gulhane added: “Next week we must see Nicola Sturgeon set out a different approach for tackling Covid and putting personal responsibility at the heart of it.

“The public can be trusted to make their own choices rather than ministers bringing in restrictions on a whim.”

In December, Ms Sturgeon warned of an impending “tsunami” of omicron cases and closed nightclubs, imposed curbs on hospitality venues and banned large crowds for three weeks after Christmas.

She admitted that she wanted to go further and demanded that the UK Government resurrect the furlough scheme so she could shut down sections of the economy, although this was rejected.

Boris Johnson reimposed facemask requirements in England but stopped short of more restrictive measures.

Official data found that where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, fatalities per capita actually hit higher levels in Scotland than England in January.

Other analysis has also found Scotland has recorded higher deaths than England in recent months.

Figures published late January found that England has seen consistently lower death rates than the other devolved nations since its Freedom Day on July 19, despite imposing fewer restrictions.

Deaths involving Covid were just over 30 per 100,000 in England in late January compared with nearly 45 per 100,000 in Scotland and Wales and more than 55 per 100,000 in Northern Ireland.

Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said that when Scotland and England were “plugged into international comparisons” the “main thing we see is they’re so similar”.

Overall, since the start of the pandemic in early 2020 to Jan 28 2022, there were 2,668 deaths per million people in England where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate compared with 2,315 in Scotland.

People are far more spread out

Although overall death rates per capita are slightly lower in Scotland than in England since the start of the pandemic, this is likely to be at least in part because in Scotland people are far more spread out.

There are 432 people per square kilometre in England, compared to 70 in Scotland, which has Glasgow and its surrounding areas as its only major metropolis.

Other experts have said that Scotland’s older population, and having less cases during previous waves, could also explain death numbers rising about England’s recently.

Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: “Every death during this pandemic is a tragedy and our thoughts and condolences are with all those who have lost a loved one. Overall, since the start of the pandemic, Scotland has had fewer Covid-19 deaths per head of population compared to England and Wales, and our infection levels continue to remain below those in England.

“While the vaccination programme and people’s dedication has meant that the situation is improving, the pandemic is not over. The First Minister has made clear that later this month the Scottish Government will publish an updated Strategic Framework, that will set out in greater detail our approach to managing Covid more sustainably in the coming phases of the pandemic.”",Telegraph,"['rules', 'england', 'scotlands', 'scottish', 'sturgeons', 'englands', 'death', 'strict', 'pandemic', 'restrictions', 'nicola', 'covid', 'compared', 'deaths', 'rates', 'scotland', 'sturgeon']",0
2022-02-15 23:39:42+00:00,6,"Wales has become the first country in the UK to announce it will be offering the Covid-19 vaccine to all five to 11-year-olds.

Last week the Telegraph revealed that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had drawn up advice recommending that jabs should be offered on a “non-urgent” basis to all children aged five to 11.

This would mean parents could choose for their children to have two jabs, 12 weeks apart, in coming months.

But the Westminster Government has yet to issue advice, saying only that it is reviewing it as part of “wider decision making” ahead of the publication of a long-term strategy for living with Covid-19, which is due next week.

On Tuesday Eluned Morgan, Wales’ health minister, said she had read the “yet to be published” report by the JCVI and would be further rolling out the jab.

Hold-up in publishing

Responding to questions during a plenary session at the Senedd on Tuesday, Baroness Morgan said the hold-up in publishing the advice was “a shame” and “perplexing”.

She said: “I have seen a copy of that advice and we will be commencing the rollout of vaccinations for five to 11-year-olds.”

The minister has not set out a timetable for when youngsters will be able to get the jab. She told Senedd members: “We’re not going to do that as a matter of urgency, as we did over the Christmas period. That’s partly because the risk isn’t as great to that cohort.

“And we’re also waiting to hear from the JCVI to see whether they’ll need a booster on top of the booster for older age groups in the spring.”

The delays have fuelled speculation that the Government is reluctant to see the mass rollout of jabs for children.

But one Whitehall source suggested that ministers were keen to frame the option in the context of longer-term strategies for living with Covid, which would see more emphasis on personal responsibility, and less on government diktat.

The JCVI advice is understood to describe vaccines for children as a “non-urgent offer” rather than a recommendation, after months of debate between the committee about whether to back the rollout.

Lower dose for children

The UK medical regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, approved the Pfizer vaccine for use in children aged five to 11 last year. The dose is lower than that used for adults and older children.

After the announcement, the JCVI said that the vaccine should be offered to at-risk children aged five to 11, but it has yet to announce a wider rollout to this group.

Baroness Morgan said: “Of course it’s likely to have been a very difficult decision for the JCVI because generally children have a milder illness and fewer hospitalisations. But, of course, they have to balance that against the prospect of missing school.”

A government spokesman in Westminster said: “We are reviewing the JCVI’s advice as part of wider decision-making ahead of the publication of our long-term strategy for living with Covid-19. More detail will be set out shortly.”",Telegraph,"['wales', 'vaccine', 'rollout', 'children', 'jabs', 'uk', 'jcvi', 'aged', 'offer', 'covid19', 'morgan', '11', 'wider', 'country', 'advice', 'living']",0

Employment lawyers warned the scrapping of the law on self-isolation raised the risks in the workplace.

“If the risk goes up, the steps that an employer takes may increase in order to ensure it is complying with health and safety obligations. That could include enhanced social distancing and mask wearing.”

Caspar Glyn QC, a leading employment barrister and a spokesman for the Employment Lawyers Association, said: “The employer still has a duty of care under the criminal and civil law to provide a place of work as safe as reasonably practicable.

“So an employer would be wise to continue not to allow those infected with Covid to come to work where they may infect others.”

Ben Willmott, the head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: “The onus will shift to employers on how to best manage the risk of Covid in the workplace. Employers will need to ensure they maintain their fundamental duty of care to their staff to protect their physical and mental wellbeing.”

Paul Hunter, the Professor in Medicine at the University in East Anglia, told BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: “I would lean against offering it to this age group for a number of reasons.”

“Although we’ve seen very high infection rates in children in recent weeks, they are actually falling really quickly at the moment and we’re seeing fewer than half the cases in this age group than we saw in little more than a week ago so in many ways we are past the point where vaccines are going to make much difference.”

Last September, Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, estimated that half of all children had been infected with coronavirus, a number that is now far higher after the recent omicron wave.

Prof Hunter said that it was now likely that many children have “probably had multiple Covids by now and so working out the risks” is not easy to do.

Experts from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) are expected to give their decision on vaccinating healthy, young children in the UK this week, according to the BBC.

Across Europe and the US, 5-11-year-olds have been able to get vaccinated for some time, though that is not the case currently in Britain.

Prof Hunter said the primary reason to offer the vaccine to children was to prevent disruption to their schooling, but the evidence from vaccinating older children showed that the benefits were “marginal”.

“The only reason why they were given it was to hopefully protect them against disruption to schooling and we haven’t seen that vaccines have done a huge amount to stop those interruptions,” he said.

Prof Hunter said that it was now likely that many children have “probably had multiple Covids by now and so working out the risks” is not easy to do.

Experts from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) are expected to give their decision on vaccinating healthy, young children in the UK this week, according to the BBC.

Across Europe and the US, 5-11-year-olds have been able to get vaccinated for some time, though that is not the case currently in Britain.

Prof Hunter said the primary reason to offer the vaccine to children was to prevent disruption to their schooling, but the evidence from vaccinating older children showed that the benefits were “marginal”.

“The only reason why they were given it was to hopefully protect them against disruption to schooling and we haven’t seen that vaccines have done a huge amount to stop those interruptions,” he said.

For younger children “it's probably too late as most kids have already had omicron,” he added.",Telegraph,"['point', 'week', 'jabs', 'children', 'hunter', 'expert', 'uk', 'recent', 'reason', 'seen', 'covid', 'vaccinating', 'difference', 'past', 'vaccines', 'schooling']",0
2022-02-09 12:15:38+00:00,3,"A health minister has apologised for an “error of judgment” in continuing a meeting despite being informed part of the way through that she had tested positive for Covid.

Gillian Keegan had been in discussion with three fathers whose daughters took their own lives when an aide came into the room and told her a lateral flow test had come back positive.

Under the Government’s guidelines, Ms Keegan, the minister for care and mental health, should have immediately excused herself and gone into isolation. Instead, she asked the men whether they were happy to carry on the meeting – which they were.

Admitting her mistake on Twitter, she posted: “Earlier today, ahead of a planned visit I took a precautionary LFD test which gave a positive result. I am now isolating at home and fortunately feel fine.

“When I was told my test was positive I was listening to three fathers who had tragically lost their daughters to suicide. I told them the result and took further precautions but, with their consent, I stayed for a short period to hear their stories.

“I should have immediately ended the meeting, and on reflection this was an error of judgment on my part. I fully recognise the importance of following the letter and spirit of the policies, so want to be upfront about what happened and to apologise for the mistake I made.”

‘We were happy to keep talking’

The fathers – Mike Palmer, Tim Owen and Andy Airey – said they were “absolutely fine with it” and “wanted the meeting to go on”. The trio, known collectively as 3 Dads Walking, have raised more than £800,000 for the suicide prevention charity Papyrus and are campaigning for suicide awareness and prevention to be introduced on the curriculum.

Mr Palmer, 56, from Manchester, said Ms Keegan “was acting very responsibly”. He added: “As soon as she found out a little way through the meeting, she moved away towards the door. We were socially distanced and the meeting carried on, but she was at the door waiting to go. We were absolutely fine with it. We were happy to keep talking.”

Mr Owen, from Norfolk, said: “She stayed massively well distanced and separated from us and then we agreed to meet in the future. We were more than two metres away from her at all times in the meeting, so we are massively relaxed about it.”

A spokesman for Papyrus, whose chief executive and chairman were also at the meeting, said: “She was very honest with the group and explained what had happened and the meeting wrapped up fairly soon after that.”

The NHS website encourages people to take rapid lateral flow tests on days when they are more likely to catch or spread the virus – for example when mixing with people in crowded indoor places. In the event of a positive test result, the website says that “you must self-isolate immediately”

‘Morally irresponsible behaviour’

Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, accepted Ms Keegan's apology and “continues to support her in her role”, his spokesman said.

However, Lobby Akinnola, a spokesman for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “This is completely morally irresponsible behaviour.

“As the families of the over 175,000 people who have lost loved ones to Covid-19 know all too well, Keegan's actions could have led to someone's death. It's deeply disturbing that this came from one of the country's health ministers.”

One Tory MP indicated that the incident had raised eyebrows, saying: “I’m a bit perplexed. I don’t quite understand what happened – why would you take a lateral flow test, presumably seconds before having a meeting with someone, then presumably give the little white plastic thing to someone else to look at?”",Telegraph,"['ms', 'suicide', 'health', 'test', 'gillian', 'covid', 'told', 'result', 'positive', 'apologises', 'took', 'ending', 'spokesman', 'meeting', 'keegan', 'minister']",0

The UK’s second antiviral pill, PF-07321332+ritonavir, also known as Paxlovid, will be made available to thousands of people from February 10.

Clinical studies have suggested the drug, which is made by Pfizer, can cut the risk of hospital admission or death by 88 per cent if given in the first five days of symptoms.

The drug was approved by the medicines regulator last month for adults who could be vulnerable to coronavirus due to age, weight or prior chronic illness.

One other antiviral, molnupiravir, and sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody, are already being given to high-risk patients, with nearly 10,000 people treated to date.

'An important milestone' in Covid fight

People in the highest risk groups have already been informed by the NHS if they have a condition that will make them eligible to receive the treatments.

Eligible patients who receive a positive test will be assessed by a doctor from an NHS Covid Medicines Delivery Unit over the phone, who will discuss the most appropriate treatment for them.

Those who are prescribed Paxlovid will be able to get someone to collect it from one of the units or have it delivered to their home.

2022-01-26 22:17:30+00:00,11,"SNP ministers have been accused of a “shameless power grab” after unveiling legislation to make permanent their emergency Covid-19 powers they used to impose lockdown restrictions in Scotland.

The Coronavirus (Recovery and Reform) Bill gives ministers wide-ranging powers to respond to public health measures, similar to the temporary ones they have used during the pandemic, which were due to expire shortly.

Among the host of powers the legislation will give Scottish ministers on a permanent basis are the ability to shut schools and to make laws “directly or indirectly imposing restrictions or requirements” on people or any premises.

John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, said the Bill would also temporarily extend “pragmatic reforms” to the justice system to help clear a huge backlog of cases. These include allowing some procedural hearings to be held over audio or video link.

Temporary laws introduced during the pandemic making it harder for private landlords to evict their tenants and allowing prisoners to be released earlier are also to be made permanent.

Overwhelming opposition to the Bill

But a public consultation on the plans published alongside the Bill showed overwhelming opposition to it, with respondents complaining of an “undemocratic overreach of government power which many felt breached human rights”.

An official analysis of the responses to the consultation said: “Phrases such as ‘power grab’, ‘over-reach’ and ‘abuse of power’ were widely used, and the Scottish Government was described as authoritarian or dictatorial in its control of the population.”

Respondents also complained that the Scottish Government was only given the powers temporarily to “deal with the challenges created by the pandemic”, with the report citing widespread demands for Scotland to be allowed to “return to normal”.

“Many doubted the effectiveness of these measures in controlling Covid”, the analysis said, with responses highlighting the “apparent contradictions” in Nicola Sturgeon’s rules. These included wearing masks in shops but not “standing and drinking in a bar”.

The Bill was introduced despite the First Minister shortly unveiling a new long-term strategy for living with Covid-19 that relies far less on lockdown-style restrictions. She has admitted they are less effective at tackling the omicron variant thanks to its increased transmissibility.

‘Emergency powers – not a free pass’

The powers were given to SNP ministers on a temporary basis in 2020 after MSPs passed two emergency coronavirus Acts, both in single-day sittings.

MSPs later agreed a six-month extension of the powers until March this year with the potential for a further extension until September.

The Scottish Government said the Bill would bring “Scotland into line with England and Wales where these powers are already permanent”.

But Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s Covid Recovery spokeswoman, said: “This is a shameless power grab from the SNP.

“These emergency powers were a necessary response to an unprecedented crisis – not a free pass for Ministers to hoard new powers.

“This Bill would give Ministers permanent powers to shut down schools and confine people to their homes at the drop of a hat.”

Referring to the widespread opposition in the consultation responses, she added: “The SNP must listen to the public and stop this gross overreach.”

Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tories’ Shadow Covid Recovery Secretary, said: “Whilst there may be measures in this Bill that are sensible long-term reforms, too much of it amounts to an unwarranted and unacceptable power grab by the SNP.”

The consultation said those who supported the Bill argued it would “help the Scottish Government act more quickly in response to any future public health emergencies”.

But opponents said “relevant temporary powers could be reinstated or created again using the same processes” if there was another public health crisis, without making them permanent.

Negative impact on private landlords

Concerns were also raised that making it harder to evict tenants who had not paid their rent would have “a negative impact on private landlords and could risk driving them out of the market, potentially resulting in a shortage of affordable accommodation for rent”.

Unveiling the Bill, Mr Swinney said “many” of the temporary restrictions introduced during the pandemic had already been removed.

“However, we believe those pragmatic reforms that have delivered demonstrable benefit to the people of Scotland should continue,” he said.

“Whilst it has been incredibly disruptive, the urgency of the pandemic has driven the pace of digital adoption, and in some cases more efficient ways of working, and better service to the public.”",Telegraph,"['power', 'scottish', 'shameless', 'ministers', 'powers', 'public', 'accused', 'pandemic', 'temporary', 'legislation', 'covid', 'bill', 'restrictions', 'permanent', 'grab', 'snp']",0

Countries including France and Italy require all over-12s to prove their vaccination or recovered status to access their official Covid passes, which are needed to use services including ski lifts, restaurants and transport, or face additional restrictions.

In France, the government will consider an individual fully vaccinated if it is at least one week after their first dose of vaccine and they are able to prove they previously tested positive for Covid-19.

Under-16s will be given access to the NHS app in time for the school break, which will include a QR code for each vaccine dose they’ve received and any prior Covid infection.

But it has emerged that proof of immunity from previous infection will only be available to those who confirmed that infection via an NHS PCR test, and not from a lateral flow test (LFT).

People with a positive LFT are no longer required to take a confirmatory PCR, after the guidance was changed on January 11 due to the high Covid rates across England from the omicron variant.

Staff and secondary school pupils are also still “strongly encouraged” to take twice-weekly LFTs, according to Department for Education guidance, to pick up asymptomatic cases.

However, exposure to the virus as well as vaccination was found to give the best protection.

The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) published data on Wednesday comparing protection against infection by immunity status.

It found that during the time when delta was dominant in the US, case rates in California among those who were vaccinated but had never caught Covid-19 were 6.2-fold lower than people who had no protection from either vaccines or infection. The comparative figure for New York was 4.5-fold lower than the unprotected baseline.

However, the CDC says that cases were 29-fold and 14.7-fold lower in California and New York, respectively, for those who were unvaccinated but had previously tested positive.

The risk of catching the coronavirus was squashed even further if a person had both forms of protection - prior infection as well as vaccines - with case rates plummeting 32.5-fold in California and 19.8-fold in New York.

Experts at the CDC were keen to emphasise that a person who is unvaccinated would gain added protection from vaccination even if they previously had the virus.

The vaccine is also much safer than taking one’s chances with the coronavirus itself. For example, while the CDC was gathering data in the two US states from May 2021 through to November 2021, more than 130,000 residents of California and New York had died from Covid-19.

“The evidence in this report does not change our vaccination recommendations,” Dr Ben Silk of the CDC and one of the study’s authors told a media briefing.

“We know that vaccination is still the safest way to protect yourself against Covid-19.”

Virus wanes in previously infected people

Recent research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that protection from Covid-19 wanes in previously infected people who have not been vaccinated.

But, people who had been infected more than a year ago and who had also had their vaccines maintain more than 90 per cent protection against the virus.

The CDC study does not account for omicron, and does not take into consideration booster jabs.

UKHSA data show that getting a booster vaccine provides substantial protection against the new variant.

“Viruses are constantly changing, including the virus that causes Covid-19,” the CDC said in a statement.

“These changes occur over time and can lead to the emergence of new variants that have new characteristics, including ones that impact the level of immunity vaccination and/or prior infection can provide.”",Telegraph,"['protection', 'california', 'variant', 'gives', 'vaccination', 'covid', 'better', 'natural', 'york', 'immunity', 'previously', 'covid19', 'virus', 'cdc', 'delta', 'vaccines', 'data', 'infection']",0

2022-01-18 17:06:54+00:00,108,"Two thirds of side effects associated with the Covid-19 vaccine are likely to be caused by the ""nocebo effect"" - where people become ill because they expect to, scientists believe.

US researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) in Boston studied the rates of adverse events reported by 22,000 vaccine trial participants who received a real jab, compared with a similar number who received a dummy injection.

After one dose, more than 35 per cent of placebo participants experienced symptoms such as headaches, fever and swelling at the injection site, compared with 46 per cent of the vaccine group.

After a second dose, 32 per cent given a placebo reported side effects, compared with 61 per cent who had a real jab.

Analysis suggested that the nocebo effect accounted for 76 per cent of side effects after a first dose, and 52 per cent after a second, meaning that overall, around two thirds of symptoms were imagined.

Experts said that people should be warned they could experience nocebo symptoms in order to lessen fears.

‘Hyper alert to bodily feelings’

“Nonspecific symptoms like headache and fatigue are listed among the most common adverse reactions following Covid-19 vaccination in many information leaflets,” said senior author Ted Kaptchuk, director of the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter at BIDMC and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

“Evidence suggests that this sort of information may cause people to misattribute common daily background sensations as arising from the vaccine or cause anxiety and worry that make people hyper-alert to bodily feelings about adverse events.

“Medicine is based on trust. Our findings lead us to suggest that informing the public about the potential for nocebo responses could help reduce worries about Covid-19 vaccination, which might decrease vaccination hesitancy.”

‘Vaccine hesitancy’

The placebo effect is the phenomenon where a person’s physical or mental health improves after they receive a treatment with no pharmacological therapeutic benefit, such as a sugar pill or a syringe full of saline.

But sometimes placebo effects can also harm - the so-called nocebo effect occurs when a person experiences unpleasant side effects after a dummy treatment.

“Adverse events after placebo treatment are common in randomised controlled trials,” said lead author Dr Julia Haas, an investigator in the Program in Placebo Studies at BIDMC.

“Collecting systematic evidence regarding these nocebo responses in vaccine trials is important for Covid-19 vaccination worldwide, especially because concern about side effects is reported to be a reason for vaccine hesitancy.”

2022-01-17 11:43:17+00:00,24,"On Sunday, the Government said a further 70,924 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the UK.

The Department of Health reported 88 deaths on Sunday within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 - a 9.2 per cent decline on the 97 fatalities recorded on the same day the week before.

Plan B restrictions set to be lifted

Downing Street is looking at three different drives to ease pandemic restrictions, some short-term and some long-term.

The so-called Plan B restrictions are expected to be largely lifted on January 26, the review date that the Prime Minister set when he imposed them last month.

That means that the legal requirement for Covid passports - proof of full vaccination or a negative test - to be shown before entering large crowd venues is set to be dropped.

So too is guidance that urges people to work from home. However, a requirement to wear face masks on public transport, in shops and in other settings is likely to stay beyond January 26.

A second drive is easing restrictions on travel. The need to take a lateral flow test on the second day after arriving into the UK is expected to drop.

A third drive is longer-term changes, with Government ministers believing the UK will move out of the pandemic and into a phase where Covid continues circulating but less frequently.

The Prime Minister and his Cabinet has made clear that an approach of “learning to live with Covid” must be adopted, given scientists say the virus will never disappear completely.

Supporters of the move compare it to the approach for other viruses - such as flu - in which people are encouraged to behave a certain way but not legally compelled to do so.

But critics will question whether such a change in approach could lead to more people not avoiding others while they were infectious with coronavirus.

Any such change would only be adopted after government scientists have been consulted.

Labour's alternative roadmap

Labour announced its alternative roadmap for Britain to “learn to live well with Covid” on Sunday, as the party accused the Government of having “an empty slogan with no plan”.

Launching a 10-point plan, Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said Labour would build up “sovereign capability” to manufacture test kits in Britain and publish economic, wellbeing and equality impact assessments for different policies to tackle the virus.

“We’re not out of the woods with Covid-19,"" he said. ""The virus will change and adapt and we need to learn to live well with it.

2022-01-15 18:22:45+00:00,7,"Two vaccines and a previous infection provides 20 per cent more protection compared to recovering from the virus alone, a government study suggests.

The SIREN study, led by researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and funded by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), aims to understand how long immunity lasts from prior infection.

The latest findings, which are not yet peer reviewed, show two doses of a Covid vaccine on top of prior infection “significantly reduces” both symptomatic and asymptomatic Covid infection, compared to previous infection alone.

Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor of the UKHSA who led the study, shared the findings after the debate around protection from prior-infection was raised by Dr Steve James, a consultant anaesthetist at King’s College Hospital (KCH), London.

Dr James told Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, during a televised visit to the hospital that “the science is not strong enough” to warrant mandatory jabs for frontline NHS workers, and that he had acquired immunity through infection.

From April, Covid vaccinations are mandatory for frontline NHS workers.

The SIREN study shows those who are double jabbed have significantly more protection a year after infection.

More than 35,000 healthcare workers were included in the study, which tracked participants between December 2020 and September 2021.

Omicron data being analysed

The findings show unvaccinated persons who had Covid developed 85 per cent protection against infection three to nine months after, but this dropped 73 per cent protection more than 15 months after infection.

However, double vaccinated people who tested positive three to nine months prior had 91 per cent protection, and more than 15 months after infection they still had over 90 per cent protection.

“In this pre-print, which is under peer review, we demonstrate that two doses of vaccination on top of prior infection significantly reduces both asymptomatic [and] symptomatic infection compared to infection alone,” Dr Hopkins said.

She added the research group is beginning to analyse data from the current omicron wave.

“The consensus from immunologists [and] infection experts is, getting a boost to your immunity from vaccination on top of prior infection will reduce asymptomatic [and] symptomatic infection [and therefore] reducing transmission,” she said.

Immunity by previous infection 'wanes'

The authors of the study concluded protection from infection-acquired immunity showed “evidence of waning” in unvaccinated persons at follow-up, but remained “consistently over 90 per cent in those who received two doses of vaccine, even in those infected over 15-months ago”.

Separately, the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine said they encourage all members and other NHS staff to take up the offer of a vaccine.

“We note that the overwhelming majority of our members have been vaccinated regardless of prior infection, in line with the scientific evidence,” the two bodies said in a joint statement earlier this week.

“Collectively, we need to listen to and acknowledge the concerns of those healthcare workers who have chosen so far not to be vaccinated, so that they are supported to make the best health choices for their patients, their families and themselves.

“A comparison of the protection from prior infection and protection via vaccination is not a matter on which RCoA nor FICM has any expertise. However, we note the advice of experts in epidemiology and virology that the immunity gained from vaccination is stronger and longer lasting than that from infection.”",Telegraph,"['infected', 'months', 'prior', 'significantly', 'risk', 'vaccination', 'covid', 'doublejabbed', 'workers', 'previously', 'immunity', 'cent', 'protection', 'study', 'infection']",0

Professor Chuang Yin-ching, a senior member of Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control (CDC), has now had two years to draw conclusions from a defining point in his career, when he was dispatched to Wuhan on January 13-15, 2020, to investigate reports of a new Sars-like coronavirus.

In an interview with The Telegraph this week, he recalled the moment he grasped the seriousness of the situation during a meeting where experts from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau grilled officials from the Wuhan and Hubei province CDC and the central government authorities in Beijing.

From the outset, the local officials and chairperson had appeared evasive, insisting there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission despite repeated questioning.

“Different people asked over and again about the issue of human-to-human transmission from different angles. For example, ‘do Wuhan people like to eat game meat?’ He answered, ‘people in Wuhan don’t like to eat game meat’. Everybody laughed,” he said.

Prof Chuang pressed for information about two known family clusters, including one unexplained, significant case of a husband who worked at the Huanan seafood market – the suspected ground zero of the outbreak – who appeared to have passed the virus onto his wife who had not visited the location.

“I asked, other than two clusters are there any other similar situations? He said no. What I wanted to know is, other than two clusters, maybe there is a third cluster of cases? He said no. My real question was ‘is there a possibility of human-to-human transmission?’” he explained.

“And finally, because I was sitting in front of the local and central government authorities I could see the body language – he [Beijing official] tried to intervene, he put up his hand to try to stop the local authorities talking,” he said.

“Finally, the person from the central government said ‘why did you say the old conclusion? Now the conclusion is limited human-to human transmission cannot be excluded’. That was the answer we wanted to know.”

“Dozens” of officials from Cabinet Office’s Covid-19 taskforce attended the event on Dec 17 2020, to mark the departure of Kate Josephs, the director-general at the time, The Telegraph has been told.

The revelation comes after No 10 was forced to issue an apology to the Queen on Friday, after this newspaper revealed that two parties were held in Downing Street the night before the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral.

Confirming that an apology had been issued to Buckingham Palace over the April 16 events, a No 10 spokesman told reporters it was “deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning”.

The parties are now being investigated by Sue Gray as part of her probe into multiple allegations of lockdown-breaking parties.

On Friday, sources confirmed that the Dec 17 party for Ms Josephs, who is now the chief executive of Sheffield City Council, is also being examined.

A source who worked closely with Ms Josephs said on Friday “she literally wrote the rules”. They also claimed that she had played a leading role in the negotiations with local areas over the tiered system, which remained in force at the time of her leaving do.

2022-01-13 20:19:42+00:00,19,"A “Harvard-educated” fugitive who faked his own death in an attempt to escape fraud and sexual assault allegations in America has been discovered in a Glasgow hospital after he caught Covid-19.

Extradition proceedings have begun against Nicholas Rossi, who was using the fake name Arthur Knight when he was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and was later placed on a ventilator.

The death of the 34-year-old, who also used the surname Alahverdian, was announced in February 2020.

An “obituary” claimed that he was cremated and his ashes “scattered at sea” following a quick demise from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer.

It was reported that he died with his wife and two children at his bedside and an obituary even recounted his last words: “Fear not and run toward the bliss of the sun.”

In fact, he had fled across to Atlantic to evade arrest on fraud and sexual assault probes in two US states, prosecutors in the Utah County Attorney’s Office believe.

“He certainly has gone to elaborate means to hide himself,” David Leavitt, the county attorney, told The Washington Post. “I’ve been practising law, both as a prosecutor and a defence attorney for 30 years. This is a first.”

He lived a warriors's life

Rossi was known in Rhode Island for his calls to reform the state’s child welfare system. He had worked as an aide in the state legislature, where a formal resolution was lodged in March 2020 paying a gushing tribute which claimed he lived a “warrior’s life”.

His fake obituary described him as a Harvard alumni, although it has been claimed he attended but did not graduate.

Doubts about his death emerged after no death certificate was issued in Ireland, where it was claimed he had moved to. NHS workers in Glasgow discovered that he was wanted by Interpol and he was arrested by Scottish police.

Before his disappearance, he was being investigated by the FBI over fraud allegations in Ohio and was subject of a Rhode Island arrest warrant for failing to register as a sex offender following a conviction in 2008.

His DNA had been linked in 2020 to “a number of similar [sexual assault] offences in Utah and throughout the United States”, according to the county attorney’s office.

He appeared via videolink in extradition proceedings on December 23.

""We had reached such a level of exasperation, fatigue, and anger that we had no other option than to stage a strike to send a strong message to the government,"" said Elisabeth Allain-Moreno, national secretary of the SE-UNSA teachers union.

Mr Macron has prided himself on keeping French schools open more than any other country in the world, this week saying: “I fundamentally believe the choice that we made to keep schools open is the right choice.”

But a huge surge in the highly contagious omicron variant has sparked chaos in schools since the start of the year, with 10,000 classes closed because of infections among pupils and staff. Daily new infections have topped 360,000 of late.

Queues have snaked outside pharmacies since January 1 as parents and children try to keep up with testing requirements in the case of a positive case in a class.

France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, finally relaxed the rules this week, saying that a series of home tests could now be used to determine whether a student can return to school. Children over the age of six must wear masks in French schools.

""I know it's tough, but a strike does not solve problems. One does not strike against a virus,” said Mr Blanquer.

But in a rare show of unity, some 11 unions issued a joint statement saying: ”The exhaustion and exasperation of the entire educational community have reached an unprecedented level.”

""The responsibility of the minister and the government in this chaotic situation is total because of incessant changes of footing, unworkable protocols and the lack of appropriate tools to guarantee (schools) can function properly.”

The strike has been seized upon by Mr Macron’s rivals ahead of April presidential elections.

Damien Abad, education advisor to conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse of the Republicans party and Mr Macron’s most dangerous presidential rival, said the strike was “against Mr Blanquer and this government and their Kafkaesque vision of health protocols.”

Ms Pécresse had called for on government to defer the start of the January term to allow schools to prepare and to slow transmission rates.

Manuel Bompard, spokesman for Leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, said the strike relayed “a huge exasperation in the teaching world” against the government’s handling of the health crisis.

Brice Teinturier, political scientist at the Ipsos polling institute, said the stakes were high for Mr Macron.

“Until now, the French have considered the government and President Macron to have handled the crisis correctly”,” he told AFP. But if chaos continued in schools, “that balance risks being broken”.

Adelaïde Zulfikarpasic of BVA Opinion said that France’s mainly Left-wing teachers were a key electorate for the centrist Mr Macron, who is seen as having moved Right during his five-year term.

“The rump of his voters came from the Left in 2017”, she said, adding that they may be reluctant to back him this time.

While all polls currently see Mr Macron breezing into the second round of presidential elections, one on Wednesday for the first time placed him neck and neck with Ms Pécresse should she reach the runoff.

Downing Street confirmed that Ms Gray resigned with immediate effect on Thursday. The move prompted criticism from allies of Boris Johnson who, in light of the news, accused the partygate inquiry of being a “plot” against the former PM.

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Labour Party has offered Sue Gray the role of chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition."" They added she hoped to accept the role.

The civil servant is well known for delivering a long-awaited report of her investigation into the Downing Street parties. She was selected after Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, had to recuse himself when it emerged an event had taken place in his own office.

But who is Ms Gray, and why is her latest move so controversial? Here, we explain all.

Lockdown report

Ms Gray had the task of investigating a series of alleged lockdown parties held in Downing Street and across government during the Covid pandemic. The report has now been completed, with the initial findings that there were ""failings of leadership and judgment"".

The report, which was published on gov.uk, consisted of 12 pages and revealed that 12 gatherings were subject to Metropolitan Police investigation.

The Prime Minister had been questioned by Ms Gray over the partygate allegations he and other MPs faced and The Telegraph understands that he shared all he knew with the civil servant.

Dominic Cummings was also interviewed by Ms Gray as part of her investigation. Mr Johnson's former top aide, who has been critical of the Prime Minister since leaving No10, has previously claimed on his blog that he and other witnesses were prepared to swear under oath that Mr Johnson had ""lied to Parliament about parties"".

However, Mr Cummings refused to meet Ms Gray in person as he feared Mr Johnson would ""spin it to the media"" and instead emailed his responses.

Ominously for the Prime Minister, an MP once described her as “deputy god”, while Sir Oliver Letwin admitted when in Cabinet that it had taken him “precisely two years before I realised who it is that runs Britain"", adding: ""Our great United Kingdom is actually entirely run by a lady called Sue Gray. Nothing moves in Whitehall unless Sue says so.”

A controversial move

Ms Gray's move into the roll as Sir Starmer's Chief of Staff is hugely controversial because Ms Gray's report contributed to the resignation of Mr Johnson as prime minister.

Since the news, Conservative MP's have hit out at the former civil servant. Many have argued her move to Labour's staff shows that the report was not impartial, with Jacob Rees-Mogg calling it a ""Left-wing stitch-up"".

A friend of Mr Johnson said: ""What was supposed to be an investigation by independent civil servants is now revealed to have been carried out by someone who ultimately would go on to work for Keir Starmer.""

Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said that it was “utterly ludicrous” to suggest that the appointment undermines Ms Gray's report.

Number 10 is set to investigate the circumstances of Ms Gray’s resignation, it is understood. She will also be expected to abide by any restrictions imposed on her by the Acoba watchdog, which looks at which jobs former politicians and senior officials can take.

'A straight shooter'

Friends have in the past called Ms Gray a “straight shooter” who would leave no stone unturned in getting to the truth about the various parties - Downing Street calls them “gatherings” - but would also investigate the “culture” inside Number 10 that allowed them to occur in the first place.

They point out the irony that had she been in the Cabinet Office at the time of the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, Ms Gray would have put a stop to any parties once she had wind of them.

For six years, she was director-general, propriety and ethics, in the Cabinet Office.

She ran inquiries into 'plebgate' - in which Andrew Mitchell, the former chief whip, was accused of insulting a police officer - and into allegations that Damian Green had used his parliamentary computer to access pornography. Mr Green, then deputy prime minister, was forced to resign.

Ms Gray held senior civil service posts under a number of prime ministers, both Labour and Conservative, and was thought as someone who had pulled off the trick of keeping politicians in the dark about her own political leanings.

Public servant in a public house

Ms Gray and her husband, Bill Conlon, an acclaimed country and western singer, bought a pub, with family connections, called The Cove in the late 1980s. They ran it for a number of years before she returned to the Civil Service, working across Whitehall in transport, health and work and pensions, before joining the Cabinet Office in the late 1990s.

She served in Northern Ireland as permanent secretary in Stormont’s department of finance, but was passed over for the top job of head of the Northern Ireland civil service in 2020.

In a rare interview, she told the BBC that she had “really wanted the job” but felt she had been passed over because “people may have thought that I perhaps was too much of a challenger, or a disruptor”.

She returned to the Cabinet Office in May 2021 to take up the post of second permanent secretary with the responsibility for the Union and Constitution.

British teenagers aged 12 and over can now receive a second dose of the vaccine, although uptake has been slow. Approximately one in two 12- to 15-year-olds have not yet received a first dose, and only 50 per cent of 16- to 17 year-olds have received a second jab.

Italy is seeing a seven-day Covid-19 case rate of 1,833 cases per 100,000, slightly higher than the UK’s 1,814 cases per 100,000. That number is 2,853 in France and 1,740 in Switzerland. In Austria there are 598 cases per 100,000.

The super green pass is a requirement to board public transport, to enter hotels and to visit bars or restaurants (including outdoor areas), along with museums, cultural spaces and festivals.

2022-01-09 07:01:44+00:00,1,"A Covid ""trust threshold"" below which restrictions do not work has been discovered by scientists - and Britain sits right on the cusp.

Research by the University of Exeter has found that countries in which at least 40 per cent of citizens agree that ""most people can be trusted"" were found to have used restrictions to effectively reduce cases and deaths during 2020.

More trusting societies tended to achieve a faster decline in infections and deaths from peak levels, but those below 40 per cent struggled to bring the virus under control.

The researchers believe the effect happens because behaviours needed to stop the spread of coronavirus, such as mask wearing and social distancing, depend on mutual trust to be effective.

Previous studies show levels of trust in the UK are at the critical 40 per cent, compared to more than 60 per cent in Scandinavian countries. China also has high levels of trust within society.

'Building trust should be a long-term project'

Professor Tim Lenton, of the University of Exeter, said: “Our results add to evidence that trust within society benefits resilience to epidemics.

“Building trust within communities should be a long-term project for all nations because this will help them cope with future pandemics and other challenges such as extreme events caused by climate change.”

The researchers studied data from more than 150 countries, looking at how easily they managed to control cases and deaths before vaccines were available.

Up to December 1 2020, 156 countries had experienced at least one peak and then decline of cases and deaths.

For bringing down cases, Mauritius was found to be the most resilient and Costa Rica the least. For deaths, Slovakia was best while Romania, Mexico and Indonesia were worst.

They discovered that although most governments applied similarly stringent restrictions, there was hugely varying success in whether they controlled the spread of the virus.

All countries where more than 40 per cent of respondents agreed “most people can be trusted” achieved a near complete reduction of new cases and deaths.",Telegraph,"['rules', 'researchers', 'trust', 'cusp', 'countries', 'uk', 'cases', '40', 'restrictions', 'university', 'covid', 'discover', 'deaths', 'levels', 'cent', 'threshold', 'trusted', 'work']",0

His claim to have been granted a vaccine exemption to enter Australia because he contracted Covid-19 last month has now raised questions over his movements when he tested positive.

In court documents published on Saturday, his legal team stated that the Serbian recorded a positive test on Dec 16, and had ""not had a fever or respiratory symptoms of Covid-19 in the last 72 hours"".

2022-01-07 19:23:26+00:00,2,"Fourth Covid vaccines are not currently needed, government scientific advisers have said, amid increasing evidence that the omicron strain is much milder than previous variants.

On Friday night, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announced that booster jabs continue to provide high levels of protection against severe disease from omicron in older adults, including the most vulnerable.

The committee's analysis found that, three months after receiving a third jab, protection against hospitalisation among those aged 65 and over remains at around 90 per cent.

Ministers have been exploring the possibility of a fourth jab for several weeks after Israel, considered a global pioneer in Covid vaccination, launched such a programme last month.

But Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI's chairman of Covid immunisation, said: ""The current data show the booster dose is continuing to provide high levels of protection against severe disease, even for the most vulnerable older age groups.

""For this reason, the committee has concluded there is no immediate need to introduce a second booster dose, though this will continue to be reviewed.""

It comes as Covid numbers in Britain fell for a third day in a row and evidence emerged that hospitalisations arising from virus cases were 12 times lower than during last year's winter peak.

There were 178,250 cases reported in the UK on Friday, down from 179,756 the previous day and a daily fall of more than 11,000 from the previous week.

New figures from Scotland show that just one per cent of people who test positive for Covid are ending up in hospital – down from 12 per cent last January.

Data from England show that the number of patients in mechanical ventilation beds has fallen to 728 – a decline of 63 in a week and the lowest it has been since October.

Speaking during a visit to King's College Hospital in south London, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: ""When we look at omicron versus the previous variants, of course there are some encouraging signs. We know now that omicon is less severe.""

However, Mr Javid emphasised the need for people to come forward for their booster jabs amid ""challenging times"" for the NHS.",Telegraph,"['protection', 'fourth', 'say', 'jcvi', 'vaccination', 'covid', 'times', 'severe', 'necessary', 'experts', 'older', 'omicron', 'wont', 'booster', 'provide', 'vaccines', 'previous']",0

""We want to slow down the curve of contagion and encourage Italians who have not yet been vaccinated to do so,"" Prime Minister Mario Draghi said during a cabinet meeting at which the measure was adopted, according to a statement.

""We are working in particular on the age groups that are most at risk of being hospitalised, to reduce pressure on hospitals to save lives,"" he added.

In another statement, the government said that ""the vaccine pass will be necessary for people over 50 in the public and private sectors to access their workplace from February 15.""

Out of Italy's 59 million people, 28 million are over the age of 50, according to the Istat national statistics agency.

2022-01-05 13:50:15+00:00,3,"The Premier League has told its 20 clubs that their Covid-19 testing regime will no longer include twice-weekly PCR tests for players and staff, with a greater reliance on lateral flow tests (LFTs) to keep track of the changing picture of infections.

The league’s chief executive Richard Masters wrote to clubs to tell them that, from Thursday, the focus will be on LFTs with players and staff undergoing them the day before matches and on all training days. Anyone returning a positive test will still have to take a laboratory-checked PCR test for confirmation.

The switch is in line with the new government policy that will place less emphasis on PCR tests. The Premier League’s clinical oversight group believe that the most effective method of surveilling the infection among players is to use LFTs. The data has shown some PCRs returning positive cases long after the virus has cleared. The clubs were told that the twice-weekly PCRs were no longer providing the benefits they did at the start of the Omicron outbreak.

The Telegraph has reported that across the public government health officials have drawn up plans to restrict PCR tests to those who display symptoms. Under those measures anyone who is asymptomatic - around 40 per cent of cases - will be able to return to work more swiftly. Premier League footballers and staff testing positive will still take a PCR, but will no longer be subject to the mandatory twice-weekly PCR tests.

The Premier League is facing a backlog of games because of the postponements over the Christmas period, although for the time being the focus switches to the League Cup semi-finals and the FA Cup third-round weekend. The league fixture schedule does not resume until Tuesday. There are still 19 postponed games on the Premier League’s official fixture list which are yet to be designated a date. As things stand, 91 per cent of fixtures scheduled to date have been fulfilled.

The Premier League is still in what it terms “emergency measures” implemented in mid-December which have seen a marked increase in the testing programme and greater restrictions placed on social mixing at training grounds and stadiums. The most recent cohort of 14,250 tests carried out in the period from Dec 27 to Sunday returned 94 new positive cases.

More than three in five adults - 63 per cent - are at increased risk of disease and becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 because they are overweight, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.

A new Better Health marketing campaign with 15 weight loss and fitness organisations will help people understand these risks and provide tools and resources to lose excess weight.

The public can benefit from free and discounted offers from organisations involved in the campaign, including WW - formerly Weight Watchers - Slimming World, PureGym and Sport England. They involve weight loss programmes and virtual workouts.

A multimedia campaign will also highlight the serious health conditions that can be prevented by losing weight, including six key benefits.

The benefits that could have a lasting impact on a person’s health include a decreased risk of common cancers, lowered risk of increased blood pressure, reduced risk of heart disease, reduced risk of developing diabetes, decreased risk of being hospitalised or becoming seriously ill with Covid, and less strain from chronic back and joint pain.

Obesity costs NHS billions of pounds

In 2019/20, of hospital admissions where obesity was a factor, joint pain was the second most common primary diagnosis - with more than 31,000 admissions for knee joint issues.

Authorities in Yuzhou, in the central Henan province, announced that starting from Monday evening, all residents had to stay home to control the spread of the virus.

Communities were required to set up “sentinels and gates to strictly implement epidemic prevention and control measures.”

The city has halted all bus and taxi services and shuttered schools, shopping malls and tourist attractions. Only businesses providing daily necessities are allowed to continue to operate.

One person visiting Yuzhou from out of town wrote on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, that they were woken up at 4am at the hotel where they were staying and asked to move to a different hotel to undergo quarantine.

“I’m disappointed with the measures,” the user wrote, adding that they hoped their Weibo account would not be suspended after commenting.

Beijing has been censoring criticism of its Covid-19-related policies and has punished whistleblowers and citizen journalists who reported on the initial outbreak in Wuhan.

2022-01-03 16:01:37+00:00,4,"Oxford University academics raised a record amount of cash for their own businesses last year after the success of its Covid-19 work lured new backers to the city.

A total of £1.4bn was invested into businesses which have been spun out from the university in 2021, data shows, up from £1.1bn a year earlier and £380m in 2019.

It signals a major uptick in interest in academic ventures. In 2018, spin-outs across UK universities as a whole raised only £1.5bn.

The spike in backing for companies formed from Oxford University research follows a series of high-profile triumphs for the institution, including the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is now one of the most widely used around the world.

The vaccine was based on findings from Vaccitech, a company co-founded by Professor Sarah Gilbert and spun out of the university's Jenner Institute.

It was manufactured at a facility run by Oxford Biomedica, another spin-out.

Alexis Dormandy, chief executive of the university investment company Oxford Science Enterprises, said: ""Oxford is fast becoming a powerhouse for the creation of world-changing spinouts. Covid-19 shone a spotlight on the University, its world-class academics and science.""

Last year, more than 26 start-ups and spinouts were created in Oxford, slightly down on the 28 launched a year earlier, but still significantly more than the 18 launched in 2019.

The findings came as separate data compiled by PitchBook showed more cash was invested into UK biotech businesses last year than in any previous one.

According to the report, £1.5bn was invested into the sector in 2021 in a total of 165 deals - almost double the amount that went into UK biotech businesses a year earlier, at a time when investors were still grappling with what the pandemic would mean for their prospects.

Venture capital firms have become increasingly interested in biotech businesses because of their role during the pandemic, as they partnered with some of the larger pharmaceutical companies to get treatments to millions of people.

Pfizer, for example, partnered with German biotech BioNTech for its Covid jab.

Others, including Oxford Nanopore, have been pivotal in helping to map virus mutations, with the company's technology used for around a fifth of all Covid-19 sequencing globally.",Telegraph,"['businesses', 'vaccine', 'biotech', 'invested', 'record', 'university', 'uk', 'success', 'covid', 'raise', 'earlier', 'universitys', 'spinouts', 'covid19', 'academics', '14bn', 'oxford']",0
